Pittsburgh (/ˈpɪtsbɜːrɡ/ PITS-burg) is a city "City (Pennsylvania)") in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-8) It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania with a population of 302,971 at the 2020 census, while the Pittsburgh metropolitan area at over 2.43 million residents is the largest metropolitan area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and 28th-largest in the U.S. The greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia.

Pittsburgh is known as "the Steel City" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-PittsburghNames-9) It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-10) For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-11) Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-diaspora-12) However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Lubove-1995-14)

Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-edu-15) The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-16) The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-PittsburghNames-9) Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Ritenbaugh-17) The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.
Etymology

\ [edit\]

Main article: Name of Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes "John Forbes (British Army officer)"), in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh).[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-spell-18)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-19)

Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough "Borough (Pennsylvania)") on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-20)
"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever."[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-21)

From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as "Pittsburg", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-22)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-spell-18) After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-spell-18) The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-23)

\ [edit\]

The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-24) Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville "Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh)") neighborhood.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Hanna1-25): 289

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bouquetblockhouse.JPG) Fort Pitt Block House, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.

The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-26)\ [better source needed\] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-chronology-27)

In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada "Canada (New France)") with French Louisiana "Louisiana (New France)") via the rivers.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-chronology-27) During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-WDL-28) The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt "Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)"), named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named "Pittsborough".[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Lorant-29)

During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-EB1911-30)[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-31)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-32)[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-33)

During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "Manor of Pittsburgh".[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-PCC-34) Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.

On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-35)[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-36) William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-37)

Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt "Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)") (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.

The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-38) Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-39)

The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.

In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine "Great Famine (Ireland)"). By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany.

Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-freedom-40) The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-exhibit-41) Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-freedom-40)

The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.

In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.

The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-43)

The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.

The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-44) Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration "Great Migration (African American)") from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-45) Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-46)

During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Lorant-29) This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy"[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-47)[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-48) was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off."[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-49)

Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. The "Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-diaspora-12)

In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.
21st century

\ [edit\]

During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-50)

In September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-51)

Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.

The city is located on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau "Western Allegheny Plateau (ecoregion)").[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-52) The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as "the Point." The city extends east to include the Oakland "Oakland (Pittsburgh)") and Shadyside "Shadyside (Pittsburgh)") sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.

Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to "hills," "heights," or similar features.[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-53)

The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-54) Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-55)

Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles \[539 km\] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.

Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia."[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-66) In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the "Paris of Appalachia",[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-67)[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-68)[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-69)[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-70) recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.

Under the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate ( Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-71)[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-72)[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-73) The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-74) The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-NOAAsun-75)

The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-NOAA-76) a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-NOAA-76) Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-NOAA-76)[\[b\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-77) Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-NOAA-76)

Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-78) On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-79) There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-80) In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).

Air quality

\ [edit\]

United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate.[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-86)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-87)

Despite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Frazier-2020-88) It also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Frazier-2020-88) Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-89)

As of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's urban forest between $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-90)
Water quality

\ [edit\]

Local rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to frequently overflowing untreated sewage from the city's outdated infrastructure.[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-91) Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-92) Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-93)[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-94) Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers per year, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-95) The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.[\[92\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-96)[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-97)[\[94\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-98)

The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.[\[95\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-puc-99)[\[96\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-100)[\[97\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-101) While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.[\[98\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Morrison-2021-102)[\[99\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-103)[\[100\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-104) In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[\[101\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-www.pgh2o.com-2023-105) PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[\[101\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-www.pgh2o.com-2023-105)

There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.[\[102\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Marusic-106) Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[\[102\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Marusic-106)[\[103\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-107)

Demographic changes

\ [edit\]

Since the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in Pittsburgh. In the 1950s, the Lower Hill District underwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the Civic Arena "Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)"), which opened in 1961.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Lubove-1995-14) This project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.[\[123\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Klein-2017-128)

In the 1960s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) aimed to revitalize East Liberty "East Liberty (Pittsburgh)"), resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.[\[124\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Gillette-2022-129) By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.[\[124\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Gillette-2022-129)

These changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.[\[123\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Klein-2017-128)[\[125\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-130) The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.[\[126\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-131)

The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called Pittsburghese, was influenced by Scots-Irish, German, and Eastern European immigrants and African Americans.[\[186\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-191) Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as " Yinzers" (from the local word "yinz" \[var. yunz\], a blended form of "you ones", similar to "y'all" and "you all" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: "slippy" (slippery), "redd up" (clean up), "jagger bush" (thorn bush), and "gum bands" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb "to be". In Pittsburghese one would say "the car needs washed" instead of "needs to be washed", "needs washing", or "needs a wash." The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as "the Galapagos Islands of American dialect".[\[187\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-192) The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include babushka, pierogi, and halušky.[\[188\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-193)

The Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos (derived from buccaneer), is the city's oldest professional sports franchise, having been founded in 1881, and plays in the Central Division of the National League "National League (baseball)"). The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park.

Pittsburgh also has a rich Negro league history, with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones "Pittsburgh Keystones (baseball)") fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, "No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh."[\[199\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-209)

Since the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014–2015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[\[200\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-210)

The city's professional team, NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, is named after the distribution company the Pittsburgh Steeling company established in 1927. News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events and are important to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[\[201\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-211) The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[\[202\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-212) The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009.

College football in the city dates to 1889[\[203\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-213) with the Division I "Division I (NCAA)") (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships, qualifying 37 total bowl games, appearing in the 2018 ACC Championship Game, and winning the 2021 ACC Championship Game which was the program's first conference title since leaving the Big East "Big East Conference (1979–2013)") for the ACC between the 2012 and 2013 seasons.[\[204\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-214) Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams.

Ice hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones "Pittsburgh Keystones (ice hockey)"). The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[\[207\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-iceskating-217)

The NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship-winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates "Pittsburgh Pirates (hockey)") made several Stanley Cup playoff runs before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons.

In 2006, Council President Luke Ravenstahl was sworn in as mayor at age 26, becoming the youngest mayor in the history of any major American city. His successor, Bill Peduto, was sworn in on January 6, 2014. In November 2021, Pittsburgh elected its first African-American mayor, Ed Gainey.

Prior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party,[\[216\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-226) as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.[\[217\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-227)

Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts ( Lindsey Williams (D)- 38, Wayne D.

The area's largest law enforcement agency is the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, with close to 850 sworn officers. The city also has separate housing and school police departments. Other agencies also provide police protection within the city because of overlapping jurisdictional boundaries. The Allegheny County Sheriff focuses on jail and courthouse security. The Allegheny County Police primarily patrols county-owned parks and airports, while providing detective/investigatory functions for smaller suburbs and the Port Authority police patrols rapid transit. Pennsylvania State Police Troop B provides patrols for the city and immediate suburbs.

The county's lead law enforcement officer is Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala while the Allegheny County Medical Examiner heads forensics. Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania.
Crime

Pittsburgh annually ranks as one of America's safest big cities, in 2013 being named the 3rd "most secure" big city by Farmers Insurance.[\[218\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-228) Among crime rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities, 43 had more instances of property crime while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.[\[219\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-229)[\[220\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-230)
Per 100,000 persons stats (2012):

|  | Murder | Rape | Robbery | Assault | Burglary | Theft | Motor vehicle | Total violent | Total property |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

At the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[\[221\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-231)

In Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average.[\[222\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Byrdsong-2015-232) Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates.[\[222\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Byrdsong-2015-232) There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.[\[223\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Benzing-2016-233) This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.[\[223\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-Benzing-2016-233) This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.[\[224\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-234) About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.[\[225\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-235)

Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories "police budget cost per person," "fines / forefeitures," "Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population)," "Force Used per Arrest," "Racial Disparities in Deadly Force," "Excessive Force Complaints Upheld," "Discrimination Complaints Upheld," "Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld," "Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses," and "Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests."

Allegheny General Hospital

The two largest area health care providers are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny Health Network (since 1882).

The first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic Plain—General Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to 1845.[\[262\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-272) Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first "Mercy Hospital".[\[263\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-273) This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-chronology-27) the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[\[264\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-274)

In 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($1.08 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl.[\[265\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-275) In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5-year-old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, starting its transplant program.[\[266\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-276) Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($660 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[\[267\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-277) UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[\[268\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-278)

The $80 million ($146 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30 million ($53.3 million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The $130 million ($227 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($699 million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.\ [citation needed\]

In 2009, the $600 million ($876 million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[\[269\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-279) UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[\[270\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-280) UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[\[271\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-281)
Health discoveries

\ [edit\]

While he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955.

UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[\[272\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-282) the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[\[273\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-283)[\[274\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-284)

The Lancet published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[\[275\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-285)

Pittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[\[276\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-venice-286) it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title "City of Bridges".[\[277\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-287) Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The southwestern "entrance" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino "Rivers Casino (Pittsburgh)"). The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[\[278\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-288)

Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the "parkways." Interstate 376 is both the "parkway east" connecting to Interstate 76 "Interstate 76 (Ohio–New Jersey)") ( Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the "parkway west" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The "parkway north" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The "crosstown" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped "beltway" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region.

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SteelPlazaSubwayStation.JPG) Steel Plaza subway station "Steel Plaza (PAT station)")

Pittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[\[281\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-291) Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an "incline") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[\[282\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-292) Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[\[283\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-293) but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares.

The Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the "T") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview "Beechview (Pittsburgh)"), and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook "Overbrook (Pittsburgh)").
Freight rail

\ [edit\]

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PittsburghPennStation(6962200876).jpg) Union Station "Union Station (Pittsburgh)"), built in 1903

Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad "Union Railroad (Pittsburgh)") in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.

Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh.
Port

\ [edit\]

The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011. The port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[\[284\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#citenote-294)
