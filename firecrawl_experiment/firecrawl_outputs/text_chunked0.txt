jasujazumdinski
How much is it?
Amusement Tax is imposed at the rate of 5% of the gross admission charge for the amusement venue or event. No deductions are allowed for any costs or expenses that you incur in providing the amusement.
For an amusement (entertainment) at a place where food and drink are served where there is no fixed charge for admission, the Amusement Tax will be based on 10% of the total amount paid for food and drink. For example, if a check for food and drink by a party of four amounts to $80.00, the admission charge is 10% of the total check, or $8.00. $8.00 admission charge X 5% = $ .40 Amusement Tax.
Where admission is obtained to any amusement solely or partly by a donation, contribution and other monetary charge, the established price for amusement for purposes of the tax shall be twenty-five (25%) percent of the total donation, contribution and other monetary charge.
When amusement is conducted at a social club or fraternal organization which also furnishes entertainment for which a separate charge is not made, the established price shall be fifty (50%) percent of the gross receipts

Can you be excused from collecting the tax and paying the tax to the City?

jasujazumdinski
Yes. Employers must discontinue withholding the Local Services Tax when (i) the total earned income from all sources within the City of Pittsburgh is less than $12,000; (ii) the employee is on active duty in the military; or (iii) the employee is an honorably discharged veteran of the armed forces with a 100% service-connected-disability.

The employer is supposed to withhold the Local Services Tax for the municipality associated with the principal work location of the employee. For example, if the employee has $10 in Local Services Tax withheld for Municipality “A” and changes her job location to the City in the same calendar year, then the employee must provide the employer an exemption certificate. Having received the timely filed exemption certificate, the employer only has to withhold $42 ($52 less $10 paid to Municipality “A”) in City Local Services Tax from the employee.
What happens if the employee changes his employer during the year?

jasujazumdinski
The employee is supposed to provide the employer an exemption certificate showing how much Local Services Tax has been withheld during the current year. No more than $52 in Local Services Tax can be withheld by all employers from a particular employee.
