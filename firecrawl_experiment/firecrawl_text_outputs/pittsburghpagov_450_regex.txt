The City of Pittsburgh Department of Law Presents:
Pittsburgh’s City Solicitor
A Brief History
Version 1. Prepared September, $\mathbf { 1 5 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } } :$ , 2025.
Why Research Our City Solicitors?
This historic Solicitor research is a vital step forward in understanding and promoting the rich institutional history of Pittsburgh’s Law Department. From 1816, when Pittsburgh first achieved the designation of City, to today, no comprehensive list of Solicitors for the City has ever been compiled. This absence of information called for a new research initiative to gather what data was available, before more information could be lost.
As such, the research is ongoing and welcomes input from interested individuals and organizations. What has been uncovered thus far has been researched and arranged for publication by Elizabeth Begley, Record Specialist for the Law Department. Special thanks are due to the Pittsburgh City Archives and the Heinz History Center for their research assistance.
Introduction
In addition to the names and terms served by each Solicitor, biographic information such as birth date, date of death, interment location, and notable achievements are included where applicable. The information provided is just a glimpse into the life of each Solicitor and is by no means exhaustive. Restricted by limited information and research capacities, the information provided will vary by Solicitor. There is no Solicitor information for the years 1832-1834, and 1840, yet.

What is a City Solicitor?
Appointed by City Council as the Chief Legal Officer for Pittsburgh, the City Solicitor represents the City at all levels of the Commonwealth and Federal Court Systems. This representation includes many forms of litigation such as tort, civil rights, employment, and zoning/development. The City Solicitor also provides expert legal counsel to various city departments, ensuring that the city is adhering to all necessary laws and regulations during their daily operations.
