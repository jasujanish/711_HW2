Policy
Inclusionary Zoning
Inclusionary Zoning (IZ) ensures that neighborhoods can offer new housing units by tying the construction of affordable housing to that of market-rate housing. It is used in a variety of cities across the country, and was identified by the Cityâ€™s Affordable Housing Task Force ( AHTF, 2016) as a tool that could work here in Pittsburgh to address the shortage of affordable units.
Inclusionary Zoning applies to new construction or major renovation of projects that include 20 or more residential units for sale or for rent
Projects that meet the size threshold would need to price 10% of units affordably (rounding up if a fraction)
Currently, the Inclusionary Zoning ordinance is applicable in Lawrenceville, Bloomfield, Polish Hill, and Oakland (excluding the EMI Zoning District).
