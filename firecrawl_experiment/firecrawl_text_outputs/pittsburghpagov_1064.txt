Eliminating Racial Disparities(show below)
Previous column Next column
| Task Force Recommended Actions | Steps We Have Already Taken | Steps We Plan To Take | Anticipated Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) and the City of Pittsburgh should gather and analyze more data on routine police actions, in as rigorous a way as possible; subject these data to regular and comprehensive analysis; and use that analysis to locate the explanations or source of disparate outcomes. | The PBP and City of Pittsburgh provide current data that is searchable through the Burgh's Eye View application. | Implement the new RMS program that provides tracking capabilities for the statistics requested. This will provide an easier method to provide data and analysis, and a wealth of information that can be analyzed for specific trends, patterns, outcomes, as requested. | One Year |
| The PBP must commit itself to identifying all racial disparities in its routine actions; to requiring independent analysis of the data that show disparities, to identify the sources of these disparities, to account for them on either racial or other grounds; and for those that stem from race (i.e., for which no non-racial explanation is plausible) to creating specific plans to eliminate these disparities within one year, through changes in policy, practice, and actions. Plans for taking action to remedy these disparities shall be available to the public, including through publication on City and PBP websites. | Center for Police Equity completed and shared a report on the PBP regarding racial disparities using data from 2012-2017. | PBP to partner with Institute of Politics (IOP) to determine the root of racial disparites in policing. | 12 months from signing of MOU |
| The PBP must identify and ally with an independent partner – for example, a university, free-standing think tank, or a private analytics firm with a stellar history – to perform the analysis necessary to determine which disparities are based, in whole or in part, on race or other non-justifiable categories, and to pinpoint the source of those disparities, and to recommend changes to eliminate them. The City of Pittsburgh shall make appropriate funding necessary for this independent work on an ongoing basis for at least a period of five years. | PBP has explored a partnership with an independent partner to analyze data. | PBP to partner with IOP to determine the root of racial disparites in policing. Signing a MOU regarding information sharing and collaboration needs completed. | 1-2 months to complete MOU |
| The PBP must fill in the gaps in its data collection by routinely collecting data on the following police activities: | The City of Pittsburgh and PBP provide current data that is searchable through the Burgh's Eye View application. | With the implementation of the new RMS, reports can be added, generated, and manipulated as needed to meet these and any further requirements. | 1 year |
| Review any perceived population bias using the most recent American Community Survey five-year annual averages, not single-year Census population data. | The PBP currently uses US Government census data. |  |  |
| Collect and include in analysis and reports, data on pedestrian stops, uses of force beyond “come-along holds” and other low level uses, citations/warnings issued, summonses issued, and misdemeanor vs. felony arrests, broken out by race and gender. | The PBP currently tracks many types of use of force, and has recently added "pointing of a firearm" as a tracked use of force. Citations, summons, warnings, and arrests are already tracked by race and gender. |  | Complete |
| Require and include notation (by officers) and collection of data on reasons for traffic and pedestrian stops, arrests, and other police actions, including arrests by type of offense; specific factual basis for presence of probable cause and reasonable suspicion, when these standards are used for arrests, stops or searches, broken out by race and gender. | The PBP currently tracks reasons, probable cause, and reasonable suspicion for traffic stops, arrests, and searches, which can be broken out by race and gender. The other information is not currently collected in all circumstances. | With the implementation of the new RMS, reports can be added, generated, and manipulated as needed to meet these and any further requirements. | 1 year |
| Separate breakouts of stop, search and arrest data for black and white juveniles vs. black and white adults. | This data is currently partially collected, the data that is collected can be separated for review. | With the implementation of the new RMS, reports can be added, generated, and manipulated as needed to meet these and any further requirements. | 1 year |
| For all events that include searches (e.g., stops with frisks, arrests accompanied by searches, etc.), a calculation of the hit rate – the rate at which officers find contraband, the nature of contraband (e.g., illegal gun, cannabis, cocaine, etc.) and (if applicable) amount of contraband, with hit rates broken out by race and gender. | This data is currently partially collected, the data that is collected can be separated for review. | With the implementation of the new RMS, reports can be added, generated, and manipulated as needed to meet these and any further requirements. | 1 year |
| All data categories to include black/white relative risk or odds ratios for routine police actions. | This data is currently partially collected, the data that is collected can be separated for review. | With the implementation of the new RMS, reports can be added, generated, and manipulated as needed to meet these and any further requirements. | 1 year |
| Issue bi-monthly public reports assessing which PBP policies, programs, activities, tactics, or strategies are producing racial disparities, whether any non-racial explanations accounts for these disparities, and what is being done to remedy the situation. | PBP currently issues an Annual Report | PBP has engaged the IOP, RAND and RTI to further investigate the root of racial disparities in PBP activity. | 18 months from MOU with Institute of Politics (IOP). |
| Create new and modify existing programs to support a culture of community policing. | The PBP has implemented a Community Engagement Office (CEO), as well as Neighborhood Resource Officers (NRO) and Community Resource Officers (CRO), which meet this requirement. |  | Complete |
| Create a formal structure to establish and nurture a Community/Police Spiritual Leaders Council. The shared work of the police and the spiritual leaders will help strengthen partnership between community and police |  | The PBP CEO is currently working with community spiritual leaders to meet this goal. Currently restructuring the current Chaplaincy Program to more reflect the Pennsylvania State Police's program. | 6 months |

| Community/Police shared engagement in spirituality |  | The PBP CEO is currently working with community spiritual leaders to meet this goal. | 6 months |
| Provide as full an amount of information on internal police complaints and discipline as current law allows. At present, the data presented in the Annual Reports are skeletal and provide too little information for a member of the public to determine whether or not officers are being held accountable for actions that violate policy or lawosed, by type of misconduct. Report broken out by type of misconduct, the number of findings of exonerated, not resolved, sustained, or unfounded, disciplinary actions recommended, by which agency and by type of misconduct, and disciplinary actions imposed, by type of misconduct. For individual disciplinary complaints, the report must include, for each, a short narrative of the conduct alleged, the finding made by the investigating agency, if the disciplinary complaint is sustained, the disciplinary action recommended, and the disciplinary action actually imposed. There should also be a report that includes the number of incidents of officers terminated and permitted to return to duty with back pay. | PBP has purchased IA Pro software, which provides data reports, charts, and graphs of the information requested, as well as synopses of the complaints. This information can easily be added/provided to a front-facing dashboard. A discipline tracker is currently compiled, and is becoming a part of the PBP internal processes. This too can be provided in a front-facing dashboard. | Provide a front-facing dashboard with the requested information. Implement the IA Pro software and the Discipline Tracker and provide the information to a front-facing dashboard. This front facing dashboard would look to incorporate complaint information from the Office of Municipal Investigations and the Citizens Police Review Board. | 16 months |
| The PBP shall identify a partner for the construction of internal and public facing data platforms and dashboards to allow both PBP personnel at all levels and the public to understand and PBP activities, in as close to real time as is possible. This must include, at a minimum, an easily used public dashboard on routine enforcement activities that have shown racial disparities in the past, in order to monitor progress on improving these outcomes. | Crime Analysis has met with multiple parters to discuss creation of public dashboards, including Pittsburgh I&amp;P, the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center [WPRDC], as well as upcoming meetings with the mayor's office. Potential hosting platforms (ESRI, Power BI, new RMS) are being examined for feasibility. Complexity of some police data structure is a complicating factor, that will be impacted by new RMS. | Select the approprate partner and construct the public facing data platform. | 1 Year |

| Task Force Recommended Actions | Steps We Have Already Taken | Steps We Plan To Take | Anticipated Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reform hiring practices to ensure that law enforcement better reflects our Pittsburgh community in terms of culture, race and gender, and includes an extensive psychological assessment aimed at weeding out persons with aggressive personalities. These practices should include the examination of the ‘secondary qualifiers’, including the reading test, physical fitness test, polygraph examination, and research to discern the reasons for the gap between white, black and candidates of color. The hiring practices should also include conducting a full background check into the applicant’s former police job history: disciplinary action, complaints, and reasons for separation. These records should be maintained for a period of thirty (30) years, if not permanently. The City’s recruitment efforts should be continually assessed to measure their effectiveness. |  | PBP, Public Safety, HRCS, and Mayor's Office to review recruitment, qualifications, and hiring practices for prospectives officers. |  |
| Offer carefully selected and trained mentors to help retain all officers, particularly new female and minority officers, through their early careers. ‘Recruitment Coaches’ who are identified could help navigate cadet candidates through the secondary qualifiers. These individuals could come from members of the community who have a commitment to having a more diverse police force, including former and retired police officers, who have a vested interest in developing a guardian mindset in police candidates, and who are committed to getting these individuals through the process to reach the end goal of becoming a Pittsburgh police officer. Existing officers, particularly those who have lived in the community for a number of years, should be encouraged to recruit and recommend candidates for the Police Academy. |  | The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives(N.O.B.L.E.) has developed a program at California University that mentors individuals interested in pursuing a career in law enforcement. This NOBLE Collegiate Chapter is planning on partnering with the PBP to include mentoring, shadowing, and internships. The Police Ambassador Program, is a paid program that focuses on 5 key points (Diversity, Community Relations, Leadership Development, Mentorship, and Meaningful Experience). The goal of each of these programs is to help motivate and support individuals through the hiring process of becoming a Police Officer. | 1 year |
| Recruit officers who display a "guardian mindset" in their approach to community policing. As President Obama's Taskforce on 21st Century Policing noted: “Law enforcement cannot build community trust if it is seen as an occupying force coming in from outside to rule and control the community. As Plato wrote, 'In a republic that honors the core of democracy—the greatest amount of power is given to those called Guardians. Only those with the most impeccable character are chosen to bear the responsibility of protecting the democracy.”This guardian approach should be reinforced through ongoing training throughout an officer's career. | The PBP has adopted the guardian mindset and is working to develop and facilitate training to establish congruent mindset training for Officers that further develops proper response actions based on when each mindset model and when each mindset is necessary and appropriate. | The PBP is working to establish training criteria to further develop the guardian mindset congruent with 21st century policing models, while ensuring Officer and citizen safety, and establishing evolving state of the art police practices and procedures. | 1 year |
| Expanding the PA Confidence in Law Enforcement Act to require termination for misconduct that is other than a felony. This would require legislative amendments |  | Changes to the PA Confidence in Law Enforcement Act would require State / legislative advocacy / action. |  |
| Adopt and implement the Citizen Police Review Board (CPRB) recommendations contained in the in-depth redacted version accepted by the Recruitment subcommittee, (CPRB) Recommendations, and consider adopting the opinion of the Ongoing Training &amp; Professional Development - Full Recommendations from the Recruitment, Hiring, Training, Education Subcommittee CPRB whose research indicates that the 60 college credit requirement does not adversely affect the recruitment of women or minorities, and should be retained to help increase the professionalism of the force. There must be extraordinary and innovative efforts to significantly increase the percentage of blacks and women on the Pittsburgh police force, such as devising a strong marketing campaign, supporting participation in the Civilian Police Academy, the Student Police Academy, and expanding the criminal justice program in the Pittsburgh Public Schools to attract more African American candidates. To enhance the potential for the recruitment of additional African Americans, all oral panels for the Bureau must include not less than one citizen, and should contain at least one African American. |  | The PBP has implemented a new position for Recruitment at the PBP Training Academy. This position will work to meet these mandates. | 1 Year |

| Adopt the CPRB recommendation that academy training include mental conditioning, stress avoidance and reduction, integration and recognition of stress effects, with the preventative principles of stress management and practical experience. Academy training should be presented by a professional health care practitioner specializing in the psychophysiological processes related to stress conditions, and it should be required annually and applicable to the entire organization. | The PBP Training Academy currently provides training in mental conditioning, stress avoidance and reduction, and other related areas. | The PBP should seek out and partner with an instructor who is a professional health care practitioner who meets this criteria.

| Create a culture within PBP that fosters an ongoing commitment to the spirit and meaning of ‘community policing’. This goal would include requiring that officers be trained annually, with ongoing reinforcement in cultural competency, de-escalation and harm-reduction techniques and providing cultural competency training by experts in African American culture as well as those who can represent the interest of other marginalized communities. Additional cultural competency training may also include experts from as the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History; mandating training on racial, religious, and discriminatory profiling for all law enforcement; requiring training of all officers for proper use of body cameras during all calls, which would include requiring body cameras to be left on during any interaction with the public. A police officer that does not adhere to this requirement should receive some level of discipline that is severe enough to help ensure compliance. | The PBP Training Academy provides training in community policing, de-escalation and harm reduction, the Inside-Out program, the illegalities of profiling, and body-camera usage and policy. The PBP does discipline officers who fail to use their body cameras within policy(PDF, 532KB) | The PBP Training Academy is working to expand the curriculum to meet the remainder of these requirements. Community feedback forums on community training impact are supported to measure the practice of the training in the field. | 1 year |
| Train officers to move from exclusively crime fighting to encompass other service-oriented functions and to be trained to recognize the characteristics of individuals in crisis to provide an effective positive resolution to the situation while reducing liability and the risk of injury. The various types of de-escalation practices suggested by this Recruitment subcommittee should be adopted by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police within the training component of the Police Academy, and for the necessary ongoing training of its officers, if not already contained within the City’s training program. The goal for all officers is to be in command of as many de-escalation techniques as possible which will allow them to be well equipped to secure the scene at hand, to calmly communicate with the citizens involved and to produce positive outcomes. Training must always emphasize that the use of force should never be considered routine and that utmost restraint should always be used, always respecting the sanctity of all human life. Training should also emphasize that all attempts should be made to gain compliance of the subject through less-lethal means. | The PBP Training Academy has expanded its curriculum to meet these requirements prior to the reccomendations of this report. | Continue to instruct on the curriculum provided by the PBP Training Academy so that Officers receive this training on a regular basis. Recognition and praise for consistant de-escalation efforts as well as character development will be highlighted in organizational communication. | Complete |
| The Police Academy should calibrate its training with the City offices that track the diversity of languages spoken by residents of Pittsburgh.The intent is to provide cadets with a basic multi-cultural awareness to understand languages other than English spoken to police officers.All police officers should carry an annually updated pocket card of the following statement in multiple languages, “I am a police officer.Please follow my visual instructions to make sure that no one gets hurt. I am here to help you.” | PBP Officers have access to a Language Line service that can provide real time, on demand interpretation of any language spoken. PBP maintains a list of active officers that are fluent in non-english languages. PBP has a language card to facilitate the identification of languages spoken by indiviudals during police interactions. | PBP Training Academy to explore inservice training for common phrases for languages spoken withing the region. | 12 months |
| Train police to understand people’s limits and inabilities to process and understand police commands, particularly people with disabilities, mentally ill, and medical emergencies. This process should include at least yearly refresher courses, including role playing workshops. | The PBP Training Academy currently provides the recommended training, however not on a yearly basis. The Training Academy will attempt to incorporate this training into yearly inservice training. | Local disability support organizations will be invited to join collaborative learning and practice sessions to reinforce training application | 1 year |
| Create policies against participation in discriminatory and hate speech, or supporting such viewpoints publicly or on social media. The taskforce understands that such policies may only pertain to on-duty conduct; however, the PBP can and must periodically review officers’ personal or off-duty speech, particularly on social media. This review can help the PBP identify any conduct that may affect officers’ on-duty performance. Once identified, the PBP can monitor officer interactions, up to and including arrests, so that it may intervene appropriately when it determines that conduct approaches or becomes harassment, discriminatory, or excessive in the use of force. | The PBP has issued policy 68-03 which meets these requirements. Officers on-duty performance is reviewed based on violations of policy 68-03(PDF, 192KB) |  | Complete |
| Create a policy that requires police body cams, and police car videos be activated immediately when interacting with people as a result of a police call or suspected necessary police intervention, as well enacting policies which mandate that police report other police who violate police policies. These policies and procedures must be shared, in depth, during the initial training of new police cadets, and must be reinforced on at least an annual basis, if not an ongoing basis. The PBP must be consistent in its issuance of discipline for violations of this policy. | The PBP has policies which covers this mandate and meets many of the requirments. These policies are General Orders 69-01 and 69-03. 69-01 is available via this link.(PDF, 158KB) | Both General Order 69-01 and 69-03 are under review. 69-03 is available via this link.(PDF, 532KB) | Complete |
| Commit to have new cadets and all members of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police complete the Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Gender Expression (SOGIE) training. There should be a ‘refresher’ course provided to all officers on an annual basis. Training should include sensitizing officers on how to most appropriately interact with people who are, or who are perceived to be, LGBTQIA+, and training which includes the most effective ways to counter attitudes that a police officer may already possess when encountering people who they may already view in a very negative fashion. The PBP must be consistent in its issuance of discipline for discriminatory behavior based on gender identity or expression. | The PBP Training Academy currently provides the recommended training to recruits. | The Training Academy will attempt to incorporate this into annual inservice training. | 1 year |

| Expand the Youth Connections initiative developed within the last five years, and create more community-based opportunities with such groups as the YMCA, YWCA, grass roots organizations, religious institutions, and the Pittsburgh Public Schools, where coursework on and for policing can be made more accessible to the public. Steps should be taken to actively expand the already existing community interactions through such programs as Big Brother/Big Sister programs, Cops and Hoops, and the Police Athletic League (PAL). | PBP applied for grant funding to expand this program. | Once the funding is confirmed, all PBP officers will be considered for participation with broader youth oriented activities and commitments. | 1 year |
| Train police officers in their informal interactions with community members to build more positive ongoing relationships between neighborhood residents and the police. Officers should be instructed on better interactions with citizens as they begin to walk their neighborhoods to build nurturing and healthy relationships. Organize programs which bring new officers and community leaders together in a ‘meet and greet’ program, to encourage the officers to accept that leaders frequently know what is best for their community, and/or how they can best work together for the benefit of all.“Community Policing” should be used as the philosophy for daily operations of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. Training should encourage every officer to be community minded, compassionate and empathetic. Community engagement can include career fairs at which HR and police representatives will interact with adults about career opportunities, while other public safety staff interact with the youth through the use of McGruff the Dog, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances, etc. | The PBP has implemented these recomendations. This begins in the Training Academy with training on Community Oriented Policing. It has expanded to include "meet-and-greet" sessions for new officers in several Zones. The Community Engagement Office is focused on following through with many of these projects. |  | Complete |
| City should employ a full time liaison who will work with the community and the police to create and promote positive relationships. | The City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Public Safety has created the Office of Community Health and Safety within the Bureau of Public Safety.

| Produce an annual public operational profile, which describes internal and external outcomes of the PBP. This document should profile the nature, outcomes and number of disciplinary actions taken, disciplinary grievances and arbitration, demotions and separations, commendations and promotions, and the educational levels of active officers. It should also indicate the number of calls responded to the incidence of officers’ use of force, arrests and conviction rates. This document of transparency would serve to influence public confidence, as well as offer prospective applicants information to evaluate personal career choices within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. |  | The PBP Currently issues an Annual Report. Further information can be included in the PBP Annual Report to meet this recommendation. A discipline tracker is currently being compiled, and is becoming a part of the PBP internal processes.

| Increased diversity in the selection of arbitrators to include people of various ages, more women and more people of color | The City of Pittsburgh and FOP currently utilize the National Association of Arbitrators when selecting an arbitrator. This association has a selection process in place that allows input and objections from both parties to maintain fairness during selection. | Changes would require State / legislative advocacy / action. |  |
| The Municipal Police Officers Education and Training Commission (MPOETC) is the licensing body of PBP officers, and it sets standards for licensing police officers. It should exercise its authority to revoke licenses for certain types of misconduct more frequently. Also, diversification of the commission will be important for that as its members are largely members of law enforcement, and it includes only one member of the public at large. This would require legislative amendments to PA Act 120 | The PBP has a good working relationship with MPOETC. The department maintains open and frequent communication with MPOETC when an officer is charged or potentially being charged with a criminal offense. | Changes regarding MPOETC would require State / legislative advocacy / action. |  |

| Implement an officer bystander intervention program like EPIC to build a culture of zero tolerance for inappropriate use of force. |  | The PBP Training Academy is researching the implementation of such a program. | 1 Year |
| Some members of the community do not understand and/or trust the functioning of the Office of Municipal Investigations and the Citizen Police Review Boards. It is recommended that both offices take steps to establish a stronger connection to the public to explain how they operate and to translate data about why so few complaints regarding officer misconduct are sustained. This may be achieved by adding one or more community liaison to the Citizen Police Review Board and by extending the authority of the CPRB to investigate complaints. | In the summer of 2019, OMI hired an intern to update our printed material and write a script for an OMI infomercial. OMI has worked with HR and Special Events to attend and table at community events and job fairs. Staff is available to provide printed materials describing our purpose, process and how we differ from the CPRB. In 2019, OMI attended 7 events (Hill District, Brighton Heights, Point Breeze, etc.) OMI staff routinely presents at both the Civic Leadership Academy and Citizen Police Academy. | OMI's printed materials are updated and available. The infomercial has been filmed, but needs final edits before being added to City Channel. OMI will continue to attend community events once in person events begin, post-pandemic. CLA and CPA have continued virtually. | 2nd Qtr 2021 |
| The new Office of Community Health and Safety may play a role in developing more transparency regarding complaints against the PBP, particularly now that this Office has oversight of the policing of protests. | This recommendation is outside the direct scope of OCHS. This is currently being handled by the CPRB and OMI. | The OCHS will be responsible for identifying and developing partnerships and internal response continuum. |  |
| Provide the community with more and better explanations around why the majority of complaints against officers are unfounded, not resolved and exonerated. | PBP has purchased IA Pro software, which provides data reports, charts, and graphs of the information requested, as well as a synopsis of the complaints.

| Reduce the number of officers who have been charged with or exhibit consistent patterns of misconduct who return to PBP. | The PBP has a disciplinary process in place per the current Collective Bargaining Agreement. This process involves all parties presenting to a neutral abitrator. |  |  |
| Expand, revitalize, and fully implement use of the Personnel Assessment and Review System (PARS), or replace PARS with another early warning system, either alternative to meet current state of the art and best practice standards. Early warning systems assist police agencies in identifying potentially problematic police officers and behaviors and focus the agency on finding remedies (counseling, re-training, etc.) before these problems cause damage to the public and/or the agency. | PBP has purchased IA Pro software, which provides data reports, charts, and graphs of the information requested, as well as a synopsis of the complaints. Part of the IA Pro software package is EI Pro, which is an early warning system that is superior to the PARS system. | Implement technology that reduces the amount of time supervisors spend in redundant bureaucratic tasks to allow for more time spend where the supervisor is most significantly impactful - on the street in the communities with the officers. | 6 months |

This process involves all parties presenting to a neutral abitrator. |  |  |
| The community cannot establish trust with the police department without positive interactions and better mutual understanding of their work. To help build community trust, the PBP should implement forums or community meetings at which PBP can present information and hear citizen concerns and suggestions. Simply publishing an annual report is not enough. These community forums should especially seek to engage racial minorities, people with disabilities, immigrant communities, youth, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community as well as leaders in these historically marginalized communities. |  | The City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Public Safety has created the Office of Community Health and Safety within the Bureau of Public Safety. The PBP has also created the CEO staffed with full-time Officers who can work to meet this recomendation. | 6 months |
Internal Culture(show below)
It is the culture of any organization that largely determines its direction, its internal ethics, and its interactions with the people that it serves. This is the case as much with police agencies as any other kind of organization, and the PBP is no exception. The taskforce believes that the internal culture of the PBP is just as important as any set of rules or policies PBP officers must follow, if not more so. In that spirit, the taskforce recommends the following efforts.

| The PBP must reject the Warrior culture of policing, prominent in many police organizations, and fully embrace the Guardian policing mindset in order to build trust and legitimacy with the public. Mayor Peduto recommended this shift in his opening remarks charging the taskforce at its first meeting, and we agree that this should be a high priority. Warrior policing is characterized by choosing their own side, dehumanizing others as enemies, and acting on instinct. Guardian policing, by contrast, chooses the law, sees people as distinct individuals, and acts in deliberate, thoughtful fashion whenever possible. A pledge to keep procedural justice at the center of policy, training and action throughout the PBP will go a long way toward the Guardian mindset; the first-rank procedural justice training that PBP officers have received should be continued and reinforced | The PBP has adopted the guardian mindset and is working to develop and facilitate training to establish congruent mindset training for Officers that further develops proper response actions based on when each mindset model and when each mindset is necessary and appropriate. Education on warrior minset and proper application, while eliminating the culture of the police at war with its citizens, is the driving force to cultural change and police mindset training methodologies in order to promote the proper mindset response to emerging situations. | The PBP is working to establish training criteria to further develop the guardian mindset congruent with 21st century policing models, while ensuring Officer and citizen safety, and establishing evolving state of the art police practices and procedures. Develop taskforce groups to address emerging criminal activity with a comprehensive strategic approach that include eliminating the criminal element while engaging the community as partners in the on going mission to deliver justice and promote a safe community. This methodology will take both strategic vision by command, implementation through training and eduction, along with supervison to ensure the objectives of the executive management strategy. The development and implementation of this executive managment strategy will take the engagement of the community, robust and active participation by command for he success of this particular reform. | 1 year |
| Racial reconciliation efforts, begun in late 2018, must be re-energized, reconstituted, and be brought front and center for the PBP. Racial reconciliation was one of the three main pillars of the National Initiative to Create Community Trust and Justice. Pittsburgh was one of the six pilot sites for the National Initiative, and the PBP began its efforts on this pillar with a large event at the Heinz History Center on November 13, 2018. A small number of follow up events followed. These efforts must be renewed with a new vigor. Successful police change requires beginning with a full acknowledgment of the role of police in racial injustices past and present. While many current officers have had no role in present injustices, and none in the mistakes of the past in which police were the enforcement arm for vile laws and customs, they wear the same patch and uniform of the enforcers of those laws and practices. In order for African Americans and those others subject to these unjust actions to regain and build trust with the PBP, the effort to apologize for and admit prior mistakes must be full throated and sincere. |  | The PBP remains steadfast in our commitment to the work we started with the National Initiative (NI). Starting with the next recruit class there will be a 4-hour training block on 21st Century Policing, NI overview, and reconciliation added to the curriculum. The PBP is a leader in Procedural Justice training and has collaborated with the Allegheny County Police to teach PJ and Implicit Bias at the Allegheny County Police Academy so all police agencies have access to the class. Finally, The PBP is working with David Harris to develop a class for basic recruits. | On-going |
| The PBP must, at every turn, pledge its intolerance for misconduct by officers, and the public must see and understand that this commitment is and will be carried out. The taskforce heard from many members of the public that they were aware of incidents of misconduct by PBP officers, in which the officers were not disciplined or terminated. No member of the taskforce believes that every incident of misconduct is a firing offense or should result in criminal charges. But the public has no way at this point to know what happens to these incidents or why when they are the subject of complaints, and also sees plainly that some well-known and seemingly blatant incidents of misconduct go unaddressed. The failure to communicate enough information about misconduct and resulting discipline, and the failure to impose discipline that even approaches what is appropriate, damages public trust and confidence of the public in the police. | PBP has purchased IA Pro software, which provides data reports, charts, and graphs of the information requested, as well as a synopsis of the complaints. This information can easily be added/provided to a front-facing dashboard. A discipline tracker is currently compiled, and is becoming a part of the PBP internal processes.

| PBP policy must require reporting of all use of force, including threats using firearms. | This is contained within PBP Policy 12-6, and taught at the PBP Training Academy |  | Complete |
| Narrow the justification for use of deadly force in PBP policy section 5.0. |  |  |  |
| Amend section 5.1.1 to read, “The action is immediately necessary for the defense of human life…” Amend sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.1.2 to read that “In order to use deadly force, that action must be not only reasonable but necessary a) to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm against the officer or another person; or b) to apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in death or serious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended.The current core of the PBP’s use of force policy (see Section 5 of that policy) follows current Pennsylvania and U.S. constitutional law very closely. Those are minimum legal standards that allow more discretion and use of force justifications, and give less protection to citizens from force, than taskforce members believe is wise. The changes in this recommendation would effectively raise the standard above that Pennsylvania/constitutional minimum; they parallel a use of force law passed in California in 2019 | The PBP's current policy (12-06) regarding use of force , specifically deadly force, currently follows such guidlines. The PBP restricts the use of deadly force to circumstances permitted under state and federal law.. This policy was revised January 5, 2021. |  | Complete |
| Prohibit use of deadly force against anyone who poses a danger only to themselves, including those who are sight- or hearing-impaired, otherwise disabled, or suffering from mental illness |  | Officers should take into consideration the reason for a person's non-compliance (medical issue, EDP, language barrier), this will be further discussed in 2021 Use of Force training. Just because someone is displaying signs of EDP, mental illness, etc, does not mean an Officer should not use force on said person (depending on the totality of the circumstance) The PBP restricts the use of deadly force to circumstances permitted under state and federal law. The PBP restricts the use of deadly force to circumstances permitted under state and federal law. | On-going |
| Transparency on use of force must be the rule. |  | The PBP is in the process of creating an online dashboard to assist in early detection of use of force issues and to make use of force statistics more accessible to the public. The city has also called on Harrisburg to change state law to create better transparency in regards to use of force. | 1 Year |
| PBP officers must be trained to utilize distance, cover and time to decrease the necessity for the use of force. To minimize the need for uses of force, especially force that could injure or kill, PBP must develop policy and training mandating the use of physical distance, cover, and time when approaching and managing certain critical incidents, especially incidents involving edged weapons. When officers can make themselves temporarily safe by maintaining distance and cover from immediate danger, they can buy more time to assess the situation and their options, bring additional resources to the scene, and develop a plan for resolving the incident without the use of force or with only the force necessary to mitigate the threat. | The current training provided by the Training Academy meets this standard. | Officers are taught to de-escalate situations when it is safe for them to do so (the officer has time, distance, and cover, as well as no 3rd parties are in harm's way).Officer are trained to use de-escalation tools and tactics when they can SAFELY do so. In addition to use of force training/de-escalation techniques, the Training Academy puts a lot of emphasis on solid patrol tactics, the crux of this is to teach the officers to recognize when they can slow the action down versus immediate action. | Complete |
| PBP should eliminate from their policies and training all references to the so-called “21-foot rule” regarding officers who are confronted with a subject armed with an edged weapon, if any such references exist, as this standard is unfounded. Instead, officers should be trained to use distance and cover to create a “reaction gap,” or “safe zone,” between themselves and the individual, and to consider all options for responding. | The PBP traininig academy does not currently teach the "21 foot rule" but rather emphasizes threat proximity, knowledge of your surroundings and understanding reactionary gaps. |  | Complete |
| To protect a person with a disability from police use of force, training for police must equip officers to understand a person with a disability limits and issues in understanding and responding to police commands or questions. When encountering people who officers believe to be disabled or suffering from mental illness, officers will immediately summon a trained professional to assess the situation. |  | Officers should take into consideration the reason for a person's non-compliance (medical issue, EDP, language barrier), this will be further discussed in 2021 Use of Force training. Just because someone is displaying signs of EDP, mental illness, etc, does not mean an officer should not use force on said person (depending on the totality of the circumstance).

| The use of tear gas, rubber bullets, flash-bang devices, pepper spray, “bean bag” rounds, and other “less-lethal” weapons typically used by the PBP for crowd control must be significantly curtailed and used only in life-threatening situations until such time as the next steps below are carried out and completed.If the independent organization described below does not formulate viable recommendations and issue a public report within six months of its formation, a moratorium will go into effect on using the PBP tactics described above. Such moratorium will remain in effect until such time as the independent organization completes its work | Chief Scott Schubert is co-chair of the Major City Chiefs Association working group on police response to civil unrest. | This is currently being investigated by OMI and the CPRB. Most recently a private, independant consultant has been brought in to look further into these events. |  |
| The City of Pittsburgh will act to immediately bring in an independent organization, one not affiliated with law enforcement in Western Pennsylvania, to generate recommendations and a report for the following purpose: |  | This is currently happening, and the investigation prior to the report is occurring | 6 months |
| 1. Investigating the use of tear gas and all other “less-lethal” weapons in the demonstrations of late May and early June of 2020, as well as the use of kettling (the purpose of the investigation, will not include the investigation of individual officers for their actions, but only the actions of the PBP as an agency, with any investigations of individuals to be carried out by the PBP, OMI, the CPRB, or by other agencies with applicable jurisdiction; |  | This is currently happening, and the investigation prior to the report is occurring. | 6 months |
| 2. Reviewing the current policies, procedures and training of the PBP for use of all of these weapons, to see whether or not these conform with current industry standards and best practices; |  | This is currently happening, and the investigation prior to the report is occurring. | 6 months |
| 3. Making recommendations for how any of the PBP’s policies, procedures, and training must change conform to come up to industry standards and best practices; |  | This is currently happening, and the investigation prior to the report is occurring. | 6 months |
| 4. The publication of a report on these items to be made public. To the extent that the report advises banning any particular crowd control device or tool, it will be banned. |  | This is currently happening, and the investigation prior to the report is occurring. | 6 months |
| The use of “kettling” or other tactics designed to contain or trap protesters must end. Kettling is a crowd-control technique used by the police. Also known as "trap and detain,” police use this tactic to surround protesters in a confined space so they cannot leave and cannot obey orders to disperse. Once police block people from getting out, failure to disperse may be used as a pretext for arrest. Use of this tactic in this fashion may allow police to assert control, but it also enhances the danger of violence and subjects protesters who would otherwise leave peacefully to arrest. A tactic with these downsides must be confined to the few situations in which it might be used to calm and defuse violence, not to escalate it or create new criminal charges and more resentment of police actions. If it cannot be limited to such situations through a defined policy (pursuant to the independent organization’s investigation -- see Fourth recommendation, below) that does not allow its use against protesters not using violence, it must cease. | The PBP does not utlizie "Kettling" techniques or tactics. |  | Complete |
| The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) will revise its policies and procedures to reflect the findings of the independent investigation, and to revamp its training to reflect these new policies and procedures. |  | This is currently happening, and the investigation prior to the report is occurring. | 6 months |
| All PBP officers, starting with command staff, will be retrained on these new policies with said revamped training. No officer at any level who has not been retrained will be deployed to any situation during which crowd control devices may need to be used. |  | The PBP will work on implementation after the report comes out, and polices are amended/adjusted as needed. | 1 year |
| New policies will be reviewed annually. | The PBP currently reviews ALL policies every two years. | The PBP will take under advisement the review of policies on an annual basis, rather than biannually. |
