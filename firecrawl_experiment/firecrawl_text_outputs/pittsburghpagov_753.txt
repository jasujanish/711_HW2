Who's My Neighborhood Planner?
Neighborhood planners act as liaisons between the City and the community for most planning processes. Neighborhood planners participate in and often coordinate community plans. This group of planners act as go-to people for explanations of zoning, development, transportation, and other planning-related matters. Whether you're an individual or a representative of a community organization, neighborhood planners are here to help.
