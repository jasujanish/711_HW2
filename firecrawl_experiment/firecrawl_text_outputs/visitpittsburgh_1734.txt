Game Day Bars in Pittsburgh
One of the best sports cities in the nation has some great sports bars to go along with their teams!
From tailgates to office potlucks to spirit days and the Steelers chant, there is no doubt that football season is one of the most anticipated seasons of the year. Steelers fans come from every edge of the country just to get a piece of the action, and who can blame them? Steelers games are an experience like no other and, without a doubt, are one of the most highly coveted sporting events in the city to attend; those with tickets have often had them for generations, and the rest of us are left fighting over what’s left.
Good news, though: You don’t have to be live to love the game. What’s more: Even if you don’t have tickets, Steeler Nation will make every bar and restaurant in every neighborhood on Game Day feel as though you are sitting in Acrisure Stadium.
Whether you want to hit the bar to catch one of our black and gold teams, or any other sporting event, we have some great spots around the city for you. Check out our top 13 picks for where to watch the game:

1. Piper's Pub
Footie fans, rejoice. Piper's Pub reopened early in 2023 to the delight of soccer fans in the Burgh.

Rugby fans: check out Rugger's Pub in this same neighborhood for your sports fix along with Pirates and Steelers game specials.

2. Mario’s Southside Saloon
A Pittsburgh favorite, Mario’s was brought to life in 1982 by Pittsburgh native Bob Pessolano, who created a bar that has a unique blend of a neighborhood, college and sports bar rolled into one. A popular Southside game-time destination, you can also find a Mario’s in Oakland and Shadyside.

3. Carson City Saloon
The self-proclaimed “#1 sports bar in Pittsburgh” is in the heart of Southside. With three floors to find the perfect spot to camp out and watch the game, it’s no wonder that Carson City is so popular among the natives. With a menu full of game-time staples and specials every day of the week, Carson City is worth a stop.

Unassuming, Cupka's Café II offers a nostalgic sports bar atmosphere.

Not only is Cupka's Café II a welcoming environment for you, but your dog is welcome to join you on the outdoor seating patios.

5. Voodoo Brewing Co. - Pittsburgh Pub
You love their Homestead location, and now Voodoo's newest location (right next to Shorty's) makes it the perfect place to grab a beer before or after the game. All of Voodoo's favorites are on tap and available in cans, plus their gigantic menu is a mix of pub favorites and upscale Asian fusion noodle bowls and South American entrees to please any palate.
6. Tom's Watch Bar
All sports, all the time is the promise of Tom's Watch Bar, just opened in Aug. 2023 between PNC Park and Acrisure Stadium. Hundreds of screens provide a great view of the action no matter where you sit, with personalized audio at each table and sports shown from the biggest events to the most obscure sports.

Shadyside
10. William Penn Tavern
A Shadyside staple located off of Walnut Street, the William Penn Tavern, or just “The Tav,” is a great place to watch a game whatever day or time it is. With a “hometown bar” vibe, a kitchen that’s open until midnight each night and an indoor/outdoor bar, there isn’t a better place to join your friends.

12. Primanti Bros.
With locations throughout Pittsburgh, you're never far from this famous restaurant where the fries go on the sandwiches. A Pittsburgh classic, it's not a trip to the 'Burgh without a trip to a Primantis. Choose from locations in Downtown, South Side, Oakland, The Strip District and more! Yinz may even start talking Pittsburghese after this formative 'Burgh experience.

13. City Works
90 craft beers showcasing 30+ local breweries, gigantic televisions covering every surface and state-of-the-art audio so you never miss a call. Has one of the best brunch menus in the city if you're watching an earlier game and fantastic sharable flatbreads and appetizes making this a perfect spot to host your fantasy draft party. Yeah, this place kinda has it all.
