Spray Parks
Spray Parks & Playgrounds With Spray Features Open for the Season on Saturday, May 24, 2025!
You do not need swimming skills to enjoy our spray parks. Spray parks are accessible to the tiniest toddler to a pre-teen adventurer, and even those using wheelchairs.
Let your imagination run wild, as sensors cause sprayers to magically turn on and off in this three-dimensional world of water. It's guaranteed to bring back memories of running through sprinklers, but this time with a lot more fun, color and movement.
2025 Spray Park Hours of Operation (Weather Permitting)
Spray Parks will remain open through September 21, 2025 (weather permitting).
10 AM to 8 PM Daily
Note:  The Beechview Spray Park is closed until further notice.  This closure is due to a mechanical issue.  Stay tuned for updates.
