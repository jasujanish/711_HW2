Sound Series: Rafiq Bhatia with special guest Morgan Stewart
Tuesday, October 7, 2025, 8 p.m.
We welcome back composer, producer, and guitarist, Rafiq Bhatia (member of Son Lux) in a trio configuration with fellow Son Lux member Ian Chang and Riley Mulherkar, as part of a tour supporting his latest album Environments on Anti Records. Following up on Bhatia’s three previous Sound Series performances, most recently in 2019 with his Breaking English album and two appearances as guitarist with Son Lux, with whom he earned Oscar and BAFTA nominations for their Everything Everywhere All At Once score, Bhatia continues to explore the genre boundaries with his inventive guitar textures. According to the BBC, “[Bhatia’s] music manages to marry the busyness and vibrancy of jazz and the sparseness and sparkle of electronic music.” And according to The Wire, “Rafiq Bhatia evokes various interweaving ecosystems on Environments with confidence, gratitude and grace… devastatingly expressive and intricate.” Also a prolific collaborator, Bhatia has also worked with a wide range of artists including David Byrne, André Benjamin, Mitski and Kronos Quartet. Pittsburgh-based ambient musician Morgan Stewart opens the evening with a new body of work—impressionistic and minimal, rich in texture and tonal nuance. Abstracting traditional structure, she weaves layered voice and sound into slow-burning compositions that feel both intimate and expansive.
Doors open at 7 p.m.
Co-presented with Telegraph Tree
