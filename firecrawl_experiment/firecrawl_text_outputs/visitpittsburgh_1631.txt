How difficult is an escape room?
Escape rooms often list their level of difficulty in their description. You can also request clues from the host throughout the game. Keep in mind, the more players you have with you, the easier the game will be.
Are there cameras in an escape room?
Yes, for your safety and to help you in case you need a clue, there are cameras in escape rooms.
What happens if you don’t escape in time?
The doors will open, and the host will come in. Depending on the location, they will then guide you through the steps to complete the escape. Note that if they show you how to finish the game, you will likely not be able to book that room again in the future.
