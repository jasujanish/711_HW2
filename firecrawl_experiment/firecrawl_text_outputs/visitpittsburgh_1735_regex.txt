Here's My Story
When I moved from Eastern Pennsylvania to the great city of Pittsburgh in the summer of 2022, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. While I chose the University of Pittsburgh for its vibrant location, surrounded by a plethora of UPMC locations–as an aspiring healthcare provider–I was skeptical as to whether the music scene would live up to my expectations.
As a high school student, music consumed my entire life. Jazz Band, Symphony Orchestra, Marching Band, Pit Orchestra, and honors ensembles filled my calendar each week, convincing me there was no better place to be than with my French Horn at my average-sized public high school. However, I was wrong. Since attending Pitt, I’ve been enriched with a multitude of musical opportunities I couldn’t have dreamed of, including Pitt’s very own Varsity Marching Band.
Within this guide are my personal recommendations, both experienced and non, for music in Pittsburgh to give you the best possible experience while you’re here. Listed under each are instructions on how to get to and from, and the prices for each– a college student’s must-know.

Exposition
Pittsburgh’s jazz scene is nothing short of exceptional. Pittsburgh, due to its convenient location between New York and Chicago, brought along a wave of jazz during the 1920’s, deeming its very own Hill District as “Little Harlem.”
The iconic Crawford Grille in the Hill District, opened in 1950, quickly gained state and national attention as a place where black and white musicians could make music together, attracting jazz greats such as Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. Here are some places in Pittsburgh that offer live jazz music, accessible for students and families.
Con Alma
Con Alma blends live jazz with Latin American cuisine. It’s a popular spot for jazz lovers and foodies alike, offering an immersive cultural experience almost every night.

Recapitulation
As we near the end of our musical journey, we get to the stringent recapitulation that is – benefits and performances students have access to. As a student at the University of Pittsburgh, here’s a rundown of everything music related we as students (at Pitt) have access to.
Varsity Marching Band
Students can receive discounted season passes to home games at Acrisure Stadium to watch the Pitt Football Team with a side of marching band at halftime. The energy is electric on game day, and if we win, the “victory lights” beam from the top of the Cathedral of Learning – a truly special feeling. As a member of the band there’s nothing like playing with 200+ other members to a filled stadium.
