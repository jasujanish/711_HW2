Nightlife in Pittsburgh
The fun doesn't stop in Pittsburgh just because the sun goes down
A night out in Downtown Pittsburgh doesn't have to end at 10 p.m. There are floors to be danced on, drinks to sip and memories to be made until the wee hours.
If you're in town for the night and looking to cut loose, dance until you drop and see some great live performances, Pittsburgh has you covered. Here are some of our current favorite Pittsburgh venues open past midnight that you'll be telling all your friends about over lots of coffee the next day.
Howl at the Moon
Open until 2 a.m. Thursday – Saturday
Ready to get loud? For a night with a little more energy, Howl at the Moon is sure to get the party started. The bar area will provide you with bucket cocktails like Howlin' Punch, Hot Girl Summer and Fruit Roll Up while the stage showcases live music and dueling pianos to keep you singing and dancing along all night.
Howl at the Moon is also a great spot to plan private parties like bachelor or bachelorette parties, birthdays and holiday parties. Keep a close eye on their schedule, too, for special events throughout the year including Red, White &amp; Brew, Emo Night, 90's Night and much more.

Social House 7
Open until 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday
Social House 7 not only serves up savory Japanese fusion in sharable, tapas-style plates, but it also has a trendy vibe to dress up and go all out for a late night party. Their location in the Pittsburgh Cultural District also makes it a great stop for dinner before a show and drinks after when the late-night atmosphere is in full swing. Be sure to capture you and your besties' looks in front of the pink blooms adorning their flower wall or under the cherry blossoms overhead.

Cavo
Open until 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday
If you're looking to spread your night just a little further beyond Downtown, find Cavo in the Strip District. This chic night club will keep you dancing and having fun all night. Cavo has three rooms, two dance floors, a bar area with lounge seating, DJs and live music plus a VIP balcony with bottle service, for those of you trying to avoid paparazzi.
Cavo is a great place to go if you love getting dressed up and experiencing a big city style night of dancing and fun.

Shorty's Pins x Pints
Open until 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday
Shorty's on the North Shore keeps the party going into the wee hours while catering to night owls of all types. You can go duckpin bowling with your friends (complete with a sassy scoreboard ridiculing your throws), challenge your friends to a game of Street Fighter, drink from a stellar cocktail and beer list, or just grab a board game and play Uno until last call. Truly one of my favorite late night spots that any group of friends can enjoy.
Tequila Cowboy
Open until 2 a.m. Wednesday-Sunday
Tequila Cowboy on the North Shore plays both types of music (country and western)! Blame it all on your roots and show up in boots to dance to live music on their main stage, take center stage at WannaB's Karaoke Bar then change it up at Little Red Corvette for 80's &amp; 90's favorites. Big screen TVs make this a perfect spot to watch the big game n'at, too.

Belvedere's
Open nightly until 2 a.m.
When I think of dive bars, my mind instantly goes to the bamboo-walled dance floor of Belvedere's Ultra-Dive. If dancing is your release, Belvie's (as its affectionately known by the locals) is your go-to with everything from emo nights to house, electronic, disco and even line dancing-themed evenings. Plus, cheap drinks and lots of pool tables keep even the non-dancers in your group happy.

Kelly's Bar &amp; Lounge
Open until 2 a.m. Monday-Saturday
As the East Liberty neighborhood has completely changed in the past 10 years, one place remains the same. Kelly's neon sign continues to beckon hipster denizens like a siren's call to it's vintage booths, cheap cocktails and pink-hued dive bar. Get the mac and cheese, a panacea for having a drink (or three) too many before you head home in your Uber.

Bottlerocket Social Hall

Trivia nights, sing-alongs to popular musicals, film screenings, improv, comedy, live music. The list goes on and on at Bottlerocket Social Hal l in Allentown. This dive bar was intentionally purchased and opened as it was from the 90s, so expect lots of wood paneling, floral couches and drop ceilings at this incredible live venue.

Jekyl &amp; Hyde
Open daily until 2 a.m.
Pittsburgh loves Halloween, but at Jekyl &amp; Hyde in the South Side, it's spooky season 365 days a year. The kitsch here is literally oozing off the walls (at least I think that's ooze) and ceiling with Halloween décor covering every inch. Add their devilishly good cocktails and shots and karaoke nights, live music and DJs to the cauldron, and there's a reason this place is bubbling over with patrons every night of the week.

Cobra
Open until 2 a.m. Saturdays
Cobra is the perfect first-stop of your night out in the Burgh. You can begin with a chic meal at their smokeless grill private tables, move to the lounge or a karaoke room, then stick around for live DJs after dinner hours on Friday and Saturday nights.
Everything here is upscale from the world-class soundsystem and intimate karaoke rooms to the bottle service of rare Japanese whiskys.

Cattivo
Open until 2 a.m. Wednesdays-Saturdays
Cattivo sums up everything I love about the Lawrenceville neighborhood in one venue; great live music and DJs, welcoming people, a great bar and the best atmosphere.
Feel free to just show up here for drinks and to play some pinball with your friends, or check their concert calendar on Insta to dance the night away; this location features some of the most varied live music in the city.

Spirit
Open until 2 a.m. Fridays &amp; Saturdays
Not far from Cattivo is Spirit, another hybrid bar/event space concept with two floors and tons of space for your night out.
Their pizzas are great, the walls outside are covered in beautiful art and separate live music spaces means that you can sometimes see completely different genres and dance parties (like a cosplay rave on one floor and a queer joy dance party on the next) without ever leaving the building.

Rock Room
Open daily until 2 a.m.
The perfect night out for the punk crowd is through the doors of the Rock Room up on Polish Hill.
The beer and food are cheap, everyone is wearing denim, smoke fills the air and graffiti covers every surface. Just like the venues I loved growing up. Plus, this place follows the punk rock rule of being welcoming to everyone so you'll never feel out of place.

After the Party
If you're in need of a little healing the morning after an unforgettable night out, there are a few perfect "cure-worthy" breakfast/brunch spots that will hit the spot.
My personal favorite is Pamela's Diner. This diner has multiple locations in the city including the Strip District. The famous stuffed, crepe-style hotcakes are a must-try on any visit to Pittsburgh, but after a night out, they definitely hit the spot. There is even a menu item made just for you: "The Morning After Breakfast Special" – 2 eggs, a choice of meat, and, of course, hotcakes. (Pro-tip: get a side of Famous Lyonnais Potatoes, too. You won't regret it).
Other great downtown options are Cherries Diner, Nicky's Grant Street, and for something a little more upscale, brunch at FL.2 won't disappoint.
