Anti-Litter and Illegal Dumping
Littering and dumping has major effects on the City of Pittsburgh and its residents, so we are tackling the problem through prevention, education, abatement and enforcement. Our team is dedicated to finding creative, new, and data-driven solutions to these unlawful and unwanted practices.
If you see illegal dumping happening in the act, call 911.
If you find illegal dumping after the fact, call 311.
Want to combat litter and illegal dumping? The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works can help. If you host a volunteer clean-up, we will provide supplies and pick up of all collected refuse. See our Volunteer Clean-Up Application below for more information.
