Sheraden Park

Sheraden Park History(show below)

In 1914, the City purchased 23 acres of the old Sheraden farm which would form the foundation of Sheraden Park.
The city had annexed the Borough of Sheraden seven years earlier. Over the years the park grew as adjacent parcels were purchased, bringing it to 52 acres today.
Future land acquisition is planned in order to connect the park to nearby Chartiers Creek. The park is now a well-loved, intimate gathering space that is an integral part of the West Pittsburgh community.

Sheraden Park is nestled between Pittsburgh's Sheraden, Esplen, and Chartiers City neighborhoods. The park boasts historic trees, a pool, basketball and tennis courts, baseball, football, and soccer fields, as well as a woodland trail.
It's nearby sister park, McGonigle, features basketball courts, a baseball field, and playground. The Sheraden Park Skate Park is roughly one mile from the main park complex and shelter rental information is available.
