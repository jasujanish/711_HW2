And the Heinz History Center gift shop has a huge collection of Pittsburgh wares. Grab a Mister Rogers ornament, Heinz dog collar, Iron City onesie or just a history center sweatshirt to show your pride for Pittsburgh‚Äôs Smithsonian museum.
You can also shop the Carnegie Museum of Art‚Äôs gift shop in person or online. While they have Pittsburgh-inspired pieces like a Dippy the Dinosaur trucker hat or Campbell‚Äôs tomato soup crayon set, we also love the totes, apparel and tumblers featuring the CMOA‚Äôs new branding.
