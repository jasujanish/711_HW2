Seeing the Savannah Bananas in Pittsburgh? Here's What Else to Check Out While in Town
Ready to go bananas when you're not at the Bananas game?
The Savannah Bananas, renowned for their fun, fan-first style of baseball, are taking over Pittsburgh on August 29 and 30. The Steel City is buzzing with activities and attractions for you to take in between shenanigans at the ballpark.
Get to know PNC Park
The Bananas will be playing at PNC Park, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Recently named the #4 MLB stadium in the country in USA Today's 10Best contest for 2025, PNC Park boasts gorgeous views of Pittsburgh's iconic skyline while playing host to some of baseball's greatest culinary items.
How to get to PNC Park
Public Transportation
Since parking on the North Shore near the stadium is limited, it's often easier to park and ride to the stadium using other options. Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) offers light rail service on the T and city buses for fans coming from Downtown Pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. You can find more information on how to get to the stadium on the PRT website. Driving &amp; Parking Information
If you are planning to drive and park near the stadium, visit ALCO parking for a helpful interactive guide to parking on the North Shore.

Where to stay near PNC Park
Pittsburgh has plenty of places to park between the Bananas game and any other activities you have planned. You can stay close to the ballpark at places like Hyatt Place North Shore or the Residence Inn by Marriott North Shore.
If you're looking to get away from the sports hustle and bustle of the North Shore, you could stay in the hustle and bustle of Downtown. From Market Square to PNC Park, it's an approximate 12 minute walk; if you don't feel like walking, you can take Pittsburgh Regional Transit's T light rail system for free from three different stations throughout Downtown. Consider staying at the Kimpton Hotel Monaco, the Fairmont, the Drury Inn &amp; Suites, the Wyndham Grand by Point State Park, or the Hilton Garden Inn, just to name a few.
Where to eat near PNC Park
The North Shore, home to PNC Park, is filled with plenty of bars and restaurants for all baseball fans.
Shorty's Pins &amp; Pints, Southern Tier, Tom's Watch Bar, Jason Aldean's, Bar Louie, and Mike's Beer Bar are popular spots to grab a craft beer pre- or post-game that are walkable to PNC Park. Even if you don't have a ticket, these locales are some of the best places to watch the game outside of PNC Park, promising a lively atmosphere and passionate fans cheering on every play to go with your food and drink.
If you're looking to eat inside of the stadium, here are the food highlights you can expect to find (spoiler, they're all mouthwatering).

More cool things to do near PNC Park
There's so much to do in the North Shore we did a whole blog about everything to explore pre- or post-game, from stadium tours and museum visits to kayaking, duckpin bowling and more. Here are our suggestions to make the most of your time in our city of multitudes:

Show your Pittsburgh pride by taking a selfie with the Roberto Clemente Statue, which sits outside of PNC Park.

Stand at the spot of the Immaculate Reception, the most well-known play in NFL history, where Steelers legend Franco Harris caught a ball just before it touched the grass and changed the fate of the franchise.
