Community Development
The Community Development Division of the Office of Management and Budget administers and monitors federal grants to the City of Pittsburgh. The programs, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), are grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
HOME, which focuses on encouraging affordable housing, is administered by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. HOPWA, which focuses on providing housing for persons with HIV/AIDS, is administered by the Jewish Healthcare Foundation. These organizations are responsible for reporting to the Community Development Division.
The City of Pittsburgh uses CDBG funds for many different improvement projects, such as repairing roads and demolishing vacant buildings. Nonprofits can also apply to receive funds from CDBG and ESG through the City, which they will use to benefit people with low to moderate incomes, people experiencing homelessness, or neighborhoods in need of economic development. CDBG funds are awarded by the City as Public Service Grants (PSG) and Neighborhood Economic Development Grants (NED).
If you represent an organization interested in receiving funding, please visit the program page for more information.
If you are an individual interested in participating in making decisions about funding priorities or learning more about our current activities, please visit our Public Engagement page.
The Community Development Division does not assist individuals directly. If you are in need of services, please see our Resources for Individuals document(PDF,Â 139KB).
