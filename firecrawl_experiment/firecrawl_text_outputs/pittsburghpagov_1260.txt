Recycling Drop-Off Locations
As the City of Pittsburgh is working to reduce contamination at our drop-off centers, please follow some simple best practices and guidelines below:

Place items loosely in the containers (dumpsters/roll-offs). This means no plastic bags! However, shredded paper must be contained in a paper bag and placed into a dumpster marked for "mixed paper" at one of the drop-off centers listed below.
Flatten all cardboard before placing it into the recycling dumpster.
Follow the clearly marked signs on each dumpster instructing what we accept.
Do not place any loose plastic or metal lids or caps of any kind into our recycling dumpsters.

Good news! Now you can recycle more containers! As of January 2025, we are now accepting butter tubs, cottage cheese, yogurt, and sour cream containers in the recycling!

Recycling Contamination, and Why It Matters?
One of the biggest challenges facing recycling right now is contamination by wishful recycling or “wish-cycling”. This happens when non-recyclable objects are placed in the recycling bin with the wish it will be recycled. Additionally, recycling contamination occurs when food residue, liquids, and unacceptable materials—such as bagged recyclables, plastic bags, plastic films, plastic packaging, electronics, hazardous waste, Styrofoam, batteries, sharps, food waste, greasy pizza boxes, and other durable goods like Tupperware, storage containers, or even plastic hangers—are placed in the recycling can. Contaminants not only degrade the materials, boosting costs, but they can potentially cause harm to the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) and city employees.
