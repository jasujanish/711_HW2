The Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations (PghCHR) is a civil rights enforcement agency focused on investigating instances of discrimination, providing outreach and education to communities about their rights, and recommending necessary protections in the City Code to provide all people in Pittsburgh with equal opportunities. Our goal is to decrease unfair treatment and discrimination by promoting justice and understanding among communities in the City of Pittsburgh.
Our office hours are Monday-Friday 9am-5pm. We are closed on City-recognized holidays. Due to staff working a hybrid schedule, we ask that you please call 412-255-2600 or email human.relations@pittsburghpa.gov to schedule ahead of time. We cannot take walk-in appointments at this time.
