Pittsburgh Holiday Pop-Up Bars
It seems like pop-up bars just keep popping up! Let us help you find the most perfectly peculiar Pittsburgh pop-up for the holiday season and beyond.
Here You Come A-Wassailing
Have you ever wanted to have a night out at the North Pole, partying with Santa, Mrs. Claus and all the elves and reindeer? Well now you can, thanks to all of the awesome holiday-themed pop-up bars in Pittsburgh!
Sippin Santa
130 7th St, Pittsburgh Pa 15222 \| Opening Nov. 27, 2024
Love Miracle of 7th? Us too. You're in luck because the same creators of that experience are opening Sippin Santa. Envision Santa on a surfboard instead of a sleigh, replace the classic pine tree with palms decked with ornaments, and hang hibiscus garlands alongside tinsel—in essence, that is the Sippin’ Santa spirit.

Miracle on 7th
130 7th St., Pittsburgh Pa 15222 \| Opening Nov. 27, 2024
“Christmas isn’t just a day, it’s a frame of mind.” It’s clear that this is the philosophy used when creating Miracle on 7th. The whole place is bursting with Christmas cheer from its décor, to its drink offerings. Miracle on 6th brings the North Pole right to Downtown Pittsburgh, and this time Santa is bringing adults thoughtfully-named novelty cocktails in festive glassware (glassware available for purchase!) and a wonderful holiday vibe to Pittsburgh!

Bob's Garage
1372 Freeport Road, Pittsburgh \| Open Year-Round Monday-Saturday
Way before pop-up bars or dive bars became in vogue, Bob's Garage was the o.g. Christmas Bar. Floor to ceiling lights, tinsel, ornaments and stockings make this a must for Christmas fans. Even the outside is permanently decorated for Instagram-perfect photos. Add in a stellar bar staff, solid food and even karaoke, and you can see why this has been a Pittsburgh fixture for 50 years.
