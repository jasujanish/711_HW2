Workplaces Pending Policy Review: 589
Starting in January 2024, the Mayor's Office of Equal Protection initiated a food and beverage industry zip code campaign, contacting every ACHD-licensed business in the city for a Compliance Check. We sent Notices of Compliance Demands to almost 3000 businesses, requesting their Paid Sick Leave policies and proof that they'd posted the City notice in accessible locations in their stores and in all languages regularly spoken by staff. As of summer 2024, the Office of Equal Protection has collected policies from almost 18% of businesses served with Notices. We review submitted policies and return them with recommended revisions necessary to comply with the PSDA. Less than 30% of all policies submitted are compliant on their first try. Compliance reviews are ongoing.
Businesses with policies that demonstrate compliance are eligible for recognition as Safe Workplaces or, if they exceed the minimum requirements of the Paid Sick Days Act, Thriving Workplaces.
