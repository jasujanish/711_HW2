Debt Affordability Metrics
Because the capital budget is funded primarily through bond proceeds, the City must determine the amount of debt they can afford to issue. Knowing the debt affordability helps to manage and prioritize the City’s debt and make informed financing decisions to fund long-term capital needs. These three debt affordability metrics below are used to help the City of Pittsburgh determine its debt capacity.
Tax Supported Debt Burden Principal Divided by Full Taxable Assessed Value
The City of Pittsburgh has planned to limit its tax supported debt burden principal to amount 3.5% of full taxable assessed value. The lower the City’s municipality’s debt is relative to assessed value of its property, the less risky its bonds are deemed to be. A higher ratio could indicate that the City may have difficulty repaying the debt. As you can see below, the tax supported debt burden principal is below 3.5% over the next five (5) years. It ranges from 1.99% to 2.33%. This is assuming $60 million of debt is issued annually from 2018-2022 along with a 1% increase of the Full Taxable Assessed Value each year. The Full Taxable Assessed Value is based upon the amount that is billed for real estate taxes in the City of Pittsburgh.
