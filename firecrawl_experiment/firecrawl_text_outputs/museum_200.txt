Teen Night: Bubbles and Broomsticks
Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History  Thursday, October 9, 2025  5–8 p.m.
Teens are invited to defy gravity and fly over to Teen Night: Bubbles and Broomsticks!
Calling all Ozians: explore Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History with your friends in search of potions, experiments, bubbling brews, and a bug buffet, where you can trick or treat yourself to some creepy crawlers. Create your own unique wand and make art from bubbles, just like Glinda! Deconstruct stuffed animals to craft henchmen like flying monkeys or design a witchy, outrageous costume for our costume challenge. The future is unlimited, as are the number of wickedly fun activities happening at Teen Night: Bubbles and Broomsticks.
Sign up today because this event will be a wicked good time.
This event is open to all teens ages 13–18. Whether you’ve already signed up for a free Teen Membership from Carnegie Museums or just want to see what it’s all about, we hope you’ll stop by!
