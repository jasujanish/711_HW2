Assessment Report – April 2017(PDF, 15MB)
The Assessment Report is the first step toward determining what zoning approach is best to create a permanent riverfront zoning district for the City of Pittsburgh. It presents an understanding of the existing conditions and the various concerns – the existing land use and zoning patterns along the three rivers, obstacles to physical and visual access to the rivers, the City’s previously adopted policies and goals for the riverfront, and current stakeholder input on key issues to determine a general course of action.
