Community Meetings &amp; Events
The Pittsburgh City Council District 8 led a community-driven process through in-person meetings and online engagement. Residents, park-goers, and stakeholders shared their input for the future of Wightman Park and develop a Master Plan during meetings held in December 2014, April 2015, May 2015, and October 2015. Once community priorities were identified, fundraising occurred throughout 2016 and 2017. Additional community meetings and events to finalize the design and to discuss construction plans will occur in 2018.
