Take a Historical Tour Along Pittsburgh’s Sports Heritage Trail
It’s well known that Pittsburgh bleeds Black and Gold, with a rich sports history spanning most professional leagues. But even the most ardent fans might be surprised by some of the sports legacies in the Pittsburgh region.
The Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center is a perfect place to dive into the rich sports history of the area. Sports Museum curators have also outlined a Sports Heritage Trail so that you can visit the spots – both famous and little-known – where so many milestones have (and will) take place!
For The Football Fan
Pittsburgh’s North Shore, which is home to Acrisure Stadium and PNC Park, is dotted with several historical markers, including one noting the birthplace of the first professional football game. It all technically started not far from where the Pittsburgh Steelers play now, with a man named William “Pudge” Heffelfinger. On Nov. 12, 1892, the former Yale All-American guard led the Allegheny Athletic Association to victory over the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and made $500 for his efforts. You can also view the former Three Rivers Stadium Gate D Pylon, Art Rooney Statue, Great Hall and Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, among others. Eventually, you can make your way to Pittsburgh East to see the graves of football legends Jock Sutherland and Beano Cook.

For The Baseball Fan
Pittsburgh is proudly home to the No. 1 Major League Baseball stadium in the country, and a vibrant baseball history. Pittsburgh was, as the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum describes, “once the center of Negro League Baseball.” In the 1930s and ’40s, the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords dominated the league and produced legendary players like Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Judy Johnson, and “Cool Papa” Bell. And if you go to a Pittsburgh Pirates game today, you’ll see the stadium is surrounded by statues and references to Pirates greats like Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, Honus Wagner, and Bill Mazeroski. If you’re in town for a game, you won’t want to miss these incredible nods to Pittsburgh’s baseball past.

For The Basketball Fan
Pittsburgh may not have a National Basketball Association (NBA) team, but did at one point have an American Basketball Association (ABA) team called the Pittsburgh Pipers and later the Pittsburgh Condors). We are proud to be the hometown of NBA Hall of Famer Chuck Cooper. The former Duquesne University player became the first African American to join the NBA in 1950, when he was drafted by the Boston Celtics.

For The Hockey Fan
Pittsburgh’s hockey legacy has not only been sealed with numerous Stanley Cup wins, but also in the 1995 Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie Sudden Death, which was filmed and set in the former Civic Arena during a Penguins Stanley Cup final. While the movie is filled with fun Pittsburgh Easter eggs, our history with hockey is far from fictional! You can check out the site of the former arena, not far from the current day PPG Paints Arena where the Pittsburgh Penguins now play, as well as odes to former player and current team owner Mario Lemieux.

For The Golf Fan
Pittsburgh has proudly been home to numerous U.S. Open tournaments, all hosted at the prestigious Oakmont Country Club. In fact, the U.S. Open will return to Oakmont in 2025, marking the record 10th year for the event in Pittsburgh. You’ll definitely want to view this course and see for yourself why it remains a top spot for this tournament. Pittsburgh is also home to several other notable golf courses, including Montour Heights Country Club which was designed by legendary architect Pete Dye and the Fox Chapel Golf Club which has hosted several notable championships, including the U.S. Senior Women’s Open. And of course, one of the greatest golfers of all time, Arnold Palmer, hails from just outside the city, from Latrobe.
