The these funds are distributed by the City as Public Service Grants (PSG), used by nonprofits to fund a wide variety of projects. Awarded projects provide direct services to Pittsburgh residents with low to moderate incomes. PSG has funded projects such as food pantries, youth programs, job training, career counseling, literacy programs, senior activity programs, and more.
