South Side Riverfront Trail Park Designation Expansion
Expanding the ‘parks’ designation along the South Side Riverfront Trail to include from 4th-18th St will benefit the 1.1 million trail users per year, South Side Flats and Slopes neighbors, Carson Street businesses and patrons alike, and our goals are to:

Enhance natural beauty

Maintain continuity of trail

Preserve access to river’s edge

Activate the public space for more recreation opportunities

Create more activities for children and families

Improve trail care, maintenance, and safety

Direct trail users toward Carson St businesses, and Carson St visitors toward the trail

Stay tuned for more info, or join us at an upcoming South Side Community Action Network Neighbor Night to discuss in break-out group!

South Side Business District Manager
The historic Carson Street business district, though vibrant and eclectic, currently has a 26% vacant storefront rate. Our office is working with the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, South Side Community Council, South Side Hospitality Partnership, the Urban Redevelopment Authority, South Side Chamber of Commerce, and State Representative Jess Benham to hire a business district manager to attract, support, and retain businesses along the Carson Street corridor. Thank you to all working to revitalize our shopping and entertainment district, with special shout-out to Ed John and Don Berman for their leadership!
