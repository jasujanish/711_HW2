Cheer on the Pittsburgh Riverhounds
Add a trip to Highmark Stadium to your 2025 Pittsburgh Itinerary
We all know the Steelers', Pirates' and Penguins' pedigrees in Pittsburgh. But what if I told you one of the best nights out in the city happens in a stadium on the south side of the city, complete with scenic views, exciting games and a friendly, high-energy atmosphere?
Enter the Pittsburgh Riverhounds, the city's professional soccer team. Before you exit the blog and try to tell me soccer is boring, hear me out. The Hounds (as they're affectionately known) play playoff caliber soccer on the pitch, but the entire game experience from tailgating to after-the-game activities are geared to keep adults and kids happy.
Follow along with my Insider's Guide to the Hounds for my tips on what's new for the 2025 season, the best places to sit, the food to grab and some info you'll only be able to find in this blog. I've been following the Riverhounds for years, and can confidently say that your ticket to the game is one of the best values in sports anywhere in the country.
What's New for 2025
Something that keeps me coming back to the Hounds every year is that there's always something new and exciting happening for games so that no two evenings are alike. Here's just a few highlights of the promotions happening in 2025:

Fireworks Frenzy — Join the Riverhounds on the field after the match for four dazzling postgame fireworks shows, starting with the season’s home opener March 22 against Hartford Athletic. The pyrotechnic fun will also run on June 21, July 29 and Oct. 11, with the Downtown skyline providing the perfect backdrop.
$1 Beers and Bands — Start the pregame festivities early with the always-popular $1 Beer promotion from 5 p.m. until kickoff, and wind down with a live postgame concert on the field. May 31, June 28, Aug. 9 and Sept. 27 are the dates to mark for our fan-favorite beverage special.
FamFest — Bring the whole family on these dates with extra, interactive fun for younger fans. Mascot Mania returns on May 3, “Be Our Neighbor”/Changemakers Community Impact Night falls on July 4, Touch-a-Truck comes to Highmark on July 13 and Community Heroes Night on Sept. 13.
Spotlight Series — Don’t miss another great series of special celebrity guest and nationally touring entertainment acts. This year’s goes lineup includes WWE Hall of Famer Jake “The Snake” Roberts on Aug. 16, actor Efren Ramirez (Pedro from “Napoleon Dynamite”) on Aug. 2 and “Dance Moms” star Melissa Gisoni kicking off the series on March 29. Highlighting the halftime show lineup is the high-energy performance of Bucket Ruckus, who will take the field at Highmark during the team’s annual “White Aht Night” on June 7.
Several special giveaway nights will also be held throughout the season, including the March 22 home opener with a special Eric Dick “Golden Glove” oven mitt giveaway, Highmark Stadium-modeled coaster set to take home from the anticipated June 7 match vs. Detroit and Robbie Mertz Bobblehead promotion on July 13.

Affordable Family Fun
Between the concessions, tickets and merch, going to a sporting event lately can quickly become expensive. Thankfully, there's no $18 cotton candy at Highmark Stadium. The Riverhounds make every effort to keep the cost of tickets and concessions low, making this sport accessible for fans to see live. Single game tickets start at $20 and parking is cheap and plentiful at lots and garages on that side of the city.
Let's talk atmosphere. Hounds games are programmed with kids in mind, and the fan experience is equally accommodating. You'll be sitting next to other families, local soccer teams and fellow fans, so kids are always welcome here! While there's a lot of cheering, the vibe is positive and even the other team's fans are here to have a good time.
There's plenty for kids to do at the stadium, too, even if they aren't as into the game. Head to the area behind the Supporters section to kick a soccer ball around with new friends and jump around in a bounce house to get out some energy. After the final whistle, stick around for the post-game autograph session when kids can meet their favorite players or just run around on the field.

What to Eat and Drink
If you've read my other sports blogs, you know my top concern for any sporting event is what I'm going to eat. Luckily, the Riverhounds understand what their fans want and provide a ton of tasty options that won't break the bank.
Highmark Stadium was the first in Pittsburgh to carry Crumbl Cookies! Check out the Tailgate Zone and Kid Zone for Oreo crumb cake, milk chocolate chip, confetti and snickerdoodle! Also new for this year is the addition of Stateside Vodka products including their refreshing Surfside seltzers. Even better, the fan fave pizza logs are now on the menu full-time.
You'll also find conventional concession stand items at stands dotted around the stadium, but keep a special eye out for:

Rotating food trucks before the game in their Tailgate Zone offering fresh flavors of the Burgh
Burger and nacho specials that rotate throughout the season (March specials include the Irish whiskey bacon burger and corned beef nachos)
Gluten-free vegan wraps, grilled chicken wraps and veggie wraps
The Family Fun Zone concession stand that lets you grab popcorn, cotton candy and other kid staples quickly without missing a minute of the action.

Where to Sit
I know people like to say this old cliché, but there's truly not a bad seat in the house at Highmark Stadium. The best viewing experience is sitting as close to the middle of the field and as high up as possible, giving you the best view of not only the game but also the city as trains buzz past and let out a friendly puff of steam midgame.
If your love of the beautiful game can't be contained, you'll find your outlet in the Supporters Section. This high-energy end of the stadium is where the Steel Army resides, drumming, leading chants throughout the game and setting off smoke during the frenzy of a goal celebration. My kids now demand that we sit there for every game and yell and laugh along.
Want to bring a group? I've had a blast with bachelor parties and work events in their club suites and the party deck, but the top option here is the I.C. Light Corner Kick Suite. This shipping container-turned-luxury suite gives up to 40 guests seats right on the field just feet from the action, and the viewing deck on top of the Box is the most unique view in pro sports.

Tickets
The Hounds make it easy to get tickets online, at the box office or at 412-865-GOAL for single games, season tickets and other options. My only recommendation here is that if you plan on going to several games this year, grab their flexbook. You get 11 tickets for the price of 10 and can use them however you want per game, whether you end up going solo or bringing the whole fam.

Join the Steel Army

We all cheer for the yellow soccer team / The yellow soccer team / The yellow soccer team.
Steel Army chant

Ready to become a true superfan of the Hounds? Consider joining the Steel Army, the independent supporters group for the team! This group not only brings the energy to the home games and tail gates, but helps organize trips and watch parties for the rest of the schedule. What I love about the Steel Army is how welcoming they are for new members. Feel free to walk right into their tailgate and say hello, and within five minutes you'll have a burger in hand and have met five new friends.

Highmark Stadium Expansion Planned
With the boom the soccer scene has seen in Pittsburgh, Highmark Stadium will be undergoing an expansion in order to meet U.S. Soccer’s Pro League Standards requiring a capacity of 15,000 for Division One sanctioning. The expansion to the home of the Riverhounds and the Riveters will feature more premium seating areas, a club with banquet space, and suites, providing a range of options for fans. These upgrades will allow the South Shore stadium to host additional sports and entertainment events, including concerts, and better serve the region. That means more seats, more events, and more fun for the whole family!
Since 2023, the Riverhounds have sold out 73% of their home matches and in each of the last two years, the Riverhounds’ average attendance has exceeded capacity with fans using standing room only opportunities to attend matches.
In their first season, the Riveters hosted 28,138 fans for six games. Their inaugural match brought in over 6,000 people, the fourth-largest soccer crowd in the stadium’s history.
When completed, the stadium is expected to attract almost 500,000 people in annual attendance.
Highmark Stadium has already been selected to host the 2027 NCAA Division III Soccer Championships.

Things to Do Nearby
The fun doesn't stop when the game is over. It's easy to make a trip to see the Riverhounds and Highmark Stadium into an all-day trip. The stadium is located right at the edge of Station Square, a 1.2 mile stretch of great dining and inventive ways to explore the city.
See the Square via horse drawn carriage at Mike's Carriage Service. Station Square is also home to the Mon Incline and the Gateway Clipper, two of the most iconic ways to take in the city via funicular and riverboat.
