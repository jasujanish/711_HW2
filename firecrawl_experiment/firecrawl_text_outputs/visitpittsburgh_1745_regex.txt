Know Your Roll \| 14 Best Sushi Spots in Pittsburgh
I had to be tricked into trying sushi for the first time. My friend took us all to a local Chinese restaurant but, on arrival and because it was his birthday, banned us from ordering anything other than from the sushi menu. Thus began my journey into the world of sushi, and this formative event has sent me on a neverending quest, searching for next great combo of rice and fresh fish.
For this blog, I was inspired by the 2011 documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi which follows the 85-year-old, Michelin star-winning Sukiyabashi Jiro as he reaches for sushi perfection at his 10-seat restaurant in a subway station. The drive, the meticulous preparation and work ethic, the constant pursuit of the perfect bite. It's a huge reason I love the craft of sushi and now want to help you find the best in the Burgh.

Know What You're Ordering
Sushi can be a bit overwhelming for first-timers, so here's a quick primer of words you might see throughout this article to help you decide where to go first.
Maki- these are the most popular type of sushi! Rolled sushi of fish/vegetables and rice with seaweed on the outside
Sashimi - No-rice sushi! Sashimi is solely slices of fish or meat
Nigiri- a small bite of rice topped with raw or prepared seafood
Uramaki- similar to maki but with the rice on the outside, nori (seaweed wrapper) on the inside
Tamago- sushi rice topped with cooked egg with a thin wrapping of seaweed
Fish types
Ahi - tuna
Uni - raw sea urchin
Tako (think the restaurant Downtown) - raw or poached octopus
Ebi - cooked shrimp
Unagi - cooked eel
Hamachi - raw yellowtail
Ebi - cooked shrimp
Sake - raw salmon

UMI
Located in Shadyside and sharing a bar with their sister restaurant, Soba, Umi is a one-of-a-kind sushi experience in Pittsburgh. You start by ascending a staircase with murals on each side before being led to a Tatami table that lets you sit close to the ground like a traditional Japanese meal while still being in a Western seat with your legs below you.
The menu here is simple; you can do a family style dinner for two or go all out with the 11 or 7-course omakase. I highly recommend going for the full experience, as the omakase is something you won't find anywhere else in the city as Mr. Shu prepares the freshest selections of sashimi with a salmon tartare appetizer and surprising chocolate sushi dessert.

Mola
Here's another term for you to know: Edomae. This style of sushi was popularized during the Edo period of Japan when enterprising sushi chefs invented one of the original fast foods, catching seafood and preparing it immediately and quickly to serve to passing travelers.
That same commitment to freshness is what makes Mola in East Liberty stand out, with much of the fish here coming directly from Japan. Expect huge slices of the freshest fish, superb waitstaff to guide even first-timers successfully through the menu, and a huge selection of nigiri, sashimi, hand rolls and more. Trust me, get the spicy edamame to start.

OTARU
The spectacular views from floor-to-ceiling windows are just one of the many reasons you'll be back to OTARU atop Mt. Washington again and again. Newly opened in 2024, OTARU will transport you to the streets of Tokyo with an elegant interior that reflects Japanese minimalism as you dine on delicately prepared nigiri, sashimi, hand rolls and special Otaru experience courses.

Golden Gai
The glimmering doors of Golden Gai in the East End may not be open for indoor dining just yet, but in the meantime, their takeout only sushi boxes are perfect for enjoying in Bakery Square. Plus, it's easy to grab and go: pick between maki, nigiri and sashimi boxes and you'll get a delicious feast of the freshest fish accompanied by edamame, ginger and wasabi (get the ponzu sauce)!

Sushi Kim 2
What other sushi place has a 4.8 rating on Google and located in the heart of a bustling Downtown with affordable? Sushi Kim 2 is just that good! The sushi lunch special is essential eating for workers in the city, and their massive selection of maki and sashimi can be ordered a la carte or as different combination platters. The Kim's Spicy Combo here is my go-to because you can get a taste of everything Mr. Kim does so well.

Little Tokyo
Friendly atmosphere, an engaged owner on site every day, a huge menu of Japanese flavors, Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebo has it all.
You could come back to Little Tokyo every day for a month and find a new favorite each time, but their unique chirashi sushi, scattered sashimi served over a bowl of sushi rice, and famous ginger dressing is what I crave every time.

Diners 2+1
With so many great Asian restaurants in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, it can be easy to walk right by the unassuming Diners 2+1 restaurant. But for those of us real about our rolls, we head right in.
You'll be blown away by the selection - their menu features at least five pages of rolls, combinations, nigiri, sashimi and specialty rolls that ensure the hardest part of your meal is making up your mind. The mango roll here is a must every time I go, but the Royal Boat is also an excellent option to split the freshest sashimi, nigiri and rolls with a friend and having the best of what they have to offer.

gi-jin
This upscale Downtown sushi restaurant most reminds me of Jiro's quest from the film I mentioned above. Fish and rice is a deceptively complex game, and the expert sushi chefs at Gi-Jin are elevating the ingredients, the presentation and entire experience to make this stop stand out.
Here, the nigiri is topped with bluefin caviar and goldleaf, the sashimi made from the finest A5 Miyazaki wagyu from Japan and every roll is heightened. Take their Southern California roll where the standard fare at any sushi place takes on a new life with heirloom tomato salsa, togarashi, basil and fried corn tortilla turning this into a showstopping bite.

Penn Ave Fish Co
Vaulted ceilings and modern elegance give Penn Ave Fish Co in the Strip District a distinct look compared to other sushi restaurants. I highly recommend waiting for a spot at their sushi bar for my favorite experience, but try to avoid the lunch crowd and visit at off hours.
You can taste the freshness here in each roll, as fresh fish is delivered today to make their signature rolls. My favorites are their signature lollipop roll, served on a toothpick with ponzu and a spicy sauce, and hot pepper roll, a unique blend of Pittsburgh and Japanese palates with spicy salmon, cream cheese and banana peppers.

Andy's Sushi at Wholey's
Right down the street from Penn Ave is Andy's, located inside Wholey's market. A favorite for the lunch crowd, get in line early and let Andy wow you with both his flavors and his banter while making this hidden gem one you need to know.
Signature rolls here include the Wholey maki with smoked salmon, eel, caviar, cucumber and avocado as well as the the Strip District roll with eel, salmon skin, scallion and teriyaki sauce.

Ginza
Pittsburghers know what they like, and Ginza in Bloomfield serves up a unique mix of traditional Japanese flavors with modern American appeal to make them stand out.
Their snow roll (shrimp tempura and cucumber topped with snow crab and served with chili sauce) and spicy girl (crunchy salmon and avocado topped with spicy tuna, mayo and tobiko) are two of my favorites, but order the maki for two so you can try these two plus any two regular rolls.

Umami
I'll admit, I rarely go to Umami in Lawrenceville solely for the sushi, but that's just because the rest of their menu that includes my favorites like karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and yaki udon are what I'm normally craving when I make reservations.
You eat with your eyes, and Umami excels at making every roll, sashimi and nigiri a feast for all of your senses with beautiful plating that makes each course special. Because Umami specializes in street food, I especially like getting the temaki here which is your roll wrapped in an easy to hold cone of deliciousness.

Kura Revolving Sushi Bar
Now open in the SouthSide Works, Kura Revolving Sushi Bar is a night out like nowhere else you'll find in Pittsburgh. Here, you'll order from touchscreens to pick the exact combination of handrolls, sushi, nigiri and even gunkan (sushi boats of seaweed filled with rice and fish), and each item is prepared and then sent your way via a conveyor belt to ensure the freshest possible bite.
The tech-infused fun continues with robots that deliver drinks straight to your table, and an ongoing game that counts each empty plate and unlocks videos and themed prizes that keep every meal new and exciting.

Kujira
A higher price point and being unsure what you will like are two big roadblocks to enjoying sushi. Recently opened in Shadyside, Kujira aims to solve both of those problems by offering all-you-can-eat sushi at an approachable price. Their Pacific Experience allows you to order any rolls you like from the menu for $27.99, while an upgrade to the Tokyo Experience adds top-quality sashimi and sushi. A high-end omakase experience is also available.
Kujira is also unique in that it styles itself in the izakaya style, a more relaxed Japanese bar feel, and specializes in Japanese whisky, sake and beer in addition to their fresh fish.
