Come One + All: Celebrating Pittsburgh Pride and All Out Music Festival (+ other events to brighten your calendar)
It’s that time of year again when Pittsburgh Pride fills the streets with joy and community during an array of welcoming events spread across town.
This year’s highlights range from Prom and the Kiki Ball May 30 to the march and parade taking place Sunday, June 1, with tons of vendors, performances and festive gatherings sprinkled in between. (Keep an eye on the official website as more details get announced.) Organized by a group of local LGBTQ+ organizations including TransYOUniting, Pittsburgh Pride aims to ”stand tall as a beacon of the rust belt’s revival and the joy of honoring those that came before us.”
The weekend also kicks off with Friday’s anticipated Nick Staples Presents All Out Music Festival at Stage AE — a celebration of music, artistry and drag with gates opening at 3 p.m., and the fun continuing until 11 p.m. This year’s lineup includes acts like Galantis, Dragonette, Grant Knoche, Maude LaTour, Hayla, Snow Wife and more. (Lineup times will drop in the next week or two.)

We caught up with All Out organizer Nick Staples to learn what will make this year shine. When asked what he’s been up to since last year's Pride festivities, Staples admits it’s been a whirlwind, in the best way. “After wrapping up last year’s All Out (Formerly Pride on the Shore),” he says, “I dove headfirst into planning — not just for this year’s Pride, but also expanding All Out Music Fest to new cities, including Columbus.” He shares that it’s been nonstop behind-the-scenes — booking artists, refining experiences and making sure this year’s events are even bigger and better.

So what can Pittsburgh folks expect from this year's extravaganza?
“We’re keeping the heart of All Out Pride the same,” Staples promises. “It's still a space where everyone is welcome, celebrated and can dance their hearts out.”
And when it comes to new additions, they’ve expanded the production and energy. “This year is all about leveling up: bigger stage, brighter lights and more immersive moments between sets,” Staples explains. “We’re also bringing in some surprise elements (think confetti, CO2 blasts) to make those headliner moments unforgettable. Plus, we’re putting a bigger spotlight on local talent and drag royalty, making sure our lineup reflects the full spectrum of this amazing community.”

Staples, for one, feels great excitement about the 2025 lineup. “We’re kicking Pride weekend off with high-energy dance and club vibes — Galantis, Hayla, Dragonette and a Miami drag takeover and so much more,” he says. “I think it gives folks a chance to experience both sides of Pride — the wild celebration and the feel-good unity.”
Galantis is obviously going to bring the heat, Staples reassures, since they never miss when it comes to delivering those euphoric drops. “But I’m also really hyped for Hayla,” he shares. “Her voice paired with those dance beats is going to give people chills.” He believes this lineup will be iconic, and that there’s truly something for everyone.
When it comes to preparing to attend, Staples advises folks to: hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! “And wear whatever makes you feel your absolute best,” he adds, “this is your space to shine.” For first-timers, Staples suggests getting there early to soak in the vibe, check out local performers and stake out a good spot. “And don’t be shy; Pittsburgh’s Pride crowd is one of the friendliest you’ll meet,” he says.
Plan your ride home ahead of time, too, so you can end the night stress-free. And most importantly, Staples says, “Talk to strangers, dance like nobody’s watching, and let yourself be fully in the moment.”

Other inspiring events to keep on your radar in the weeks and months to come:
~ Pittsburgh Pierogi Festival celebrates its 10th anniversary on May 17 at SouthSide Works, with vendors serving more than 100 delicious pierogi and pierogi-inspired dishes from Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Texas and West Virginia. Don’t miss pierogi-inspired brews and cocktails, free activities and contests, plus live music and an appearance by Pittsburgh’s favorite pierogi mascots.
~The Mattress Factory’s annual Garden Party dazzles once again on Friday, June 6, this year following a theme of all things PINK. Think: “Pink gardens, Pink art, Pink cocktails, Pink curtains, Pink furniture, Pink costumes, Pink dance floor, Pink lights, Pink music, Pink food, Pink life.” This annual themed fundraiser features “dancing, dining, drinking and dreaming,” and 100% of proceeds benefit the artistic, education and community outreach programs at Mattress Factory.
~On a different color note, celebrate all things green during educational evenings at Phipps Conservatory, like a “Moon and Moonlight Photography” class with Don Orkoskey June 3 and a “Secret History of Plants: Phipps After Hours Tours” with Boaz Frankel June 17.
~Savor a Churchview Farm feast on this small, sustainable, third-generation family farmette located in the South Hills. Rather than being a production farm, this venue acts as a teaching space that focuses on fostering relationships and engagement within the community. Check out seasonal events here that support their educational endeavors, like enticing chef’s dinners (that typically sell out well in advance). Join their mailing list to stay in the know! Brighten your June with meals that are part of the Weeknight Farm Dinner Series, featuring Balvanera, Driftwood Oven, Jillian’s Restaurant and Bonfire.
~French-inspired restaurant and "cottage-core" venue Hyeholde hosts its first-ever "Black Tie Farmers Market " (followed by the Annual Spring Dinner) on Thursday, June 12. Wander the picturesque grounds, shop local purveyors' goods (from jams and jellies to flowers and artwork), and savor delectable bites and cocktails.
~Get your palate ready for sweet summertime treats, with can’t-miss offerings at Jeni’s Ice Cream (where recent additions include Tropical Bloom and Citrus Glazed Pound Cake) and MilkShake Factory, where you can enjoy new flavors like Mint Chip and Raspberry, plus a $5 Milkshake Happy Hour every Thursday from 4 to 6 p.m. at all locations.
~Beer lovers rejoice at celebratory gatherings like Beers of the Burgh, returning to the Carrie Blast Furnaces June 7, where you can sample brews from 50+ local breweries in one of Pittsburgh coolest historic settings, plus Barrel &amp; Flow Fest August 9 @The Stacks at 3 Crossings.
~Summer music gatherings are starting to drop their lineups, too — like the Millvale Music Festival May 16 and 17, The Dollar Bank Three Rivers Arts Festival June 5 through 8 and Summer Fridays at The Frick (June 27, July 25, August 8, August 29). Bring on porch, patio and picnic blanket season, we say!
