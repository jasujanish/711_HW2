Pittsburgh is in the national spotlight again in USA Today's 10 Best Readers' Choice Awards!

Here are some of the highlights:
Best History Museum
Heinz History Center (#1)
For the second year in a row, the Heinz History Center has been voted the #1 History Museum in America by readers of USA Today!
The contest featured museums from as far as Kansas that were chosen by an expert panel and voted by readers as the best in the United States.
The Heinz History Center, which was also voted "Pittsburgh's Best Museum" in 2022, is Pennsylvania’s largest history museum where you can see Smithsonian artifacts daily throughout six floors of engaging exhibitions, perfect for visitors of all ages.
The museum’s flagship exhibit, Pittsburgh: A Tradition of Innovation, is where you can flex like Rosie the Riveter, learn about the region’s contributions to the Apollo 11 moon landing mission, and see how Pittsburgh transformed from a steel-making industrial powerhouse to a worldwide leader in technology, medicine, and education.

The Heinz History Center preserves the history of Western Pennsylvanians and helps educate visitors with six floors of interactive exhibits. A highlight is the "Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood" exhibit — the show was filmed in Pittsburgh — which displays the welcoming living room set, the Great Oak Tree, and King Friday XIII’s Castle.
