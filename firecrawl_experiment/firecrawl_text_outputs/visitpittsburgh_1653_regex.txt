Supporting Local Radio Station WYEP + Hot Summer Concerts Coming Our Way
With all public radio stations currently under attack, it seems a good time to learn more about 91.3 WYEP — including all they have going on in coming months, plus ways we can ensure they stick around. This beloved independent public radio station celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2024; they brighten our days with the sounds of indie rock, Americana, blues, roots and classic/modern rock, too.
We recently caught up with Program Director Liz Felix who’s been with the station since 2019, and got promoted to her current role in 2021.
My favorite part is sharing music with people in the Pittsburgh community, whether it’s on-air, in the studio for one of our Live & Direct sessions, or out at shows.

In news that’s certainly music to our ears, this spring and summer will feature eight free shows — part of the station’s brand-new Neighborhood Concert Series that brings live music to various Pittsburgh-area pockets. Felix explains that when the station celebrated its 50th anniversary, they wanted to do something fun for the community. “We started a Live Music Fund that was specifically aimed at raising money to support Pittsburgh’s live music ecosystem,” she says, “and the Neighborhood Concert Series is one way that we’re putting that fund into action. The idea is that the station brings free live music from local and national artists to different parts of the Pittsburgh region where WYEP traditionally hasn’t done events.”
The lineup includes artists making music in Pittsburgh that radio staff happen to love, like Merce Lemon and Animal Scream (who played the first series show they held in April). Others like Clover County, Snacktime and Kashus Culpepper are up-and-coming artists they’ve been playing on the station to generate interest. “And then we’ve got some longtime favorites, like Nick Lowe and Chuck Prophet,” Felix says. “So it’s a mix of different venues and music styles. We’re basically choosing artists from different genres and different places in their career trajectories, much like we do on the air every day on WYEP.”
So what to expect from these Neighborhood shows? Felix says mostly it’s a way for folks to find out about talented live performers from the Pittsburgh area and beyond. As an added bonus, all shows in the series cost nothing and welcome all ages. “We’re excited to be a part of the Allegheny County Summer Concert shows this year with Chuck Prophet and Nick Lowe,” she shares. “We’re also putting on a folk festival with the County on September 6th, featuring the Virginia folk trio Palmyra. We’re programming the stage at one of Mt. Lebanon’s Final Fridays in July, which will be really fun and family-friendly.” But really, she adds, their staff is excited about all these shows. “They’re all different from each other,” she says. “It’s fun for us to travel to new venues that we haven’t done events with yet.”
The best way to support WYEP (and other public stations), Felix says, is to make a donation — whether recurring or a one-time offering. “We’re a public radio station, and our work on and off the air depends on listener support,” she says. “And of course, we’d love to see everyone out at these concerts!”

While planning a robust summer of music, here are some other Pittsburgh-area shows on our radar:
We’re thrilled that Vampire Weekend will be playing Stage AE June 3 (with Geese as opener). The band, which formed in NYC nearly two decades ago now, released their well-received fifth studio album “Only God Was Above Us” Tour Part 2 on April 5, 2024, through Columbia Records. We can’t wait to see what they bring to this latest tour!

We’re so excited that Rilo Kiley is coming to Roxian Theatre on September 11.This reunion tour marks the group’s first one together in 17 years, after officially breaking up in 2011, and it feels particularly special to have them gracing our city with their much-anticipated presence.
