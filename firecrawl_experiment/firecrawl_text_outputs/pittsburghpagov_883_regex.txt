However, if the license expires 12/31/25 or later, you may disregard the renewal that you received. the corrected renewals were mailed on 12/09/2024. If you have any questions, you may call us at 412-255-2967. We are sorry for any inconvenience.
A license is required for every dog, age three-months and older, living in the City of Pittsburgh. Dog licenses and registration tags help to assist in finding lost pets. Annual dog licenses are valid from January 1st through December 31st of each year.
