Best Bagels in the 'Burgh
We scoured the region for the best bagels in Pittsburgh, from buttery breakfasts to savory snacks.
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but what if you're just looking for something quick and easy to get you by in the mornings? These bagel shops in Pittsburgh have food delectable enough to satisfy your breakfast cravings on the go and at home.
Burgh's Bagels
Robinson Township
Offering a cozy atmosphere for everyone, from business lunch to meeting friends, Burgh's Bagels in Robinson Township began after a boy from the Burgh met a girl from New York. Over the years, their family spent many mornings bonding over delicious breakfast sandwiches, and going back and forth on how the best way to layer bagel toppings are. Like any other family, they had their spats, but the one thing they did agree on was that nothing beat the New York bagel with a Pittsburgh view.
Burgh's Bagels has an array of bagel and cream cheese options as well as some unique sandwich combos. With everything they have to offer, it's no wonder they sell out before they officially close for the day. Get there early so you don't miss out on some of the Pittsburgh area's best bagels.

Balena Bagels
Castle Shannon
Balena Bagels makes a wide variety of bagels fresh daily, but get there early! They sell out quickly. Their bagels are made from all-natural, pure ingredients, unbleached unbromated flour, no corn syrup, no added processing agents. The word Balena means whale in Italian, and whales symbolize power and strength. Balena's Italian, Jewish, and North African cooking traditions influence their products.
Brooklyn Bagels at Arsenal
Lawrenceville
Locally-owned Lawrenceville cafe with fresh bagels, coffee, iced drinks, sandwiches, smoothies, bowls, salads, cookies, and more. Brooklyn Bagels at Arsenal has amazing breakfast sandwiches sure to make your tastebuds melt. If you're in the mood for something a little more, they also offer breakfast bowls, salads, smoothies, and more. And what's a breakfast without coffee? They have plenty of coffee options on their menu, sure to satisfy every caffeine connoisseur.
Lola's Eatery
Lawrenceville
In December of 2019, Max and Zoë Blume opened Lola's intending to offer Lawrenceville a brunch spot that offered dishes that not only included Filipino/Mexican influenced dishes but also fresh-baked bagels, customized cakes, delicious donuts, and so many more. Lola's Eatery offers a bar, espresso machine, and a few cake mirrors on top of delicious breakfast and brunch options. We recommend their ube cinnamon roll, but you truly can't go wrong with anything you get here.
Lola's is also the perfect place for a photo opportunity; I mean, look at the adorable aesthetic.

Pigeon Bagels
Squirrel Hill
Pigeon Bagels is a Kosher bagel shop in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. Located in a beautifully walkable location, Pigeon is the perfect place to grab a bite before heading out to enjoy the sunshine and fresh air when the weather breaks. This truly is the breakfast spot in Squirrel Hill, and that's proven each and every day just from the line each and every day. If you're planning to stop at Pigeon, we cannot recommend getting there early enough. Even if you don't though, the food is worth any amount of time spent in line.

Three Brothers Bagels

Three Brothers Bagels is a family owned business in Shaler Township. Co-owner Colin began experimenting with sourdough starters while living in Brooklyn before bringing his talent to the Pittsburgh area in 2020. The store opened in 2023 and has been a hit ever since.
