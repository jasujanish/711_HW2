What's a Fish Fry?
If you're not sure why fish on Friday is a thing, let me backup a bit. Lent (Mar. 5 - April 17, 2025), is a religious observance by many Christian denominations that covers a period of approximately six weeks before Easter Sunday. During all of the Fridays of Lent, Catholics over the age of 14 abstain from meat and from foods made with meat.
The end result? Places from churches to fire halls, restaurants and bars get in on the Fish Fry fun, offering up colossal fish sandwiches, Only in Pittsburgh pierogies, traditional Polish favorites like haluski and lots of mac-n-cheese, fries and other fried goodies. You don't need to be a member of the church to go, either; just head on in (bring cash) and experience the Pittsburgh Fish Fry for yourself! Home to a thriving culinary scene across various neighborhoods, you'll find a scrumptious array of fried fish offerings throughout Pittsburgh.
