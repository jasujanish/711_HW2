City Planning hosts various commissions, boards, and panels for reviewing development, design, public art, historic review, and zoning.
Historic Preservation Program
Pittsburgh's cultural heritage is the City's legacy, formed by its people, place, neighborhoods, buildings, landscapes, objects, and stories.
Public Art Program
Our Public Art Program ensures that art and culture have a place in public spaces and that the design of public spaces and civic structures has a positive impact on the City's public realm.
Neighborhood Planning
Neighborhood planners act as liaisons between City government and the community for most planning processes. Neighborhood planners participate in, and often coordinate, community plans. This group of planners acts as go-to people for explanations of zoning, development, transportation and other planning-related matters.
