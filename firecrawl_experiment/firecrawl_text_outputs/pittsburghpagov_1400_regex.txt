Building Codes
Uniform Construction Code
Construction in Pennsylvania, including the City of Pittsburgh, is regulated by the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act or PA Act No. 45 of 1999, which is also commonly referred to as the Uniform Construction Code (UCC). The UCC adopts, in whole or part, the International Code Council’s (ICC) I-Codes.
Current Codes
The 2018 Base and 2018 Accessibility Codes are currently adopted under the PCCA/UCC. For more information please see PLI's 2015 Code Deadline and 2018 Code Adoption(PDF, 525KB).
Pittsburgh Amendments
The City of Pittsburgh's adoption and amendment of the UCC is documented under Section 1002 of the Pittsburgh City Code. These local amendments remain applicable as the UCC is updated by the Commonwealth. While the City Ordinances reference specific 2003 I-code code sections, these amendments are enforced by PLI based on the code provision and/or topic.
