The Countdown Is On For The 2026 NFL Draft in Pittsburgh
What better way to celebrate than with a near-20-feet tall real-life clock right outside where the magic will happen?
Pittsburgh is officially on the clock for the 2026 NFL Draft, which will take over from April 23-25. You can feel the hype in the city and beyond, from the bustling Strip District streets on Sundays to the outskirts of downtown preparing to flood the North Shore with Pittsburgh pride. One of the most anticipated events in sports, the NFL Draft will soon meet the grit and glory that is the Steel City, and the community could not be more excited.
That's why the region's official countdown clock for the 2026 NFL Draft now sits in the Great Lawn along Pittsburgh's North Shore, showcasing the pride the city and its residents carry wherever they go. It is a visual symbol of excitement bubbling at the surface of the city.

This clock is more than just a timekeeper. It’s a symbol of the hard work ahead as we prepare to welcome the NFL, prospects, and fans from around the world.
Jerad Bachar, President &amp; CEO of VisitPITTSBURGH

A closer look...
The Sister Bridges-inspired steel beam holding the clock up features 180 total engraved notches – with one side representing regional programs that make up our area’s football legacy and the other showcasing all of Pittsburgh’s 90 unique neighborhoods just waiting to be explored.
Trust us: seeing the countdown clock is something you don't want to miss (and we're not just saying this because it's hard to miss). Take advantage of the sunshine and warm weather to journey down to the Great Lawn to admire the clock. While you're at it, we want to see how you're using the clock to countdown to the 2026 NFL Draft. Use #LovePGH and #2026NFLDraft to showcase your love for the North Shore's newest addition, and upload your photos of and with the clock here for the chance to be featured on our pages!
