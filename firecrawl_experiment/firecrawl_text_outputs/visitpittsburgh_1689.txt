Squirrel Hill: Neighborhood Guide
It's so very Pittsburgh that Squirrel Hill finds itself in a sandwich, but unlike the iconic Primanti Brother’s sandwich, the neighborhood sits between two of the city’s largest parks and between suburban and tourist.
A home away from home, if you’re not lucky enough to actually call Squirrel Hill home yourself. I did for a period of time and now sit here reminiscing on the days of walking past locally owned shops with a coffee or ice cream in hand, breathing in the fresh air and watching the stars. It’s hard to put into words the love I have for Squirrel Hill; how do you accurately describe a place that feels like it’s giving you a warm hug at every turn?
Let’s go back a few years, to when I first moved into a townhouse right off the main drag and made a list of all the places I wanted to go while I was just steps away from some of my eventual favorite spots. You’ll be in my shoes, strolling past mouth-watering pastries while also debating on where to stop for dinner out of the diverse amounts of restaurants in the area.
At the end of the day, it’s my hope you enjoy Squirrel Hill as much as I did when I lived there, and miss it when you leave as much as I have over the years, even though it’s a hop, skip and jump away.
For the purposes of this blog, I'm considering Squirrel Hill North and Squirrel Hill South as one collective neighborhood. They just blend so well. If you think I missed a spot, send me an email and let me know.

EAT

Whether you’re feeling a bit peckish or absolutely starving, whether you prefer sweet, salty or savory, Squirrel Hill has one of the best arrays of diverse dining options I’ve seen in the city. Here are just some of my favorites:
GABY ET JULES
If you’re in the mood for authentic French pastries, look no further than Gaby et Jules. Chef David Piquard was recruited to come to the United States from France to be a head pastry chef, and the pride he has for his craft shows the second you walk through the door at their Squirrel Hill location. The sweet, delicious macarons are made from almond flour, just like across the pond, and David sources a lot of the ingredients he uses from France.

PIGEON BAGELS
Further down the way, Pigeon Bagels offers a wide selection of breakfast and pastry options. The walk-up order window reminds me of getting ice cream after a little league baseball game and ignites that little spark of childhood nostalgia in my chest. It’s also kosher, which caters to Squirrel Hill’s Jewish community.
WAFFALLONIA Waffallonia is hard to miss, with its bright blue storefront and sweet smell that makes you pause to appreciate it if you’re walking by. I never knew I needed a Belgian waffle shop in my life until I came here for the first time; now, I wonder why every neighborhood doesn’t have something like this. I normally go for something basic and get the Antwerp, but the Waffallonia (menu item) gets you unlimited toppings which is never a bad thing.
RAMEN BAR
Squirrel Hill is no stranger to diverse restaurant options. You can’t go wrong with any of the places you have to choose from, but my go-to always was and always will be Ramen Bar. The service is speedy and the food is absolutely delicious. It’s also right on one of the main walking strips of the neighborhood, so it’s a perfect place to people watch, especially if you get a window seat.

PAPELON AREPA BAR
Papelon Arepa Bar is serving up some of the city's finest Venezuelan cuisine from its location on Murray Avenue. It doesn't just stop there either; the restaurant has been known to frequent different festivals around Pittsburgh with food stands, like Taco Festival. The menu offers enough diversity to maximize your palette while also finding something you might be more comfortable with. There are also gluten-free options available.

DRINK

COMMONPLACE COFFEE
Speaking of people watching and my favorite places, I would go to Commonplace Coffee every day of my life if I could. The vibes, the atmosphere, some of the best tasting coffee I’ve ever had, and that’s coming from someone who normally drinks two cups a day. I always get a vanilla iced latte (even in December, don’t judge me) and cannot recommend their chocolate chip cookies enough. Commonplace Coffee is also the perfect place to go to if you need to plug in and get some work done or if you want a place to meet up with and chat with friends.

SQUIRREL HILL CAFÉ
If you’re looking for something a little more after-hours, one of my favorite spots was the Squirrel Hill Café. Not only do they have delicious bar food, the drinks are also less expensive than a lot of places in the city. I always try to sit up in the loft, although those looking to drink the night away should be cautious of the small spiral staircase connecting the loft to the ground floor.
MANOR THEATRE
One of the hidden gems of Squirrel Hill is Manor Theatre, a small movie theater complete with a cocktail bar. It’s one of the oldest independent theaters in Pittsburgh and specializes in independent and foreign films, but it doesn’t skip out on blockbusters (I know someone who saw Barbie here three times). Throughout all of the theaters I’ve been to in the area, this one has the most old school charm, which makes sense because it was designed to have the atmosphere of a country club, with a Tudor-like exterior and parlor-like lobby.

SHOP

Everything you could ever need to buy is along two streets: Murray Avenue and Forbes Avenue. Groceries, clothes, shoes, food, drinks, ice cream, medicine, records, books. Murray and Forbes have it all. A quick stroll on these adjacent roads will leave your hands and heart full. Here are some of my favorite places to shop in the area:
AVALON EXCHANGE
I have found some of the best thrifted pieces for the best prices at Avalon Exchange. With an inventory that caters to all genders and styles, the collection at Avalon has never disappointed. This store has single-handedly gotten me to participate in spring cleaning, just to clear my closet out so I can buy more from here.
RIVERSTONE BOOKS
There’s just something about a locally owned bookstore. With two locations in the Pittsburgh area, Riverstone is one of my favorite places to go. I could get lost in the shelves, enjoy hours chatting with the staff who feel more like friends and truly cherish a day spent enjoying Riverstone for what it is: a welcoming store in a welcoming neighborhood. That’s not even mentioning the events held there, from mixers to midnight book releases to book signings to everything in between.
AMAZING BOOKS AND RECORDS
Speaking of locally owned bookstores, Amazing Books and Records moved from its Downtown location to Squirrel Hill and few years back and it gave the business an oomph. As someone who frequented the store when it was Downtown, I love walking into the Squirrel Hill location because the feel of the old space has translated seamlessly into the new one. The smell of old, worn and well-loved paper mixed with the sights of aged book spines and sounds of flipping pages, Amazing Books and Records is truly the old bookstore of any book lover’s dream.

GAMES UNLIMITED
If you’re looking for a place to make your inner child happy, Games Unlimited has you covered. Name (almost, because we’re not trying to pressure them) any game and you’ll be able to pick it up there. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had friends over and picked up a new board or card game at Games Unlimited before my guests arrived.

SEE

TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE
We’d be remiss not to mention the tragedy of Oct. 27, 2018, when 11 worshippers were killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill in the nation’s deadliest attack on a local Jewish community. While the original building where the massacre happened will be torn down, its signature façade that lines Shady Avenue will remain and house a new space that will act as a synagogue, memorial and museum, the being the county’s first of its kind that addresses antisemitism. It will also have a movie theater. The new building is expected to open in mid-2026.
FRICK PARK
Calling all Mac Miller fans and those looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Frick Park is Pittsburgh's largest historic regional park, with 644 acres stretching from Point Breeze down to the Monongahela River. Visitors are invited to hike or bike the trails, take in the over 100 species of birds around Clayton Hill or visit Blue Slide Park, famous for being the namesake of Pittsburgh-born rapper Mac Miller’s debut album.

SCHENLEY PARK
If you find yourself on the other side of the neighborhood, Schenley Park sits closer to the city between Squirrel Hill, Oakland and Greenfield. With 456 acres of trails, woods and attractions, Schenley provides a picturesque view of Pittsburgh, perfect for picnics and photo opportunities. Schenley Park also hosts a variety of events throughout the year, including the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix and the Pittsburgh Race for a Cure.
