About Parks
Schenley Skating Rink
The Schenley Park Ice Skating Rink opened in 1975 and has entertained ice skaters and hockey players ever since! Located in scenic Schenley Park, the Rink offers family fun for everyone!  Join us this season as we skate in to our 50th Anniversary in January!
Opening Day for the 2025-26 Skating Season will be announced in late October 2025.
For the 2025-2026 Skating Season
300 person maximum per skating session.
Skaters must be present to purchase admission at the box office.
Parents and Guardians not wanting to skate will still be charged admission and counted in the 300 skater maximum.
Skate aids are available at all sessions except for adult only, on a first come first serve basis.
There are no exit/re-entry privileges; once you leave, you may not come back in.
When we hit maximum capacity, we close admission.
Concessions, vending and arcade games will not be available.
No outside food or drinks allowed in Rink facility. Water is the only exception.
Skate sessions are 90 minutes-no intermission.
Please keep in mind: Outdoor skating is weather dependent, as warm temperatures and lots of sunshine can deteriorate the ice. Please feel free to call the Rink at 412.422.6523 if you have questions. CitiParks will continue to post all Rink updates on social media: @CitiParksPGH on Facebook, @CitiParks on X, and @CitiParks on Instagram.
