Information on Dr. Jared Cohon Remembrances
March 17, 2024
Dear Members of the CMU Community:
As a follow up to my message yesterday regarding the passing of CMU President Emeritus Jerry Cohon, today I write to share his obituary, a beautifully rendered and moving tribute to Dr. Cohon's life and impact. This writeup also contains information on the funeral services taking place in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, March 19. I encourage you to spend a few minutes reading it and remembering Dr. Cohon.
Many of you have asked where contributions may be made in honor of Jerry and his life. Per the obituary, the family has suggested that "remembrances be made to Alumni Theater Company or to Carnegie Mellon."
As we reflect on the passing of this beloved leader, we invite you to share any reflections and remembrances to cohonremembrance@andrew.cmu.edu. We will share your reflections with the family and they may also be featured in a news story we will post in the coming days or at our on-campus memorial event, which the university will announce once a date has been identified.
Like many of you, I am saddened, but grateful for the opportunity to celebrate this wonderful man with the community that meant so much to him.
Sincerely,
Farnam Jahanian
President
Henry L. Hillman President's Chair
