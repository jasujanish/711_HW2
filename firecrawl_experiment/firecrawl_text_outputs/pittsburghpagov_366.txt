LGBTQIA+ Housing Rights Research
PghCHR signed a contract with queer, trans-led research firm Outwith Studio to look into what housing discrimination looks like in Pittsburgh for our LGBTQIA+ communities. Despite protecting sexual orientation since 1990 and gender identity and expression since 2014, the Commission sees very few complaints filed on these bases. Outwith Studio did outreach, interviews, and a survey to find out what kind of housing discrimination LGBTQIA+ people in Pittsburgh see most frequently and how it manifests, to do outreach better and serve these communities in our mission to prevent and address discrimination in Pittsburgh.
