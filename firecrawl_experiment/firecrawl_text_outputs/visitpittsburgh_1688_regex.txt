Want to get a tattoo or piercing?
Hundreds of artists will be at the Pittsburgh Tattoo Expo. for live tattooing, which you'll see as you walk around the booths. You might be tempted to get a tattoo yourself while you're there, but it might not be that simple.
If you want to get a tattoo or piercing at the Pittsburgh Tattoo Expo., you should see which artists are scheduled to be there and get in contact with them to get on their books before you go. You could luck out and ask an artist while you're walking around (which happened to me a few years back, but I was the very last person to get tattooed for the weekend), but chances are everyone is booked out. If that happens but you really love one of the artists and their style, ask them about getting an appointment outside of the expo.
What to do while waiting for your tattoo
The expo's location near Point State Park is ideal for killing time while waiting to get your next tattoo or piercing. Take a stroll down toward where the three rivers meet and get a breathtaking view of Mt. Washington and Acrisure Stadium.
You shouldn't get a tattoo on an empty stomach, so head to Market Square to get a bite from a place like Primanti Brother's, City Works or Las Velas. With it being Valentine's Day weekend, some places might be a little packed or even booked out, so we recommend trying to get a reservation or going before dinnertime.
The expo is also offering plenty of live shows through the weekend. Click here for the full schedule.
