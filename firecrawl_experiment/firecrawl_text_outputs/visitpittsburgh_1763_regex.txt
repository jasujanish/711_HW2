Pittsburgh’s Northside Music Festival
The Northside's Free Music Festival Returns July 18-20, 2025 in Deutschtown
The Deutschtown neighborhood of Pittsburgh is once again bringing a free, full weekend of live music to the Northside. This year's Northside Music Festival will be rocking with 70+ bands performing across indoor and outdoor venues during their signature three-day event. This free festival will also include art vendors and more than 20 food trucks.
This non-profit, all-volunteer music festival is one of Pittsburgh’s signature summer events and a great way to support and promote local bands and bring the Northside community together.

Three Days of Fun
The Northside Music Festival encompasses a huge swath of this booming neighborhood. Two main outdoor stages at Allegheny Commons Park and on Foreland & Middle's intersection anchor the festival, with additional venues at popular businesses on the Northside including The Government Center, Allegheny City Brewing, Allegheny Elks Lodge and Fat Cat for more live music.
Beer gardens are located at the Main Stage on Foreland as well as James Street to keep the party going and food trucks line the streets including favorites like Mi Empanada, PGH Crepes, Cilantro & Ajo, Yinzer Dog and many more!
Saturday is a great day to bring the family as Allegheny Commons East Park is taken over with inflatables, obstacle courses, face painting, tie-dying and more kid-friendly fun. Then, browse Redfishbowl's Artist Village featuring 100+ independent vendors and live painting demonstrations.
Gospel Sunday will up the fun even more July 20 from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. as the music festival adds even more family fun as well as a Gospel worship experience in the park.
