Craft Beer &amp; Bites
Beer to Pour &amp; Menus to Explore
We get it. Some nights you just want that one stop shop where you can eat, drink and enjoy—all from the comfort of one corner booth. That’s why we developed this list of five of the top microbreweries known not only for exceptional craft beer but also for their delectable bites. From brewery brunches to wood-fired pizza and burgers bursting with flavor, here are some all-in-one nights out.
Burgh'ers Brewing
Local. Approachable. Sustainable. These are words modern craft beer drinkers and foodies love to see when they need a night out. At Burgh’ers Brewing, their menu and draft list reflect this commitment, sourcing all ingredients from local farmers around the Burgh.
The experience here is decidedly unpretentious—with menus full of smashburgers named after Pittsburgh neighborhoods served with a fistful of fries that pairs perfectly with a can of their brews, which usually reference iconic Pittsburgh buildings and landmarks. Check out their locations in Lawrenceville, the South Side and Zelienople.

Strange Roots &amp; Pittsburgh Sandwich Society
Two distinct locations with two mouth-watering menus. Strange Roots, known for its sours and other experimental ales, is especially unique because all each location partners with a different restaurant.
From the savory burgs and sandwiches from Pittsburgh Sandwich Society in Millvale to inventive Common Oven Pizza Co. pizzas in New Kensington, each location offers a new night out!

Penn Brewery
Starting way back in 1986, Penn Brewery has been producing top-quality craft beer decades before microbreweries were ever a buzzword. Beers here, which vary between authentic German styles and modern incarnations, have taken home 20+ medals from the World Beer Cup and Great American Beer Festival.
Their menu features Pittsburgh favorites like pierogi (dough pockets stuffed with potatoes and cheese) and fries on your salad plus old-school staples including pork schnitzel, spaetzle and German sausages, all served up in an iconic landmark within Pittsburgh’s Deutschtown neighborhood.

Dancing Gnome &amp; Blue Sparrow
Take a 1956 Greyhound Bus, add a wood-fired pizza oven and permanently park it in front of one of Pittsburgh’s most buzzworthy breweries, and you have the winning combination of Blue Sparrow and Dancing Gnome Brewery.
Don’t be surprised to see a line wrapped around the building during new beer releases; grab some scratch made ‘za and dumplings from Blue Sparrow while you wait! Their menu is perfect to nosh on washed down with Dancing Gnomes’ hop-forward draft list.

Cinderlands
Finally, a brewery that serves brunch! Cinderlands Warehouse in the Strip District knows their audience, enticing the Sunday morning crowds of this neighborhood with fried French toast bites, huevos rancheros and a hot chicken sandwich that packs a big punch. Of course, these are best enjoyed with a bright brunch cocktail or Lil’ Cinder light lager.
Not into brunch? Their regular menu features a sprawling menu of light bites, salads, subs and sandwiches. But the real find here is the latest release of their Super Secret Burger Club where new burgers drop every Wednesday via their Instagram.
