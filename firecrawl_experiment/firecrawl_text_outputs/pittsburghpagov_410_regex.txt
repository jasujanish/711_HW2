Fees
The City may charge reasonable fees for copying as well as its actual costs for postage in fulfilling a Right to Know request. These fees are posted on the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records website.
If copying fees do not exceed five dollars, the copies and postage will be provided free of charge as a courtesy of the City of Pittsburgh.
If copying fees exceed five dollars, the fees and postage must be pre-paid before the records will be provided. The fee can be paid by check or money order payable to:
Treasurer, City of Pittsburgh
c/o Open Records Office
313 City County Building
414 Grant Street
Pittsburgh, PA 15219
If the fees associated with a right to know request are anticipated to be greater than $100.00, a deposit must be paid in advance before the City is obligated to compile the records. The City is not obligated to forward records if there is a balance due for copy costs in a previous request.
