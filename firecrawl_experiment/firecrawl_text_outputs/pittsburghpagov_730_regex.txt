Who can Request Ethics Advice?
Anyone covered by the Board’s jurisdiction can receive free advice: current and former officials and employees (and those who, although acting under contract, appear to act as government officials and employees), consultants, applicants, candidates, contributors to campaigns for City elected office, vendors, and persons and entities who do or seek business with the City (including the owners and officers of such entities, and subcontractors).
The Ethics Hearing Board may also act with respect to those who induce, encourage, or aid anyone to violate any provision of the Code, give gifts to officials and employees or their relatives, or are otherwise covered by the provisions of the Code.
Types of Advice
Informal: The Ethics Officer frequently provides informal advice through email, phone, or in-person consultations. While this guidance can help address immediate questions or concerns, it is not binding and does not extend the protections of formal advice.
Board Opinions: The Ethics Hearing Board issues formal, binding advisory opinions providing guidance that serves as a defense -- the Board will dismiss any future complaint relating to conduct in conformity with issued formal advice. The Board’s Opinions interpret the laws, regulations, and relevant precedents, ensuring clarity and compliance with the letter and spirit of the Code of Conduct.
Ethics Officer Formal Advice: The Ethics Officer is authorized to issue formal advice in response to inquiries previously addressed by a Board Opinion, and other clear areas of the law. By relying on these established sources, the Ethics Officer ensures that the advice is consistent with existing legal and ethical standards, providing clear and reliable guidance. Formal advice can often be issued with a quicker turnaround time than Board Opinions.
Valuable Gift Committee Advice: A subcommittee of the Board serves to review the propriety of gifts valued at $500 or more.
Ethics laws are complex with many defined terms, exceptions, and overlapping requirements. With all of our advice, we apply the law and regulations to help you know how these ethics rules relate to your unique situation.
