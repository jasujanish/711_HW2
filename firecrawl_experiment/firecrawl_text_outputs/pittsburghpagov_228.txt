Return to Taxes Finance Page
This sheet is designed to provide you with an estimate of your property tax bill.
The Allegheny County property reassessment will determine the values that will be used to calculate your tax bill ( assessment values can be found online). New tax millage rates have been set for the City, County and School District and tax bills will be mailed to you shortly. The City of Pittsburgh will not receive additional revenue as a result of the Allegheny County reassessment.
The following measures are meant to help you lower your tax bills:

The City's millage rate is 8.06
The Act-50 Homestead Exemption is $15,000
The Act-77 Senior Tax Relief is a 40% reduction on assessment
