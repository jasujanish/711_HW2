Architecture Inventory
The City of Pittsburgh Architectural Inventory Project is an on-going survey which identifies potential historic buildings within City neighborhoods. The surveys began in 2014 as a way to document existing architectural conditions within the City and serve as informational planning tools impacting land-use decisions regarding identified historic resources. Surveys use field data to evaluate and document properties with respect to historic patterns, building types, and themes within a neighborhood context. An example showing the various types of building attributes surveyed may be seen here: Architectural Survey Attribute Fields(PDF, 178KB).
As of 2021, the Architectural Inventory has surveyed approximately 13% of properties City-wide.
The Architectural Inventory Project for the City of Pittsburgh is made possible with funding provided by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.
