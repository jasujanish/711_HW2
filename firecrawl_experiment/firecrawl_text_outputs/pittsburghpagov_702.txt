City Of Pittsburgh Reviewing All Nonprofit Tax-Exempt Property

CITY OF PITTSBURGH REVIEWING ALL NONPROFIT TAX-EXEMPT PROPERTY
PITTSBURGH – Today the Finance department will send a Taxing Jurisdiction Exemption Challenge to the Allegheny County’s Office of Property Assessments for 26 parcels.  Included in those properties are parking lots, vacant lots, houses and office space.
“I issued an Executive Order on January 24th, and already the Law and Finance departments have identified properties that are not paying their fair share,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “The next step is for the Office of Property Assessments to review our challenges and make a determination.  We hope they will move expeditiously to make them pay.”
Since the executive order, the Law and Finance Departments have reviewed 10 percent of the exempt properties that are neither government property nor owned by churches.  This batch of challenges is due to the County by the end of the month for this taxing year, but the City will continue its review and hopes to have the review completed by next March.
The City believes that these owners do not meet the purely public charity test and/or the property does not serve a charitable purpose.  The properties that are being challenged are listed below.
