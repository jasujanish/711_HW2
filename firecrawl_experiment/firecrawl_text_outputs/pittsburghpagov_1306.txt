Make an Accommodations Request
This Request for Accommodation form was established to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as amended. The Americans with Disabilities Act is a federal civil rights law that provides people with disabilities equal access to employment, state and local government programs, goods and services. The City of Pittsburgh is committed to making programs, services, and facilities accessible to all people. Under Title II of the ADA, the City of Pittsburgh is required to ensure that our facilities, services, and programs are accessible to people with disabilities and in compliance with the ADA. The City will not place a surcharge on a particular individual with a disability or any group of individuals with disabilities to cover the cost of providing auxiliary aids/services or reasonable modifications of policy.
Alternative means of filing complaints, such as personal interviews or a tape recording of the complaint will be made available for persons with disabilities upon request.
