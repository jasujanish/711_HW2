Collection Map
The City of Pittsburgh offers collection services to promote environmentally friendly disposal of your trash, recycling, and yard debris. To know which weeks Environmental Services picks up recycling, what days we pick up yard waste, and what holidays will cause a delay in service, refer to the collection map below and pick which collection zone you reside in.
To find your collection day for recycling or refuse, please visit the PGH.ST or the City of Pittsburgh interactive map!
