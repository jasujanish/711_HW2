Launch of CMU's 2025 United Way Campaign
February 17, 2025
Dear Faculty and Staff,
One of the most meaningful ways our Carnegie Mellon Tartan community supports the Pittsburgh region is through our enduring support of the United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania.
Many families and individuals in our community — our neighbors, family members and friends — are facing significant challenges, including food and housing insecurity, financial instability, and limited access to resources for employment and life skills development.
That’s why today, addressing these urgent needs, we are launching CMU’s 2025 United Way Campaign.
I invite each of you to join us in supporting vital United Way programs that play a crucial role in providing emergency assistance, empowering individuals and families towards financial stability, and fostering the success of children and youth.
To support the campaign, please visit CMU’s United Way website. You can contribute through a one-time gift, establish a recurring payroll deduction or participate in a variety of campaign events.
I am grateful for the leadership of campaign co-chairs Jim Garrett, provost and chief academic officer, and Angela Blanton, vice president for finance and chief financial officer. Their dedication, along with the support of our hard-working campaign committee and a network of passionate champions across campus, will drive our collective efforts.
The 2025 United Way Campaign will run from February 17 to March 28. We encourage you to participate early and generously.
This United Way campaign aligns with our Strategic Plan 2025 goal of creating a positive regional impact. Let us demonstrate the power of the Tartan community. Together, we can make a meaningful difference for our neighbors who rely on the vital services provided by United Way.
Sincerely,
Farnam Jahanian
President
Henry L. Hillman President’s Chair
