Sell What You Grow
You can sell what you grow right in your own neighborhood. You will need an Outdoor Retail Sales and Service Accessory Use Permit from the Zoning department. For that, you will need a site plan that includes identifying where the market stand, customer standing area and trash receptacle will be placed to assure it does not encroach on the public right-of-way or adjacent property.
Adopt-A-Lot Market Stand Lease
In order to donate or sell uncut, unprocessed produce that you have grown on City-owned land on site, you must complete a Market Stand Lease.
