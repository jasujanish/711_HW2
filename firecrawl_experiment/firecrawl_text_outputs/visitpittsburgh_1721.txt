TBA for 2024
In the hectic rush of the holidays, it’s time to slow down, get out of your car, and stretch your legs! This Westmoreland County tradition has been operating since 1956. Enjoy this walk-through Christmas village for good, as Overly Country Christmas exists to raise money for charitable causes.
Though the Overly Country Christmas Village may not be as extravagant as some other displays on this list, it’s still worth a stroll through, especially if you’re looking to avoid the huge crowds some of the other events on this list can draw. Like any good country Christmas, Overly’s Country Christmas Village is simple and comforting. Check back for more information about the tickets for this spectacular holiday event.
