Resource
The American Wood Council's " Design for Code Acceptance #6 - Prescriptive Residential Wood Deck Construction Guide" is a valuable resource that can be used to show code compliance for residential wooden decks. This guide includes tables for sizing all structural elements including footings. The sizing for wood members are based on exposure to exterior conditions and weather treatment of certain wood species, both of which reduce structural capacity.
Note: This guide requires a minimum post size of 6 x 6.
