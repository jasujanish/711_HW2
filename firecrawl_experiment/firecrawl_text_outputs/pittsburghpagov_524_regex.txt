COVID-19 Vaccine Requirement to Protect Health and Safety of All
Published on November 01, 2021
Pittsburgh, PA (November 1, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has announced that all employees are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by December 22, 2021 in order to protect employees as well as the public they serve.
Employees will be considered fully vaccinated two weeks after a person’s second dose in a two-dose series and two weeks after a single-dose vaccine. The City will be hosting vaccine clinics for employees at city facilities to help accommodate getting the vaccinations.
“We have all been through so much over the past year and a half as we watched COVID-19 shut down our businesses, our schools and sent people to shelter in place,” said Mayor William Peduto. “The science is clear that getting the vaccine protects us from the severity of COVID and its variants that are once again filling our hospitals. Our employees provide essential public services on the front lines, interacting directly with our critical communities like seniors, youth and those experiencing emergencies. It is our responsibility to act collectively to protect both our employees and the public so that we can move on and continue our recovery from the pandemic.”
A copy of Mayor Peduto's Executive Order(PDF, 328KB) for the vaccine requirement is available.
