Recycling Contamination, and Why It Matters?
One of the biggest challenges facing recycling right now is contamination by wishful recycling or “wish-cycling”. This happens when non-recyclable objects are placed in the recycling bin with the wish it will be recycled. Additionally, recycling contamination occurs when food residue, liquids, and unacceptable materials—such as bagged recyclables, plastic bags, plastic films, plastic packaging, electronics, hazardous waste, Styrofoam, batteries, sharps, food waste, greasy pizza boxes, and other durable goods like Tupperware, storage containers, or even plastic hangers—are placed in the recycling can. Contaminants not only degrade the materials, boosting costs, but they can potentially cause harm to the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) and city employees.
