The fruits of the sea and rivers flow throughout Pittsburgh’s restaurants as delectable bites. Whether you’re craving oysters and scallops or shrimp, crab, and lobster, you’ll find that Pittsburgh culinary establishments have scrumptious solutions to your seafood dreams.
Grand Concourse Restaurant
All aboard the Grand Concourse Restaurant! Operating in a former train station, this magnificent restaurant features spectacular riverside views and a beautifully ornate interior. If you’re dining with a group, the chilled seafood tower with lobster, shrimp, oysters, and ahi tuna will keep everyone full and happy. But if you prefer having your own dish, we highly recommend the decadent seared scallops and sweet potato risotto with miso brown butter. \| Location: 100 W Station Square Dr
Muddy Waters Oyster Bar
Prepare for shucking and cracking fresh Bayou-tasting shellfish at this Cajun-themed restaurant. This New Orleans-style bar and eatery boasts live jazz, dirty martinis, and scrumptious oysters. For a hearty option, don’t pass up on the flavorsome seafood gumbo. \| Location: 130 S Highland Ave
Monterey Bay Fish Grotto
Just a short drive from attractions like the Duquesne Incline, Monterey Bay Fish Grotto is a sophisticated establishment with one-of-a-kind seafood creations.

The Original Oyster House
The Original Oyster House is the oldest restaurant and bar in Pittsburgh, operating since 1870! Here, fish sandwiches, crab cakes, clam chowder, and fish ‘n chips are timeless dishes that never go out of style. Situated by the Market Square, this fish house and tavern is the perfect casual spot to satisfy your seafood cravings. \| Location: 20 Market Square
Roland’s Seafood Grill
There’s not a better pairing to sports-watching than a beer and a plate of seafood delights. This relaxed bar is an integral part of the Strip District, serving fresh seafood to locals and newcomers alike for more than six decades. On sunnier days, we suggest dining on the patio, which overlooks the bustling Penn Avenue. Enjoy comfort food like lobster mac and cheese, or order shrimp cocktail and freshly shucked oysters from the raw bar. \| Location: 1904 Penn Ave
Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille
This cozy restaurant is anything but sleepy, boasting a vibrant sea-themed mural and flavors that pack a punch. Delectable menu options include sushi, Tuscan scallop pasta, mussels, mahi mahi tacos, and so much more. \| Location: 2106 Penn Ave

Redfin Blues
Redfin Blues is located right by the water on Herrs Island and if you pick patio seating, you’ll have up-close views of boats sailing along the Allegheny River. The lobster roll is a seafood gem that’s tossed in a roasted garlic aioli and is served on a toasted butter roll. Sit back and take in the riverside breeze as you bite into luscious textures and flavors. \| Location: 100 Waterfront Dr
Point Brugge
Make your way to this European-inspired bistro for Belgian seafood cuisine. This Point Breeze restaurant is all about using simple ingredients to their fullest, featuring moules frites (mussels with Belgian fries) and pan-seared salmon with a thyme honey glaze. \| Location: 401 Hastings St
Penn Avenue Fish Company
This combined restaurant and fish market in the Strip District is truly a seafood haven. Step inside and you’ll find a loftlike space with friendly vendors and staff. Daily catches are expertly transformed into melt-in-your-mouth sushi rolls and ranch-smoked salmon pizza. \| Location: 2208 Penn Ave

Off The Hook
Off The Hook is home to an oyster bar, an outdoor patio area, and an extensive array of seafood offerings. This Warrendale restaurant is the ultimate food coma-inducing experience, and we mean it in a good way. Lobster-whipped potatoes, jumbo sea scallops, and a trio of tuna tartar await at Off The Hook. \| Location: 908 Warrendale Village Dr

Eddie V's Prime Seafood

McCormick &amp; Schmick's Seafood Restaurant
McCormick &amp; Schmick's Seafood Restaurant is for laidback celebrations with your loved ones, whether it’s an anniversary or a weekly get-together. Flavorsome dishes with high quality ingredients are served in an inviting atmosphere. There are a variety of seafood options, but our go-to dish is the chef’s choice, the swordfish casino; the fish is grilled, topped with lump crab, red bell peppers, and bacon. \| Location: 301 Fifth Ave
