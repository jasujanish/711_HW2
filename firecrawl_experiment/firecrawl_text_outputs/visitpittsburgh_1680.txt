Places to Get Pittsburgh's Best Cocktails
For those feeling fancy...
Personally, I've always been a bigger fan of cocktails than beer. That's why, in honor of National Cocktail Month, I've highlighted some of my favorite spots to get Pittsburgh's best cocktails.
Margaux
East Liberty
A bar that doubles as a coffee shop? Yes please. Margaux in East Liberty offers the perfect blend of cocktails, appetizers, and good vibes. Inspired by the idea of hybrid European café-bar, this business offers a rotating list of cocktails and a modern and casual space for gourmands and romantics alike. There's also outdoor seating when weather permits, which somehow elevates the atmosphere even more.
My recommendation: Espresso martini. Plain and simple. It fits the vibe, it tastes great. You truly can't go wrong.

Emerson's
Downtown Pittsburgh
If you don't look up, you might miss one of Market Square's newest additions. Emerson's location tucked away off the beaten path is perfect for its intimate vibe. For how fancy this place feels, the food and drinks are affordable and delicious; I can't wait to go back the second I leave.
My recommendation: I hate to repeat, but their espresso martinis are to die for. I also always get a charcuterie board.

POETRY LOUNGE
Millvale
Now this is a bar that's right up my alley. Poetry Lounge is a literary themed cocktail/dive bar/venue for "discerning adults." Think cocktail bar quality drinks with a dive bar vibe with live music. Patrons can look forward to poetry readings, live shows, karaoke, open mic nights, pinball, and arcade games.
My recommendation: Part of their extension menu includes Pittsburgh Drinks, and I would be remise to not recommend one of those. Try the Galeophobia, complete with blueberry infused rum from Maggie's Farm, citrus, Sangria syrup, and more.
Tina's
Bloomfield
I have friends who have Tina's at the top of their list for places to drink and hang out in Pittsburgh, and I absolutely agree that it deserves to be there. This bar works to appreciate the culture and craft of cocktails without reinventing the wheel with each of their recipes. A highlight of Tina's is the affordability: at the heart of their menu is the seven for $7 selection of classic cocktails. Tina's also has wine for those looking for something simpler.
My recommendation: I asked my friends who love Tina's for their recommendations, and they said to get the Shaken Drake and Last Word, but keep in mind the menu is constantly changing.

Commerce
East Liberty
Another gem in East Liberty, this speakeasy fits the exact vibe you would expect. Hidden in an alleyway, this secret spot will have you feeling like you've discovered a jackpot. Not only are the vibes immaculate, the drinks and food will have you begging for seconds or even thirds. Commerce is one of my favorite spots in the city to grab a drink, but keep in mind its popularity; I recommend getting there early to get your name on the waitlist or calling in a reservation well in advance, especially on a weekend.
My recommendation: You have to indulge in one of this bar's most unique features. For a set price, you can tell your server your tastes, from favorite liquor to if you're craving sweet or savory, and they will create a cocktail designed specifically for you.

Bar Botanico
Lawrenceville
Located in the heart of Lawrenceville, Bar Botanico features thoughtful cocktails that often change with the seasons. Walking into this cocktail bars feels like walking through the great outdoors, with his green decor and open window (when the weather warms up, of course). The business is also heavily involved in fundraising, specifically for the Heart of
Glass Animal Rescue, and often has events where they donate money made on cocktails to the charity.
My recommendation: Each month, Bar Botanico highlights a "new feature of the month" cocktail, which varies depending on the month, the weather, and more.

Acacia
South Side
Pittsburgh's South Side is known for its bars, but if you're looking for something a little less rowdy, Acacia is the place to be. Located right along the main drag of East Carson Street, this cocktail bar is the perfect place to have a chill experience. The low lights and simple decor make the atmosphere ideal for a good cocktail and great conversation.
My recommendation: I hate to recommend an espresso martini for a third time, so I won't recommend a normal espresso martini. Acacia's take on the classic cocktail is a spin on what you would expect: Fernet Branca, St. George NOLA Coffee Liqueur, Tempus Fugit Cremè de Cacao, Angostura Bitters, House Cold Brew, Mint. It's perfect for those coffee lovers who are looking for a little something extra.

The Summit
Mt. Washington
For those looking to take in some views, The Summit is just one block away from Grandview Avenue, where you can gaze upon Pittsburgh's skyline from the top of Mt. Washington. The cocktail bar is a perfect place to enjoy your time atop the mountain before heading back down one of the city's inclines. On Wednesdays, The Summit has a featured cocktail that is happy hour price ($8) all night long; talk about a steal! The business even hosts live music and jam sessions that anyone can participate in.
My recommendation: I think The Summit has one of the best mojitos in town, and I can't get enough of their Matcha Mojita.

Space Bar
Downtown
You'll have to travel to a galaxy far, far away for these cocktails, but luckily it's still right in our backyard. Space Bar is a world class craft cocktail lounge using molecular mixology to build an advanced cocktail laboratory. The drinks take months to conceive, weeks to perfect, days to create, and seconds to love. It’s a fully immersive experience as you step aboard the sleek observation deck, where you'll see a 20 foot long "window" to outer space.
My recommendation: These cocktails are so good that I've gotten a few of the options on the menu. My favorite thus far has to be the Skywatcher, because I'm a big fan of a sweet little drink.
Not a fan of cocktails?

A friendly neighborhood Pittsburgh transplant.
Probably at book club, a local coffee shop or thrift store. Tell your pet I said hi.
