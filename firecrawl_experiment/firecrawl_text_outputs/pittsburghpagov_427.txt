The Shade Tree Commission approves recommendations to the Mayor’s office and City Council to expend funds from the Shade Tree Trust Fund to advance urban forestry initiatives.
In recognition of the value of Pittsburgh's urban trees as one of our city's greatest assets, Commissioners are tasked with making recommendations to City Government to restore and maintain the city's tree population. The Commission is dedicated to providing policy makers, City Departments, and the general public with accurate and objective information on policy issues affecting the urban forest.
