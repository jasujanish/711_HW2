Thank You \| Another Successful Year for the CMU Food Drive
January 6, 2025
Dear Members of the Carnegie Mellon Community:
We are so grateful for your collective generosity in support of our 31st Annual Food Drive. This year, our CMU community contributed the following:
Total dollars raised: $100,161.87
Total nonperishables collected (including can openers): 1,597.75 lbs.
Total can openers donated to our CMU Food Pantry: 569
Using Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank’s formula to convert pounds to dollars and adding that figure to our cash total, our grand total raised this year was an incredible $102,159.06!
Thank you to all of the staff, faculty, students, alumni and friends who contributed to this year’s drive. We are humbled by your amazing response and continued support from year to year. In fact, in the 31-year history of our drive, we’ve collected $617,143 and more than 80 tons of food to help eradicate hunger and food insecurity in our region. Your support truly makes a difference!
Thank you, again.
Sincerely,
Jim Garrett
Provost and Chief Academic Officer
