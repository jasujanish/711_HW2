Pool Fees
Pool Tags are available at open pool locations.
If you want to swim in a CitiParks pool you will need to pay a daily admission fee or purchase a pool tag.
Pool Tags
This is a great option for people who want to spend a lot of time in the water.
Pool tags must be purchased at one of our 16 open pool locations. Children 15 and under, who are City residents, are able to swim for free.
All Pool tag sales are final.  You cannot add additional tags to your membership after your purchase has been completed.
There are no refunds for pool tags. Replacements for lost or stolen tags must be purchased.
