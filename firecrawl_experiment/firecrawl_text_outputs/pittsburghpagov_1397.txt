Waste Disposal Resources
For bulky or large waste items able to be set out for curbside pick-up, please see our Environmental Services page.
For disposal of items not accepted at curbside pick-up such as construction or demolition material, tires, appliances, covered devices, etc., there’s a number of options available for each. Keeping our City clean from dumping requires that everyone does their fair share in making sure their waste is responsibly and properly disposed of.
If you are paying a private business or person to transport your waste for you, always demand they give you a receipt from the disposal facility afterwards before paying in full!
Transfer Stations
Transfer Stations authorized by Allegheny County Municipal Solid Waste Management Plan provide access for large and bulky waste disposal. Residents and businesses alike can make use of most of these services. Please contact the business beforehand to learn of cost of services, accepted times of drop off, and other necessary information.

Refrigerators
Duquesne Light’s Watt Choices program will pay you $50 to recycle that old, energy-wasting refrigerator, freezer, or AC unit and $35 per dehumidifier. Have it hauled away for free! Check terms and conditions.
Freon containing appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners at Appliance Warehouse 20 S 6th St, Pittsburgh, PA 15203, no charge to drop off, no rebate.
E-Waste
Electronic waste, also known as “covered devices” cannot be picked up curbside due to the passing of the Pennsylvania state law Covered Device Recycling Act (CDRA), which bans televisions, computers, and other electronic devices from being sent to landfills.
To learn more about proper E-Waste Disposal, please see our E-Waste Environmental Services Page.
Tires
Tires cannot be picked up curbside, but can be disposed of at our Recycling drop-off locations.
*Please note only at the East-End (2nd division), Hazelwood (3rd division), and West-End (5th division) recycling drop-off locations can accept two tires a day per resident. If tires are left at other locations that is considered illegal dumping and will be investigated.
Tires can also be self-hauled to most Transfer Stations in larger amounts.
