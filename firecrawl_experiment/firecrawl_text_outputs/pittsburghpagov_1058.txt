Task Force
The Hays Woods Task Force is chaired by Former Mayor Tom Murphy and Councilman Corey O’Connor of District 5, which includes Hays Woods. Members of the Task Force include representatives from the Departments of City Planning, City Parks, Public Works, the Office of Councilman Corey O’Connor, Friends of Hays Woods, Allegheny Land Trust, Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Baldwin Borough, and the Heinz Endowments.
The Task Force established four subcommittees to go into greater depth on the following topics:

Programming and Education
Layout, Connectivity and Environmental
Management and Organization
Development

Future Task Force meetings will begin to identify the opportunities and constraints for Hays Woods, identify some shared guiding principles and draft a scope of work for planning efforts in 2019.
