Greater Pittsburgh Festival of Books
An annual festival for book lovers, by book lovers that brings dozens of nationally renowned authors to the region.
Get ready to celebrate Pittsburgh's rich literary community and love for reading at the annual Greater Pittsburgh Festival of Books, a free event that features nationally renowned authors with ties to Pittsburgh, dozens of poets, children’s activities, book and comic stores, entertainment, publishers and more.
What to expect
There is something for everyone to enjoy at the Greater Pittsburgh Festival!
Listen to authors, writers and illustrators talk about their books. Additionally, ask questions or have your favorite author sign a copy of your current read.
Check out exhibitors, including bookstores, comic shops, publishers and literary groups that are on-site to showcase their knowledge and sell what’s hot off the press. Hear from dozens of poets throughout the day.
Bring the kids and allow them to discover the wonders of reading through children’s literature authors, hands-on activities like book making and writing in braille, and entertainment, including puppet shows and storytime sessions.
There is plenty for individuals of all ages to enjoy. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all attendees and purposefully gather a diverse variety of authors across a plethora of genres.
