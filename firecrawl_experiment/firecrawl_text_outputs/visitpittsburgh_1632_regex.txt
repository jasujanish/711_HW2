Catering Your Next Event
While all of these food trucks above can be found throughout the city at various times, you can also book many of them for your private event by inquiring directly through their website or social channels.
Bring some of the best flavors of Pittsburgh directly to you! Book the Doce Taqueria food truck for guac-on-the-go to pile on a variety of tacos and their nacho bar.

It's the easiest way to book an entire party in one call.
Also, keep an eye out for the fleet of Millie's ice cream trucks and even their tiny van, which can set up at events of any size, from quinceaÃ±eras to weddings, with their homemade ice cream (their Best Chocolate is aptly named) and sundae bars.
