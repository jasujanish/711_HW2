Welcoming Communities Network
The City of Pittsburgh's Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (OIRA) has a Welcoming Communities network of stakeholders representing service organizations, immigrant leaders, city departments and government-adjacent organizations. OIRA ensures regular communication through the monthly Welcoming Communities meetings, which offer a forum for connecting stakeholders and sharing ideas, programs, challenges, and opportunities.
If you are an individual or organization doing work to make Pittsburgh a welcoming city and would like to collaborate, please reach out to be included in our welcoming community's forum and email group. Email us at: welcomingpgh@pittsburghpa.gov.
The Welcoming Communities Network platform is made possible by partnerships with local stakeholders who know our immigrant, refugee, and asylee communities best. It’s with our partners’ support that we have been able to make strides towards making Pittsburgh a more welcoming city for all. We’d like to thank all of our partners for their support.
