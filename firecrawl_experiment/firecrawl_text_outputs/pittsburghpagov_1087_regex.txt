Safe Passage
 Safe Passage is a violence prevention program that is rooted in treating the disease of violence through a collaboration between Operation Better Block, the City of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Public Schools, and BUHL. Using a public health approach, our goal is to reduce the transmission of the disease of violence among Pittsburgh Public Schools students and their communities.
This is done through training Safe Passage Coordinators (SPCs), Youth Safety Ambassadors (SAs), and Community Stakeholders with the Safe Passage Safety Model. Collectively, they serve as violence interrupters and identify at-risk youth to help them join the peace-keeping solution.
School communities are also connected to important resources ranging from financial support to job searches.
