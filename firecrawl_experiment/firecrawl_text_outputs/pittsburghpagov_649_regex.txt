What is a City Clerk?
A City Clerk serves two main functions for their community by...
Providing a direct link between citizens and their government
Serving as an historian for the entire recorded history of city and its people
Every municipality in the United States has a City Clerk or someone who functions as one. The official functions and duties of the City Clerk are outlined further in the City Clerk Functions section of this web site. In this section, we hope to provide you with a more general view of the City Clerk's role, and the background and history of this office.
The eminent political scientist, Professor William Bennett Munro, writing in one of the first textbooks on municipal administration (1934), stated:
"No other office in municipal service has so many contacts. It serves the mayor, the city council, the city manager (when there is one), and all administrative departments without exception. All of them call upon it, almost daily, for some service or information. Its work is not spectacular, but it demands versatility, alertness, accuracy, and no end of patience. The public does not realize how many loose ends of city administration this office pulls together."
