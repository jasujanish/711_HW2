Pittsburgh Steelers History &amp; Landmarks
A trip to Pittsburgh to celebrate the Steelers isn't complete without stopping at historic landmarks for photo ops! Here are a few must-see stops we suggest adding to your itinerary:
Steelers Hall of Honor Museum
Relive 90 years of Steelers history at this incredible interactive experience right at Acrisure Stadium. Opened in 2022, the Steelers Hall of Honor gives fans a one-of-a-kind look at the team.
Diehard fans, families and general visitors will all find something new from the 50+ Hall of Honor inductees to calling your own play in the announce booth and more high energy fun as they learn about the team, the players, the coaches and the moments that define them.

The Immaculate Reception
On Dec. 23, 1972, the Pittsburgh Steelers played their first playoff game in franchise history against the Oakland Raiders. Just as the clock ran out, fullback Franco Harris scooped up the ball and ran for a touchdown that will forever be known as the Immaculate Reception. You can visit the memorial of this historic play in the exact spot where it happened on the site of the old Three Rivers Stadium near Acrisure Stadium.
BONUS: If you’re flying into Pittsburgh International Airport, be sure to check out the Franco Harris Immaculate Reception statue for the perfect Pittsburgh photo op, now located in the Landside Terminal (no ticket needed).

Take a Photo with The Chief
True Steelers fans know that a trip to Pittsburgh wouldn’t be complete without stopping for a photo with Steelers founder, Art Rooney, Sr. The Chief watches over Acrisure Stadium as a bronze statue holding his trademark cigar and has plenty of room for photos!

Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at Heinz History Center
Discover the history behind the Steelers dynasty at the Heinz History Center! Holding the title of Pennsylvania’s largest History Museum, the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum is located on the Heinz History Center’s second and third floors, celebrating Western Pennsylvania’s unsurpassed sports legacy.

Steelers Trivia
Here are some of our favorite Steelers facts for your next trivia night:

Created by Steelers radio broadcaster, Myron Cope in 1975, the Terrible Towel is easily one of the most recognized symbols in the NFL and waving it during games has become a revered tradition. Steelers Tip: The Towel is for waving or decorating, not for drying your hands or using for any other towel-like purpose, which is believed to bring back luck.
Sometime during the fourth quarter before a big play or series, the song Renegade by Styx resonates throughout Heinz Field. Playing the song is a tradition that's equally important for fans as it is for players and represents Pittsburgh's defensive strength in the fourth quarter. The tradition dates back to a 2002 comeback win against the Cleveland Browns.
Make sure to visit the FedEx Great Hall inside Heinz Field; it's basically a shrine to the greatest moments in football history with Super Bowl trophies, jerseys, rings and more on display.
In Pittsburgh, Big Ben was our 2x Super Bowl-winning quarterback, not a clock.
Steelers aren't just inventive in their get-up, we also like to give incredible moments in football nicknames like The Immaculate Reception, The Steel Curtain, and, most recently in honor of six Super Bowl Championships, Sixburgh.
While it's widely known that the Steelers are named for Pittsburgh's rich steel history, few recognize the meaning behind the logo "Link to Steelers logo history"). Each of the hypocycloids represent one of the three materials used to make steel. Yellow represents coal, red is for iron ore, and steel scrape is illustrated with blue.
During games, you'll hear fans chanting "Here We Go, Steelers!" While it seems like a simple chant, there's some history behind this one too. Here We Go, originally written by Rodger Wood and recorded in 1994, was and still is intended as a Steelers fight song. Having sold more than 120,000 copies of the original, Here We Go is now regularly updated to mention current players' names and has become an anthem for the team during playoffs.
Whether you're visiting for a game or just happen to be around the city during football season, you're sure to enjoy the unique Steelers atmosphere. To get a full taste of the football culture here in the 'Burgh, I encourage you head to Acrisure Stadium for a game or at least visit Stage AE for a free tailgate open before, during, and after home games. Plus, you can sign up for Steelers Nation Unite to earn exclusive rewards near and far from Pittsburgh.
