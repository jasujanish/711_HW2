Pittsburgh Tailgate Traditions
DISCLAIMER: PARTICIPATING IN ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES MAY RESULT IN LEAVING WITH FRIENDS, WHETHER YOU ARRIVED WITH THEM OR NOT.
Fall foliage, football and food—what could be better? Join Steelers Nation at Acrisure Stadium for a one-of-a-kind experience cheering on the Pittsburgh Steelers and marvel in some of the city’s most treasured tailgate traditions.
Hop on The Burgh Bus
Hitch a ride to the game on The Burgh Bus! Hop on this unique opportunity to enjoy the city’s fall foliage and learn about the city with a humorous spin. Pittsburgh's four-time Best Comedian (and ultimate yinzer) Matt Light will guide you on an unforgettable journey all through the 'tahn.
The Terrible Tour runs during football season with games, dancing, lots of towel twirling and plenty of jokes about Cleveland—plus, it’s BYOB! Beyond the Terrible Tour, The Burgh Bus offers a variety of other tours year-round, and you can even rent it for private parties.

Wet Your Whistle
I.C. Light embodies all things black and gold. Pittsburgh Brewing Co. brews a variety of other options as well from flavorful spins on a classic like I.C. Mango and the full-bodied original Iron City Beer to innovative new craft offerings. Pittsburgh’s oldest brewery is also one of its newest, with a new state-of-the-art brewing facility just 20 miles north of where the three rivers meet.
Every seasoned Steelers tailgater knows that the perfect game day cooler isn’t complete without Turner’s Iced Tea. Celebrating 50 years, one sip of a Turner's product is enough to turn anyone into a lifelong fan.
Bypass the parking lot to pregame from the comfort of a stool at Mike’s Beer Bar or North Shore Tavern, with more than 500 beers and 80 local taps and famously known for Steak on a Stone. Whether you choose to sit in the restaurant or the bar, you’ll find a great atmosphere perfect for before, during and after the game!

Sports Lover Paradise
Beyond the games, there are plenty of opportunities to get your fill of Pittsburgh football history.
Relive 90 years of Steelers history with interactive exhibits at the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum. The new installation features nearly 50 Hall of Honor inductees across 10,000 square feet of Acrisure Stadium.
Continue down Art Rooney Avenue and turn right onto West General Robinson Street for maybe the most iconic sports memorial anywhere. The Immaculate Reception Monument remembers the greatest NFL play of all time, signifying the exact spot of this miraculous catch with a bronze plate featuring the footprint of Franco Harris, who made the astounding play.
