Shopping the Market
With construction in Market Square, the Alpine-style wooden chalet stands will fill the streets of the Cultural District for the 2025 season. Inspired by the original German Christkindlmarkts (or "Christmas Market"), the Peoples Gas Holiday Market™ brings a cherished European tradition to Pittsburgh. Now considered a Pittsburgh institution, the expanded market brings together global artisans and local makers to showcase their one-of-a-kind wares to fill the stockings on your list.
You can also shop local vendors via the Merry Marketplace on weekends, including fragrances by Gamimi The Brand, pet gear by Kin of Duncan and gemstone jewelry by You Can Call Me YOKO.
There are also dozens of returning favorites, including traditional vendors such as Käthe Wohlfahrt and Euro Haus; globally diverse vendors including Bali Made, PachaMama Divine Connection and Women of the Cloud Forest; as well as local artisans and makers such as Vessel Studio Glass, strawberryluna, Worker Bird, Garbella and KLoRebel Art Co.
Visitors to the Peoples Gas Holiday Market will be able to munch on tasty pastries from Helmut’s Strudel, delicious chestnuts and roasted nuts from CinnaRoast, or tantalize their sweet tooth with gourmet fudge and truffles from Copper Coast Confections. Need a pick-me-up? Grab a cup of Irish tea or coffee and a scone from the Celtic Gift Shoppe by the Pittsburgh Irish Festival.
The Peoples Gas Holiday Market™ is scheduled to open this year on Friday, Nov. 21, and will remain open through Dec. 24 (closed Thanksgiving). Kickoff the season at the 64th annual Highmark Light Up Night Saturday, Nov. 22, 2025 in Downtown Pittsburgh.
