Prevailing Wage
In the spring of 2010, the City of Pittsburgh enacted the Service Worker Prevailing Wage Ordinance to require projects subsidized by public monies to pay wages that reflect local rates.
The Prevailing Wage is based on studying local wage conditions and three sources of rate information: Bureau of Labor Statistics Market Rates, local Collective Bargaining Agreement Rates, and McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act Rates. Prevailing wage rates for Building Service(PDF, 229KB) , Food Service(PDF, 253KB), Grocery Workers(PDF, 208KB), and Hotel Workers(PDF, 195KB)  are determined by the Controller’s Office.
In accordance with the Pittsburgh City Code, the Mayor’s Office of Equal Protection monitors City contractors’ compliance with prevailing wage requirements in building and food services and grocery and hotel projects with City contracts or subsidies over $100,000.
This website provides resources regarding the Prevailing Wage, including links to the Ordinance and Guidelines, Complaint Form, and FAQ. Please check this website for updates.
