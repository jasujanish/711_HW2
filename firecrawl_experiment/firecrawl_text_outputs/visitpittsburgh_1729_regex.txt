Oakland: Neighborhood Guide
Pittsburgh's university town is home to prestigious universities, hospitals and more than 40 world-class museums, theaters, cultural and entertainment destinations. As a student who has called this place home for the past couple of years, I’m going to walk you through the can’t-miss activities and food and drink of Oakland, even if you're not a Pitt Panther!

Best On Campus Eats
Tucked within Pitt’s main university buildings are a number of restaurants that are perfect if you need to fuel up while on campus. Be sure to check their operating hours as they follow university schedules. Some top picks include:
Ft. Pitt Subs in the William Pitt Union
The Roost and Pom & Honey in the basement of the Cathedral of Learning
Shake Smart, Burrito Bowl, and Chick-fil-A inside the Petersen Events Center
Best Off Campus Eats
The best part of going to a city school is there’s no shortage of food options when the dining hall just isn’t cutting it anymore. Forbes is lined with restaurant after restaurant to satisfy any craving. Atarashi and JJ Poke’s poke bowls have me in a chokehold and Pamela’s is hands down the best spot for breakfast.
Fill up on your comforts like Chipotle, Panera, Dunkin, or Five Guys or grab a bite from Schenley Plaza’s inconspicuous, but delicious Asian, KBBQ, Hillel, and Gelato gazebos. Asia Tea House has great boba and generous portions. If the rents are in town, you can’t miss an artisan pizza from The Porch or a loaded burger from Stack’d.

Late Night Munchies
Food is almost the best part of a night out and these late night spots are a staple to every college student’s experience. You can never go wrong with some pizza at 1am and Pizza Romanos, Antoons, or Pizza Bellagio has you covered. Expect to make friends with the most random people while waiting for your pizza.
Experiencing a Frenchi’s #1 wrap is a rite of passage for any college student - and who knows, you might even get featured on their Instagram! Open 24/7, PileZ has all your comfort foods as well as the iconic “garbage plate”, a Rochester specialty consisting of hot dog, hamburger meat, fries, macaroni salad, meat sauce, onions, mustard, and ketchup.

Best Places to Reconnect with Nature
Though Oakland is located in the city, there are so many green spots to enjoy the outdoors. For a sunset picnic and an iconic view of the Cathedral of Learning, head to Flagstaff Hill. Across the street is the well known Phipps Conservatory, but did you know that admission is free for Pitt and La Roche students with a valid student ID? Mission impossible: see if you can make it through college without going on a first date here. Schenley Plaza is the perfect place to photosynthesize or lounge in a hammock and soak up the sunshine after a Pittsburgh winter.

Who’s Cathy?
The Cathedral of Learning, fondly known as Cathy, is Oakland’s pride and joy. Standing at 535 feet tall, she’s Oakland’s north star and offers panoramic views of the city. Just ride up to the Honors College on the 36th floor for a quiet place to study or to admire the view.
Best Spots for a Thursday/Happy Hour
In a town full of college students, it goes without saying that Thirsty Thursday is a well celebrated night. Hemingways is a popular sit down spot for a Thursday pitcher of your choice cocktail (the bikini bottom is my go-to!) as well as Viva for their happy hour frozen margaritas. Union Grill also offers an affordable late night happy hour menu - who doesn’t love a $4 mule?!
Phat’s karaoke night always has a line for days on Thursdays, so it’s best to get there on the earlier side. Across the street is Boots, another popular Thursday bar that has pool tables and darts. Gene’s Place is a small dive bar that always attracts a crowd. Whatever vibe you’re looking for, Oakland promises you a good night!
