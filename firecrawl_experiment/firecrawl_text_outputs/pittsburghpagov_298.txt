ADA &amp; Disability Rights

The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, and other laws ensure freedom from discrimination on the basis of disability in employment and provision of government services. The Mayorâ€™s Office of Equal Protection ensures City compliance with these laws and works to make Pittsburgh accessible to all people, inclusive of their disabilities.
