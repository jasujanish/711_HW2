A 1,096-acre county park lying mostly in Plum, Boyce Park is a nature lover's paradise. Enjoy a drive-in movie, cool off at the wave pool, and take to the trails for some hiking. There's plenty of space to enjoy playing some sports yourself, including basketball, tennis, soccer, and more. And if you're a fan of Boyce Park in the summertime, you have to come back when the weather gets cold again; the park's skiing, snowboarding, and snow tubing options are some of the best around.
Stoney Creek Golf Center
Get ready for some family-friendly fun! Stoney Creek Golf Centers offers a driving range and mini golf course for put-perfectionists of all ages. There's also a pro shop on site that's a must-stop before heading to Oakmont for the U.S. Open.

Frankstown Wood Fired Pizza
Frankstown Wood Fired Pizza is a simple place with a simple premise: pizza piled with tasty toppings. Of course, they offer other items like hoagies and deli salads for those looking to peel away from the pie, but we cannot recommend getting their pizza enough. Keep in mind that this restaurant is cash only and it's recommended you call your order in ahead of time.

Pasqualino's Italian Restaurant
Pasqualino's Italian Restaurant was founded in 1971 by the Pasqualino family as Pizza Palace, and that pride in their Southern Italian roots can be felt in every sniff and every bite into each dish. The pastas are either handmade or imported from Italy, the butcher is a third-generation family-owned business, the olive oil is sourced from a family-owned California oilery, and the chicken is Humane Certified, all- natural, antibiotic free, steroid free, cage free, all vegetarian diet, locally sourced from small, family farms. The dedication to "clean" food is evident around every corner and it reflects in the taste of the dishes and quality of the restaurant.
