Clean and Lien
Once a property owner has been notified of an overgrowth or debris violation and does not bring the property into compliance, the City of Pittsburgh reserves the right to enter onto the property and take the necessary steps to remove the weeds or debris and place a lien on the property. This is referred to as a “clean and lien”.
The Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections issues the order to the Department of Public Works after the third and final inspection of a property. Once Public Works receives the order, they send a crew out to clean up the property.
If you have received a letter in the mail stating the City has placed a lien on your property, please contact the Finance Department at 412-255-2582 to discuss payment options.
If you believe this lien has occurred in error, please contact the Law Department at 412-255-2010.
