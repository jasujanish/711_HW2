How is the yearly paving list created?
Criteria for Street Selection
The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) works with community groups, council members, and 311 to identify potential issues in the right-of-way regarding street surface conditions. DOMI's staff and engineers create a yearly list based of off the following criteria:

Street Overall Condition Index (OCI) - Every street in Pittsburgh has an OCI score based upon the physical condition. Once the condition of the street deteriorates past a certain threshold it is given additional priority on the yearly paving list.
Street Use - Streets are broken into three categories: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary. Primary roads receive the most use, which results in their OCI score dropping more quickly than Secondary or Tertiary.
Equity - We apply this metric to the paving list to ensure that tax dollars are applied in a fair and impartial way so that streets in neighborhoods with a higher need receive an increase in their OCI score.
