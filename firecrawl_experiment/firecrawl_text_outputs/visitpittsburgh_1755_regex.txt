Barrel & Flow
As the first brew fest dedicated to Black brewers, drinkers and artists, Barrel & Flow Fest has put Pittsburgh on the Black brew map, and has helped position the city as one of the leaders in brewery diversity and inclusion.
Barrel & Flow Fest
What's with the name? Well, the Barrel refers to the brews and Flow references the performing artists and speakers. Together, Barrel & Flow represents what attendees can expect at the event: one-of-a-kind brews fresh from the barrel accompanied by live art, food vendors and entertainment all day.
This year, festivities will take place at The Stacks at 3 Crossings in the Strip District, where festival goers can enjoy exclusive craft brew collaborations, a uniquely curated collection of vendors, live music and entertainment, networking opportunities and plenty of fun. The festival is open from noon-9 p.m. Saturday for general admission and will feature more than 150 vendors.

Only 250 VIP tickets are available, and provide admission to all events Friday through Sunday and includes the conferencing events, bottle share, fest + catered luncheon by Roux Orleans and Sunday brunch.
