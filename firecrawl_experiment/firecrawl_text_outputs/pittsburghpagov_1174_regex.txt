Nighttime Economy
 The Office of Nighttime Economy (ONE) is the primary liaison between hospitality and nightlife businesses, their surrounding community groups and residents, and other City of Pittsburgh departments.
As part of a Sociable City Plan, the office was created in 2013 to address the complex issues required to sustain a safe and vibrant social experience for residents and visitors.
Vision
Safe and vibrant places to socialize for visitors and Pittsburghers of all ages, cultures and lifestyles.
Mission
To retain and grow the value of the social and nighttime economy; encourage safe operations of food, beverage and entertainment businesses; and facilitate collaborative co-existence with communities in which they operate.
Pittsburgh’s burgeoning hospitality scene is a vital component to Pittsburgh’s economy – employing nearly 60,000 workers in our region and generating millions in city revenue.
This office works to support not just the nighttime economy but “life at night” – including many Pittsburghers who work, play and live their lives outside of a 9-5 schedule (Think of industries like healthcare, hotels, Fedex, Amazon, Airport employees, janitorial workers, security and more.)
