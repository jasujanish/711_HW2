Community Engagement
The Office of Community Health &amp; Safety community engagement team seeks to build relationships and trust between the office and diverse communities in the City of Pittsburgh while leveraging best practices in community outreach and community engagement. Staff will accomplish their mission by developing programs and other initiatives in partnership with the community to enhance the quality of life, safety, and security of our community. The community engagement team regularly attends harm reduction resource pop-ups across the city, providing crucial information and support to community members and stakeholders.
