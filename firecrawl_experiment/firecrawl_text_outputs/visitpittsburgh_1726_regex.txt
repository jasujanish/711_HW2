Tech-Infused Fun for the Whole Fam
The modern Pittsburgh has traded in its steel mills of the past, revolutionizing itself as a tech hub for global corporations, exciting start-ups and a rapidly growing robotics and aerospace industry.
Pittsburgh is now home to the popular language learning app Duolingo, private space company Astrobotic, and is where Google and Meta are doing some of their most cutting-edge development.

Moonshot Museum
When you visit Pittsburgh, you'll find that tech pops up in surprising ways across the city, elevating experiences and taking your visit out of this world. Here are just a few places to upload to your family’s itinerary.
Moonshot Museum
Pittsburgh, we have liftoff. At Moonshot Museum, hands-on interaction is encouraged with exhibits that explore a variety of careers in the space industry. You’ll design your own mission patch, answer tough questions about how to make your colony, engineer the perfect rover and more.
During your visit, you can also watch in real-time as lunar spacecraft are assembled by Astrobotic before they begin their journey to the Moon.

Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center
But why stop at the Moon? Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center takes you on an immersive journey to the red planet with their Mars: The Next Giant Leap permanent exhibit.
This 7,400-square-foot exhibit not only lets kids get hands-on with rovers they can drive around themselves, it also challenges older learners with bigger questions of how human settlements could govern themselves and how climate concerns can be viewed both from Earth and Mars viewpoints. Add in SpacePlace and the Robot Hall of Fame, and this museum is positively packed with extraorbital fun.

Puttshack
You’ve never played a round of mini golf quite like this. Switch out the tiny pencils and scorecards for a tech-infused ball that keeps track of each stroke, freeing parents up to enjoy a signature cocktail as you play alongside your kiddos.
Each Puttshack course features nine holes of varying complexity with hazards, bonus points and puzzles to solve as you try to outscore your opponents and master each one. With multiple courses to try out, a full menu and innovative drink specials, this is an all-in-one stop for a great family night out.
Kura Revolving Sushi Bar
This newly opened restaurant has integrated tech into every part of the dining process, with innovative ordering to snag exactly what sushi plates you want and a simple system that both disposes of empty plates and tabulates your bill at the same time. But the real standout at Kura is Kur-B the Kurabot, a friendly robot that delivers drinks right to your table throughout your dining experience.

Sandbox VR
Yeah, playing video games is fun. But what if you could enter the game itself? Suit up and get in the game with immersive, full-body VR for you up to five guests as you explore and interact with diverse worlds from fantasy and sci-fi to horror, nautical and more at Sandbox VR.
Work together and conquer zombie hordes or betray your frenemies to survive. Every move is displayed via motion capture, body trackers and haptic suits.
