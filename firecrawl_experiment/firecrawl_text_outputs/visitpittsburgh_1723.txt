Just announced! The Frick Pittsburgh’s Clayton—also known as the Frick Mansion—has redefined what it means to explore history with its newly reinterpreted tour, Gilded, Not Golden.
Recently honored with a 2024 Leadership in History Award from the American Association for State and Local History, this tour is a must-see for anyone interested in diving deep into the complex stories of Pittsburgh’s past.
Why "Gilded, Not Golden"?
The Gilded Age was a time of immense wealth, industrial growth, and social change. But beyond the opulence and glamour often associated with the period, there were also profound struggles—unprecedented immigration, labor unrest, and the rapid expansion of industry. Gilded, Not Golden peels back the layers of this storied era, revealing the complex truths beneath the surface.
During this 75-minute guided experience, you will journey through Clayton, the only fully preserved Gilded Age mansion in Pittsburgh. Through a shared dialogue, explore the industrial powerhouse that Pittsburgh was, and engage in conversations about how the legacies of this transformative time continue to shape our world today.
A New Kind of Tour Experience
Tours are offered Tuesdays through Sundays, starting at 10:15 AM, and are designed for visitors aged 9 and up. What makes Gilded, Not Golden truly unique is its approach: it's not just about looking at beautiful rooms filled with period furnishings. Instead, this tour encourages an open and thoughtful exchange of ideas among guests, delving into the personal stories of the Frick family and other Pittsburghers who lived through the highs and lows of the Gilded Age. Content advisory: The year 1892 was particularly tumultuous for the Frick family and the Pittsburgh steel industry.
