Day 1 \| Go Exploring
Dive into a day of exploration in the Steel City, experiencing Pittsburgh from aerial, water and land views. By the end of the day, you might just consider yourself a Pittsburgh expert with these varied vantage points.
Start your day aboard the Gateway Clipper Fleet for outdoor fun on the water. Cruise along Pittsburgh's iconic three rivers, choosing from themed riverboat cruises or classic sightseeing tours. It's a delightful way to enjoy some family fun while taking in the scenic views of the city!
After taking in the views from the water, hop on one of Pittsburgh's famed inclines for a fantastic view of the city. As you ascend, relish the breathtaking skyline, and upon reaching the top, you'll be greeted by an unparalleled vista from Mount Washington—a must-see family selfie stop in Pittsburgh! For a laid-back meal after your Mount Washington explorations, swing by Bigham Tavern. It's an excellent spot to sit down with the family for a quick and delicious bite.
Add to your first day a delightful live show that the whole family can enjoy. The Children's Theater Series , Bridge Theater Series and EQT Children’s Theater Festival are all back, offering amazing experiences for kids of all ages. It’s a family-friendly activity everyone will enjoy.

Day 2 \| Recreation, Museums & More
Today is all about diving deeper into the authentic Pittsburgh experience. Wander through the vibrant Strip District. Catch a thrilling game. Relish the open streets of Pittsburgh and perhaps pick up a fact or two about the fascinating world of trolleys!
Start your day off right with a delicious breakfast at one of our popular diners. Kelly O’s, Pamela’s and Deluca’s, all situated in the lively and easily walkable Strip District, are sure to satisfy your family’s morning cravings.
After savoring your breakfast and strolling through the Strip’s array of local stores, head over to Highmark Stadium in Station Square for a Riverhounds soccer game. The whole family is sure to be enthralled by the excitement.
Ready to get active and get in on the action of the city? Thanks to Open Streets PGH, you can experience some pretty rare spots that even true Yinzers don’t get to see everyday. Rent some bikes or lace up your comfortable walking shoes for a show-stopping city adventure.
If you've still got some energy, take a short drive to Washington, PA and explore the Trolley Museum. The car ride can be the perfect opportunity for the kiddos to nap. Once you arrive, experience the museum’s interactive exhibits and marvel in its incredible collection. It’s the perfect educational addition to your trip.

Day 3 \| Games Galore
If you are in town for a long-weekend, what better way to cap your trip than Sunday Kids Day with the Pirates at PNC Park? Start your day with pregame fun at the Family Fun Zone. Snag some giveaway items, and perhaps cap it off by letting the little ones run the bases on the field after the game. It's an experience they'll be talking about non-stop!
While on the North Shore, make sure to swing by the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum. Explore the stories of the football players that make us proud yinzers and discover what earned them a spot in this cool museum.
Conclude this action-packed day with a visit to Shorty’s Pins x Pints. The Northside location offers duckpin bowling, bocce ball and shuffle ball to keep the fun times rolling! With a menu full of shareable delights like tacos, wings and dips, there's something for everyone (even the pickiest of eaters) to enjoy.
