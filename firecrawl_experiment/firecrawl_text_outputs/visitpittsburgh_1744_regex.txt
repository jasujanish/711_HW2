10 Repurposed Pittsburgh Churches that are #Blessed
Can we get an Amen for incredible architecture getting new life?
Pittsburghers love to give directions based on where things used to be (just turn left dahn at the old Hills!) In the same (holy) spirit, we looked across the city to find where former houses of worship have found a new purpose by becoming arts collectives, live music venues, stunning event spaces and more.
Join us as we explore the recent trend of repurposed churches bringing music, joy and creativity to Pittsburgh.
Mr. Smalls
Once a place you could only hear organ music on Sundays, Mr. Smalls took over the former St. Ann's Catholic Church (built in 1924) and has been bringing live music of all genres to the Millvale neighborhood since 2002. This unique concert space has audiophile-approved acoustics thanks to 40-foot ceilings and stained glass windows covered with sound paneling. You can stand on the main floor or watch from seats surrounding the second floor, but there's not a bad view from anywhere in this venue.
With a capacity under 1,000, this venue is perfect for both emerging artists as well as national touring musicians to play, and the intimate setting makes for a deeply personal experience with the music and your fellow concertgoers I don't find anywhere else (RIP Altar Bar). In their 20+ years of operation, Smalls has hosted Fall Out Boy, Snoop Dogg, Kesha, Interpol and All That Remains, among many others, that have gone on to music superstar acclaim.

Church Brew Works
St. John the Baptist Church in Lawrenceville laid its cornerstone in 1902. 91 years later, it was vacant and in need of a new owner. After three painstaking years of getting every detail perfect, The Church Brew Works opened to the public. Back in 1996, brewpubs were still a unique idea but with a fantastic beer selection, expansive menu and one-of-a-kind look, the microbrewery quickly found a foothold among Pittsburghers that continues to this day.
Beer is brewed right up on the altar with gleaming equipment taking center stage as the focal point during your visit. Hand-crafted brews like their German Style Pilsner and British Special Bitter plus wide-ranging food options from pierogies to Bavarian cauliflower hearkens back to and honors Pittsurgh's multitude of cultures that came together in this unique neighborhood.
The Priory
A Pittsburgh landmark, event space and history museum all in one, The Grand Hall at the Priory is among the most beautiful wedding venues in the city. It's also one of the oldest churches on this list, built in 1854 as St. Mary's German Catholic Church on the Northside.
One step in and guests are instantly wowed by the gold-leaf columns, shining organ pipes, stained glass, arches and incredible ceiling designs that make this a top spot on The Knot each year for both receptions and ceremonies. Next door, you can stay at The Priory, a former Benedictine monastery turned posh European-style hotel that makes booking accommodations for your wedding party and overnighting guests as easy as it gets.

Dragon's Den
A 160-ft zipline through a church?! That's the thrill of Dragon's Den, a non-profit that works with both youth their families through their challenge course they designed entirely within the historic St. Mary Magdalene Church. The lower level ropes course is for kids as young as five and the upper course for ages 10+, all with the goal of instilling confidence in themselves and joy to all who participate.

This is Red
Just a few blocks away from Dragon's Den in Munhall, St. Michael's Slovakian Roman Catholic has also been resurrected into the studio/event space/concert venue This is Red. Highlights of this venue include an intricate rose window on the outside, an exciting second life for the original Brinkerhoff piano and mural-covered Grotto which all combines into perfect ambiance for an event to be remembered.
Bonus Stop: It's a bit outside of the city in New Kensington, but Preserving is another former church-turned-music venue that focuses specifically on the hardcore music scene, with a record store right by it.

Oh happy Monday morning. What a great time we had over the weekend at @maplehousefest watching the coolest bands and hanging with the nicest people, now it’s time for a proper breakfast with our century old Brinkerhoff piano #amazingclients #musiciseverything

Mary's Vine
Mary's Vine in Rankin is a toast to the Blessed Virgin Mary Catholic Church it was built within. This upscale wine lounge boasts one of the best wine cellars in the city their sommelier is happy to pair with their famous crab cakes or decadent desserts. Looks for live jazz music and wine appreciation events on select nights, and be sure to make reservations to The Study as well. This cigar bar stocks all your favorites which you can puff in a leather chair surrounded by bookshelves.
Steel City Arts Foundation
Comedian, author and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Steve Hofstetter is realizing his goal of making the world a better place for artists by reimagining two Pittsburgh churches. Steel City AF (that stands for Arts Foundation 😉) began at Stanton Heights United Methodist Church as a place to house comedians free-of-charge as they hone their craft with a podcast and recording studio and digital showroom on the lower levels.
As if this only-of-its-kind comedy incubator wasn't enough, Hofstetter has recently opened Sunken Bus Studios (also a former church) in Ross Township to expand Steel City AF into for-profit ventures including a comedy club and film production studio. Keep an eye on this one; the amazing things happening here are only getting started.

The Novelty Collective
While still closely tied to religion, Brittany Hartman's vision for Greenstone United Methodist Church is to restore the connection of the church and the arts through the innovative programming of The Novelty Collective. This involves an afterschool program, open studios where anyone in the community can drop in on the 4th Saturday of each month, and their Home of the Nomads program for artists-in-residence to stay and realize their dreams.
Studio space at this Avalon-based art center ranges from painting, drawing and fashion design to a recording studio, photography and even LEGO, giving artists a myriad of ways to express themselves. Be sure to attend NoCo Fest, open to the public, their biggest event of the year and the best time to see all of inspiring ways they connect art back to worship.

Better for Having Been 𝘛𝘖𝘎𝘌𝘛𝘏𝘌𝘙
𝘊𝘰𝘭𝘭𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 has always been at the core of what we’re about.
We simply make space for
…bands to borrow members from other projects…
…artists to sit at one another’s tables & share tricks of the trade…
…long distance friends to visit & support each other...
^ These are just some of the things that make our gatherings special & build momentum that takes the Collective far beyond us >

Union Project
Community is at the heart of the Union Project, a shared art studio and educational space that fosters connections and collaborations. This Highland Park business, formerly the Second United Presbyterian Church, now has an indoor ceramics studio, outdoor kiln, classroom space and more to achieve their mission. They even have a Wheel Mobile to bring clay artistry to your next festival or event!

Church Recording Studio
Since the medieval period, churches have been built with sound quality in mind, ensuring the message from priests and pastors along with the beautiful music can be heard by all parishioners. Overbrook Presbyterian Church's new lease on life as The Church Recording Studio uses this to its advantage, with vaulted ceilings, wooden floors and vintage instruments to give your track just the sound you need. Expert mixing and mastering services are also available from their staff.
