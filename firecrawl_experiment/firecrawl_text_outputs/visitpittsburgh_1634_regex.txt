How to get to Acrisure Stadium
Public Transportation
Since parking on the North Shore near the stadium is reserved and pre-sold, it's often easier to park and ride to the stadium using other options. Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) offers light rail service on the T and city buses for fans coming from Downtown Pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. You can find more information on how to get to the stadium on the PRT website.
Riverboat Shuttles
The Gateway Clipper also offers gameday riverboat rides to the stadium and is my personal favorite way to get to the game. Park at Station Square, grab your tickets and enjoy your ride around the Point with raucous, fun-loving fans before getting dropped off right at the stadium. Find more information about riverboat shuttles here.

Where’s the best place to tailgate before a Steelers game?

The parking lots open five hours prior to kick-off and you can find more tailgating information and regulations here.
If you want to tailgate but don't have a group to join up with, the Stage AE Tailgate Zone is perfect for you! Admission is free, and the event has live music, giant TVs, food and drink specials, along with prizes and autographed items you can win.
Where to Eat near Acrisure Stadium?

Don't Forget to Brush Up On Your Pittsburgh Steelers Trivia
What is The Terrible Towel?
Created by Steelers radio broadcaster, Myron Cope in 1975, the Terrible Towel is easily one of the most recognizable symbols in the NFL and waving it during games has become a revered tradition. Towels can be purchased in stadium or at sports stores around the North Shore.
What is the song played during the fourth quarter?
When the Steelers need a big stop in the fourth quarter, the song Renegade by Styx resonates throughout Acrisure Stadium. Playing the song is a tradition that's equally important for fans as it is for players and represents Pittsburgh's defensive strength in the fourth quarter.
What’s the meaning behind the Steelers logo?
While it's widely known that the Steelers are named for Pittsburgh's rich steel history, few recognize the meaning behind the logo. Each of the hypocycloids represents one of the three materials used to make steel. Yellow represents coal, red is for iron ore and steel scrape is illustrated with blue.
Why do Steelers fans chant “Here We Go Steelers?”
During games, you'll hear fans chanting "Here We Go, Steelers!" While it seems like a simple chant, there's some history behind this one too. “Here We Go,” originally written by Rodger Wood and recorded in 1994, was and still is intended as a Steelers fight song.
