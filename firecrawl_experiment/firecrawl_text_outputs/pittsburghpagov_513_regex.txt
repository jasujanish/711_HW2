Councilperson Bob Charland
The son of a lifelong Teamster and a healthcare worker, Bob learned growing up the value of hard work and cooperation. Bob took those lessons to heart, dedicated his career to working alongside our neighbors to build a strong future for the 3rd Council District and the City of Pittsburgh.
For the last five years, Bob has worked for Pittsburgh City Council to bring the needs of our neighbors to Grant St, and bring the services we need back to our neighborhoods. In that role, Bob worked to create safer, cleaner neighborhoods, using strategies from traffic calming to demolishing unsafe buildings to bringing homeless services to the district.
Bob is proud to live in the South Side Flats among neighbors who have become friends.
