Gender Equity Commission
Created after a City ordinance was passed in December 2016, and recently amended in 2024, the Gender Equity Commission (GEC) is responsible for advising the Mayor and City Council on ways to identify and address gender inequities that impact residents in the City of Pittsburgh. The Gender Equity Commission specifically focuses on rectifying discrimination effecting marginalized groups such as women of color, transgender and gender non-conforming people.
