Sweet Summer Scenes: Relishing Outdoor Meals On Local Farms & Rooftop Patios
With patios and rooftops a-buzz, there’s never been a better time to partake in alfresco meals and drinks around the city. Tried-and-true patios draw folks to spaces like coveted Pusadee’s Garden in Lawrenceville and The Porch in Oakland, just beneath the Cathedral of Learning, while community-minded spots like City Kitchen have recently drawn in new crowds with events and screenings (ranging from ‘Love Island’ to Wimbledon finals), accompanied by themed drinks to fit each happening vibe.
And nearby in East Liberty, brand-new sensation Palm Palm has brought an outdoor (dog-friendly!) dining space to the trendy venue that melds West Coast vintage vibes with sensational fare. At Palm Palm, don’t miss their brûléed oranges, tuna sushi tots or whole branzino, complemented by a uniquely greens-enhanced Palm Palm Margarita. On the Southside,The Distillery Complex offers the latest addition to Pittsburgh’s rooftop lineup, thanks to The Finch opening on the sixth floor of this historic building, a former whiskey distillery.
Here are some other ways to dine under the stars this summer.

FARM MAGIC IN THE SOUTH HILLS
We were thrilled to recently join one of the Churchview Farm Dinner Series on a magical evening when big rains held off, and the sky split into brilliant shards of peachy pink just as we sat to dinner. Tickets to these events typically sell out like hotcakes the morning they’re announced, so we felt especially fortunate to partake in an evening showcasing the food of Jillian's Restaurant, a true “chef's restaurant" in New Kensington, where working with local farmers, meat and cheese producers sits at the heart of the business. For Churchview, 2025 marks the thirteenth season of hosting onsite events, and the fifteenth year of farming and educating the community.
The evening began with a cocktail and chit-chat enjoyed around a wise, old tree (whose canopy protected guests from a temporary sprinkle). The group then moved up toward the covered dining area, settling into assigned seats for a multi-course meal not soon to be forgotten. During the feast, “owner, visionary and farmer” Tara Rockacy announced that, after a five-year journey, she had just been approved to build out a new teaching kitchen and 48-seat dining space she believes will take the venue to “the next level.” They're currently working on an October start date for construction, and it will be completed for the 2026 season.
In 2010, Rockacy stepped away from her career within public libraries to reestablish her family’s sustainable, third-generation farmette, which now harvests hundreds of varieties of heirloom fruit and produce. The vibrant community space is also home to a variety of “feathered, furred and winged friends” (many of them rescues), from pasture-raised laying hens and ducks for egg production to three “pet” goats. An apiary offers seasonal raw honey and vital crop pollination, too. Though you’re only a short drive from the city here on this tranquil South Hills property, you immediately feel worlds away from day-to-day obligations and woes.
Seasonal events like these dinners support the educational endeavors and community engagement that sit at the core of the farm’s mission. “We don't sell any produce here, everything is grown by and distributed to those who participate in our zero-cost weekly programming and the rest is allocated to the event chefs who cook these dinners,” Rockacy explains. (September events were just announced.)
Highlights of our Jillian’s Restaurant feast ranged from the double-fried Farm 57 chicken with deviled Churchview eggs, caviar and house-made ramp ranch with farm herbs, to Serenity Hill baby back ribs (featuring Churchview Farm gooseberry BBQ) and Laurel Hill trout Nicoise. Perhaps the highlight, though, was the 21-day, dry-aged burger on a house-made bun with Churchview slaw featuring fennel, chard and kale all grown on the farm. Spot-on pairings by sommelier Alyssa McGrath of Skurnik Wines ranged from a Chilean cabernet sauvignon to a Hojun Yuzu sake that matched delightfully with the gooseberry strawberry crumble finale. Chef’s kiss.

A CAPTIVATING HIDEAWAY
On a separate evening in June, we were whisked away to yet another enchanted world at beautiful Hyeholde in Coraopolis. Since 1937, this storied property has served farm-to-table dishes surrounded by four acres of lush gardens. During the summer, you can relish their outdoor dining scene every Tuesday through Saturday evening (weather dependent).
Hyeholde sits on four acres of pastoral grounds, allowing the restaurant to sustainably source produce from its own land. The team grows their own herbs, small orchards provide fresh fruit, and apiaries produce 150 pounds of honey each year, which is harvested on a bi-annual basis.
After the second annual Black Tie Farmers Market, showcasing local vendors ranging from Goat Rodeo Farm & Dairy and Olive & Marlowe to Barsotti Wines, we sat down to a delightful dinner spread, complete with perfectly-paired wine accompaniments. Highlights ranged from the first course — smoked trout with potato latke, trout roe, creme fraiche and chervil paired with Domaine Michel Girard de Fils Sancerre 2023 to the third — rabbit porchetta with a delightful side of radish and carrot salad and smoked mustard, paired with Fabulas “Fortitudo” Cerasuolo d’Abruzzo 2023. The grilled local asparagus and mushrooms were also outstanding, as was the finale of strawberry rhubarb pie with pistachio ice cream.
Chef O’Brien says they take great pride in offering “exceptional, high-quality dishes,” and collaborate with a carefully chosen network of specialized vendors who share their dedication to quality and sustainability. This includes Three Rivers Grown, Eichner's Farm, Laurel Hill Trout, The Lettuce Ladies and others. “It's thanks to them that we’re able to provide guests with a truly unique dining experience reflective of our home in Coraopolis,” he says.
O'Brien first stepped into the role of executive chef at Hyeholde in 1997, then returned in 2021 and eventually became the owner in 2023 after purchasing it from Barbara McKenna. “This place holds deep personal significance for me — I even got married here,” he says, “and I’ve always been drawn to its distinct vision of refined, locally-driven cuisine.“
A few highlights on their summer menu to look forward to? “We add a grilled smoked pork ribs dish with a truffle potato salad that really screams summer picnic in an elevated way,” Chef O’Brien promises. “Also peaches, plums, local corn and watermelon are all coming into season.” He believes their new menu additions are rooted in the integrity of the farmers' bounty. For this team, inspiration comes through the process of keeping things local and fresh — and factoring in the unexpected, too. Sometimes, for example, they may receive a bushel of local-farmed vegetables before they even know what they're going to do with them.
This summer the Hyeholde picnics return for a second year, inviting visitors to experience the magic of a summer evening on the grounds with intimate, chef-curated baskets. Other happenings here have ranged from an evening of magic with an acclaimed local illusionist to festive beer dinners.
For an extra-special night out, consider booking a chef’s table experience (subject to availability, with only two reservations per evening.) And before you dive into your lovely Hyeholde escape, just be sure to peek at the venue’s age restrictions and attire guidelines.

ROOFTOP PICNICS DOWNTOWN
Lastly, we checked out the Rooftop Sip and Soiree Sunset Picnic series at downtown’s Hotel Monaco Pittsburgh, which offers a fun, elevated city perspective. (The next one takes place August 17, from 6 to 9 p.m.) While sitting on a loungey couch — or chilling nearby on floor cushions — each couple or pair of friends enjoys a bottle of wine, acoustic music by Melina Bowser and access to an extensive antipasto/charcuterie spread. It’s a lovely way to pause and close out the weekend in an unlikely downtown setting.
The hotel’s rooftop bar Biergarten will also host a “Beach Party” August 15 from 5 to 11 p.m., as well as a “Beach Week” Thursday, August 14, through Sunday, August 17 (think beachy cocktails, summer menu offerings from Executive Chef Dave Racicot, games, giveaways and live entertainment). Live music happens on Wednesdays from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m., and Sunday Spritz sessions take place weekly, from 1 to 5 p.m. with $10 Aperol Spritz specials, a special Campari cocktail menu and DJ-enhanced vibes all set against sweeping rooftop views. (No tickets needed.)
Here’s to soaking into these sweet summer scenes while the season’s still kicking.
