What musical opportunities does Pittsburgh really have to offer for students?

Here's My Story
When I moved from Eastern Pennsylvania to the great city of Pittsburgh in the summer of 2022, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. While I chose the University of Pittsburgh for its vibrant location, surrounded by a plethora of UPMC locations–as an aspiring healthcare provider–I was skeptical as to whether the music scene would live up to my expectations.
As a high school student, music consumed my entire life. Jazz Band, Symphony Orchestra, Marching Band, Pit Orchestra, and honors ensembles filled my calendar each week, convincing me there was no better place to be than with my French Horn at my average-sized public high school. However, I was wrong. Since attending Pitt, I’ve been enriched with a multitude of musical opportunities I couldn’t have dreamed of, including Pitt’s very own Varsity Marching Band.
Within this guide are my personal recommendations, both experienced and non, for music in Pittsburgh to give you the best possible experience while you’re here. Listed under each are instructions on how to get to and from, and the prices for each– a college student’s must-know.

Introduction
Pittsburgh is infamous for its live performance venues. From the notorious Stage AE, to smaller spaces like Mr. Smalls Theatre and the Thunderbird Cafe &amp; Music Hall, Pittsburgh is no stranger to live music. Here are a few of Pittsburgh’s best places to catch live music:
Stage AE
Stage AE is a multi-purpose entertainment venue on Pittsburgh’s North Shore, featuring both indoor and outdoor stages. It hosts a wide variety of concerts, from rock to hip-hop, and is a popular student-friendly spot due to its diverse lineup and close proximity to major attractions like Heinz Field and PNC Park.
In 2024, Stage AE hosted upcoming artists such as Chappell Roan and Noah Kahan, attracting large student-centric crowds. Located at 400 North Shore Drive, Stage AE is easily accessible by bus routes 1, 2, or 16.
The North Side Station on the T light rail is also nearby, providing easy access from various parts of the city. Ticket prices vary depending on the artist, typically ranging from $30 to $100. Some events may even have discounted student tickets.

Exposition
Pittsburgh’s jazz scene is nothing short of exceptional. Pittsburgh, due to its convenient location between New York and Chicago, brought along a wave of jazz during the 1920’s, deeming its very own Hill District as “Little Harlem.”
The iconic Crawford Grille in the Hill District, opened in 1950, quickly gained state and national attention as a place where black and white musicians could make music together, attracting jazz greats such as Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. Here are some places in Pittsburgh that offer live jazz music, accessible for students and families.
Con Alma
Con Alma blends live jazz with Latin American cuisine. It’s a popular spot for jazz lovers and foodies alike, offering an immersive cultural experience almost every night.
Located downtown at 613 Penn Avenue, Con Alma is reachable via several bus routes, including 61A, 61B, and 71B, or by the T light rail at the Wood Street Station. There’s usually a cover charge of $10-20 depending on the night.
JazzLive
JazzLive is a free, weekly jazz series organized by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, typically held at the Backstage Bar at Theater Square in Downtown Pittsburgh. It’s a great way for students (over 21) to enjoy live jazz in a casual setting without breaking the bank.
Located at 655 Penn Avenue, Theater Square is accessible by bus routes like 61A, 61B, and 71B, or by taking the T light rail to the Wood Street Station. Free admission. Upcoming artists to be featured include: Jamey Haddad, the Reggie Watkins Quartet, and the Mila Shadel Trio.

Jam on Walnut
Jam on Walnut is a summer street festival series in the Shadyside neighborhood, featuring live music and vendors. It’s a popular event for students due to its free entry and lively atmosphere, offering a great way to enjoy music in an outdoor setting. The event typically showcases a mix of local and regional acts that cover various genres, from rock to country.
The next Jam on Walnut will take place on Saturday, August 17. The event takes place on Walnut Street in Shadyside, accessible by bus routes 71A, 71C, and 64. Free entry, though donations are encouraged as the event supports local charities. Typically runs from 7-11 p.m. on select Saturdays during the summer months.
Recapitulation
As we near the end of our musical journey, we get to the stringent recapitulation that is – benefits and performances students have access to. As a student at the University of Pittsburgh, here’s a rundown of everything music related we as students (at Pitt) have access to.
Varsity Marching Band
Students can receive discounted season passes to home games at Acrisure Stadium to watch the Pitt Football Team with a side of marching band at halftime. The energy is electric on game day, and if we win, the “victory lights” beam from the top of the Cathedral of Learning – a truly special feeling. As a member of the band there’s nothing like playing with 200+ other members to a filled stadium.

Cheap Seats program
This program provides deeply discounted tickets to: The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Pittsburgh Public Theater, Quantum Theatre, Renaissance &amp; Baroque, City Theatre, Calliope Folk Music Society, and PICT Classic Theatre. The program is offered to students, staff and faculty with Pitt ID and students may purchase up to four tickets. As an avid classical music enjoyer, I’ve used this program to buy discounted tickets to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra–one of my favorite concerts being the PSO’s rendition of Gustav Holst’s The Planets.

Pitt Music Department
And, of course, the very program I’m pursuing a minor of music with, Pitt’s very own Music Department. The Pitt Music Department, while not a conservatory or school of music, is home to many ensembles featuring wildly talented students, staff, and faculty. Ensembles include African Music and Dance, Afropop, Bluegrass, Chamber Music, Heinz Chapel Choir, Jazz Ensemble, Men’s Glee Club, Symphony Orchestra, Symphonic Band, Treble Choral Ensemble, University Gamelan, and various Acapella groups.
As a member of the Symphony Orchestra and Symphonic Band on French Horn, I have received an enriched musical education. The performance and lecture series also includes the Music on the Edge (MOTE) series–six concerts each year featuring cutting edge contemporary music ensembles from around the world.

Artful Wednesdays
Artists and performers in Nordy’s Place in the William Pitt Union (lower level) Wednesdays during the spring semesters from Noon-1 p.m. Free performance / art AND lunch! What more could you want! The Spring 2023 selections for Artful Wednedays included artists such as the Beo String Quartet, Sweat Already Spring Band, and Liz Berlin.
Pittsburgh, with its live venues, jazz performances, festivals, and student-specific opportunities, is a city I am proud to call my home. A home I also hope to continue exploring as I complete my last two years at Pitt. I hope you were able to learn about a new venue or place to check out when you visit Pittsburgh!
