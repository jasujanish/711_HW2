About Public Works

The mission of the Department of Public Works is to operate and maintain infrastructure while providing essential services for everyday life, regional economic growth and environmental sustainability.
Public Works is dedicated to providing creative, customer-friendly service while preserving the City's infrastructure by maintaining City streets, preserving park facilities and rehabilitating public facilities. The department also meets the environmental needs of The City of Pittsburgh by collecting residential refuse and recyclables in addition to our Anti-Litter Division and monitoring of illegal dumpsites. Public Works is committed to providing prompt, efficient, and safe delivery of arboricultural services through our Forestry Division. Finally, Public Works ensures the safety of residents and City visitors by responding to emergencies such as flooding, land subsidence, snow / ice storms and other weather related catastrophes.
