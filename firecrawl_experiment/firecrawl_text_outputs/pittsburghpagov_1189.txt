Pittsburgh, PA – CitiParks is excited to host their annual Track and Treat Event at the Bud Harris Cycling Track located at 1401 Washington Blvd. in Highland Park on Saturday, October 18, 2025, from 12 pm – 4 pm.
“Track and Treat is one of the highlights of the year for CitiParks—bringing families together for a fun and active day outdoors,” said CitiParks Director, Kathryn Vargas. “Bud Harris Cycling Track provides the perfect setting for kids to enjoy riding their bikes, surrounded by festive Halloween fun and engaging activities.”
Residents are invited to join CitiParks for this fun and FREE healthy lifestyle event that will be one for the entire family to enjoy. With Track and Treat being Halloween-themed, families are welcome to wear their Halloween costumes. Attendees can also bring their own bikes or borrow one of ours as they cycle the track and learn bike etiquette &amp; safety and have a blast decorating their bikes. In addition, children can enjoy Halloween and seasonal activities, such games, crafts, face painting and more along the Track with music, refreshments and life-sized seasonal decor.
The event will also host a costume contest at 2 pm. So, be sure to come decked out in your spookiest attire!
The Bud Harris Cycling Track is a half-mile oval loop along Washington Boulevard. It is a one-of-a-kind attraction, drawing elite cyclists and beginners to its banked corners and slight hill. Formerly a drivers' training course, the facility accommodates track and criterium racing and time trials.
