Food Waste
Food Waste diversion is not mandatory at special events in The City of Pittsburgh; however, it is highly encouraged that event producers make it available for food vendors and attendee stations at festivals, fairs, and venues. For a list of vendors visit our Zero Waste Resources Page or Sustainable Event Guidelines(PDF, 659KB) .
Options
You can either:
Hire a private hauler to collect your recycling
Self-haul recyclables collected at your event to a City of Pittsburgh recycling drop-off or a recycling processor
Contact the City of Pittsburgh Recycling Division to determine logistics for the City to collect recycling at the end of your special event (based on availability)

Pre-Event Planning
Pack-In/Pack-Out: Talk with your vendors and/or fellow event coordinators to understand who, what, where and how many materials will be generated. Establish ownership of these materials and eliminate waste whenever possible.
Develop and coordinate a plan for handling and recycling the materials once collected:
Find out what programs or equipment are already available on-site at your venue. Existing infrastructure may be sufficient for your needs.
Arrange for the storage and/or return of loaned equipment (City-owned equipment must be returned the following business day).
Once you have developed your plan, be sure to actively communicate expectations/availability of recycling and disposal options with your visitors, staff and/or volunteers.
Best Management Practices
Always pair your trash and recycling containers together to make disposal options both obvious and convenient for your attendees and to prevent confusion and/or contamination.
Use different colored bags for your trash and recycling to make sure separated materials are kept separate throughout the handling process.
Break down and flatten any and all corrugated cardboard boxes and place them all on a pallet or designated collection area.
Recycling Contamination & Why It Matters?
One of the biggest challenges facing recycling right now is contamination by wishful recycling or “wish-cycling”. This happens when non-recyclable objects are placed in the recycling bin with the wish it will be recycled. Additionally, recycling contamination occurs when food residue, liquids, and unacceptable materials—such as bagged recyclables, plastic bags, plastic films, plastic packaging, electronics, hazardous waste, Styrofoam, batteries, sharps, food waste, greasy pizza boxes, and other durable goods like Tupperware, storage containers, or even plastic hangers—are placed in the recycling can. Contaminants not only degrade the materials, boosting costs, but they can potentially cause harm to the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) and city employees.
