Fee Schedule
Revised January 1, 2023. To learn more about the changes, see the Fee Restructuring FAQ(PDF, 133KB). To calculate your fees prior to filing your zoning application, see the 2023 ZDR Fee Calculator. Zoning Review fees totalling over $15,000.00 are split into two payments. 40% will be assessed at the time of application and the remaining 60% is due prior to permit issuance.
Starting on January 1, 2024, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) will begin assessing fees for certain reviews performed on a Zoning and Development Review application. These new fees are independent of the Zoning Division’s fee schedule but have been outlined below due to their creation on the zoning application. Please direct questions about DOMI fees to DOMI staff at 412-255-2370 or domipermits@pittsburghpa.gov.
