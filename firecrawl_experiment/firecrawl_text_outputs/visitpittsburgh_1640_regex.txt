Where do the Pirates play their home games?
PNC Park is the celebrated baseball stadium, situated in the North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that proudly serves as the home of the Pirates.
How to get to PNC Park
Public Transportation
Since parking on the North Shore near the stadium is limited, it's often easier to park and ride to the stadium using other options. Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) offers light rail service on the T and city buses for fans coming from Downtown Pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. You can find more information on how to get to the stadium on the PRT website.
Riverboat Shuttles
The Gateway Clipper also offers gameday riverboat rides to the stadium and is my personal favorite way to get to the game. Park at Station Square, grab your tickets and enjoy your ride around the Point with raucous, fun-loving fans before getting dropped off right at the stadium. Find more information about riverboat shuttles here.
Driving & Parking Information
If you are planning to drive and park near the stadium, visit ALCO parking for a helpful interactive guide to parking on the North Shore.

Where to eat near PNC Park
The North Shore, home to PNC Park, is filled with plenty of bars and restaurants for all baseball fans.
Shorty's Pins & Pints, Southern Tier, Tom's Watch Bar, Burgatory, Bar Louie, and Mike's Beer Bar are popular spots to grab a craft beer pre- or post-game that are walkable to PNC Park. Even if you don't have a ticket, these locales are some of the best places to watch the game outside of PNC Park, promising a lively atmosphere and passionate fans cheering on every play to go with your food and drink.
If you're looking to eat inside of the stadium, here are the food highlights you can expect to find (spoiler, they're all mouthwatering).
What else to do near PNC Park
There's so much to do in the North Shore we did a whole blog about everything to explore pre- or post-game, from stadium tours and museum visits to kayaking, duckpin bowling and shopping for the latest Pirates merch.
More cool things to do near PNC Park
Show your Pittsburgh pride by taking a selfie with the Roberto Clemente Statue, which sits outside of PNC Park.
Stand at the spot of the Immaculate Reception, the most well-known play in NFL history, where Steelers legend Franco Harris caught a ball just before it touched the grass and changed the fate of the franchise.
Ride to the game in style. Park in Station Square and ride the Gateway Clipper on our scenic three rivers, available pre- and post-game.
Watch more sports! The Penguins, Steelers, Riverhounds, Riveters, and Pitt Panthers will satisfy all of your sports needs.
If you have time before or after the game, take a ride on the Duquesne Incline nearby for amazing city and river views.
