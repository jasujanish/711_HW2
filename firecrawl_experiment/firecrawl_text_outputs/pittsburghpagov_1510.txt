Citiparks Partners
The Allegheny Regional Asset District - RAD - invests in Allegheny County's quality of life through financial support of libraries, parks and trails, arts and cultural organizations, regional attractions, sports and civic facilities, and public transit. Founded in part to remove sole financial burden from the City of Pittsburgh for regional attractions, in RAD's nearly 28 years of public support, the five regional parks have received over $150 million in operating and capital grants. RAD is proud to play such a significant role in ensuring that our regional parks are safe and vibrant places for our communities to gather, explore, and be inspired.
The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy was founded in December 1996 by a group of citizens. A non-profit organization, the Parks Conservancy works closely with the City of Pittsburgh under an official public interest partnership agreement to restore and improve the city's park system to its full potential. To date, the Parks Conservancy has raised more than $130 million and completed more than 22 major park improvement projects. The Parks Conservancy works with thousands of volunteers and provides programming for more than 7,500 children annually. Learn more about our partners at the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy.
