Waste Disposal Resources
For bulky or large waste items able to be set out for curbside pick-up, please see our Environmental Services page.
For disposal of items not accepted at curbside pick-up such as construction or demolition material, tires, appliances, covered devices, etc., thereâ€™s a number of options available for each. Keeping our City clean from dumping requires that everyone does their fair share in making sure their waste is responsibly and properly disposed of.
If you are paying a private business or person to transport your waste for you, always demand they give you a receipt from the disposal facility afterwards before paying in full!
Transfer Stations
Transfer Stations authorized by Allegheny County Municipal Solid Waste Management Plan provide access for large and bulky waste disposal. Residents and businesses alike can make use of most of these services. Please contact the business beforehand to learn of cost of services, accepted times of drop off, and other necessary information.
