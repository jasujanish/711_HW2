City of Pittsburgh: Emergency Storm Response Update
Date: May 1, 2024
From: Mayor Ed Gainey and City of Pittsburgh, Emergency Management
Overview of Impact: An unprecedented, severe storm caused widespread damage across Pittsburgh. Staff from the Mayor’s Office, Public Safety, Public Works, DOMI and I&amp;P are coordinating 24/7 with PennDOT, Pittsburgh Water and Duquesne Light Company (DLC) to ensure the fastest possible recovery and restoration of services.

We are monitoring the weather closely for a potential damaging storm this evening
In the immediate wake of the storm there were 325,000 outages across the DLC service area, with more than 140,000 in Pittsburgh. As of the morning of May 1, the number of remaining outages in the city stood at 84,000.
DLC continues to prioritize hospitals, Department of Public Safety facilities, Pittsburgh Water distribution infrastructure, PPS Schools, senior high rises, dialysis centers and other critical facilities for power restoration.
DPW is coordinating closely with DLC to remove trees as soon as they are cleared of power lines.
400 added electrical workers are on the ground helping with restoration of power
Of 60 traffic signals that were impacted by power outages, we have restored 30 to normal operation.
This morning, all PPS schools are open with the exception of several schools in the south hills that are in session remotely.

Power issues at Pittsburgh Water’s pumping facilities have been resolved, avoiding a potential drop in water pressure.
Mayor Gainey declared a disaster emergency yesterday, to give the city maximum flexibility in addressing damage through coordination with other agencies and to ensure that both the city and residents are poised to receive any financial support that may come from the Commonwealth or Federal Government.
