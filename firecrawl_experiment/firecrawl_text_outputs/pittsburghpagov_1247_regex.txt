Mellon Park Tennis Center
Tennis enthusiasts can take to the court year-round at the Mellon Park Tennis Center! The air-conditioned "bubble" is the perfect place to enjoy a little competition or learn the game.
Classes range from "Tiny Tots" (for kids 6 years old and under) to "Advanced Adult"—and every age and skill level. You can take advantage of permanent or occasional court time. And be sure to ask about special week-day senior rates!
This indoor tennis center features a state-of-the-art playing surface, showers and many other amenities. The center is conveniently located on 5th Avenue and Beechwood Avenue in the city's East End.
