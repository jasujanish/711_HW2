Neighborhood Employment Centers (NEC’s)
Pittsburgh is a city of neighborhoods, and residents are inclined to utilize services located within their own neighborhood. The NECs help to ensure that employment services are made available to those residents who might otherwise not receive it. The City of Pittsburgh has historically supported up to six (five currently) geographically dispersed community-based organizations which operate Neighborhood Employment Centers (NECs). The Centers provide essential employment services to City residents such as job placement assistance, job development, educational referrals, employment workshops, employment referrals and employment counseling. Presentations on relevant topics such as healthcare, workforce survival skills, job readiness and employment and education trends are also available. Local employers, including the City of Pittsburgh, conduct interviews regarding open roles and positions. Centers also provide a limited set of educational programs. Services are available in convenient neighborhood settings.
