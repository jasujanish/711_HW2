🐍 When is the Lunar New Year?
Jan. 29, 2025
🐍 What’s with the snake? I thought 2025 in Pittsburgh was the year of the pierogi?
Here’s the deal on the snake: In Chinese culture, the calendar year is not dictated by constellations or the stars. Instead, the calendar is considered a lunisolar one which is based on the sun and moon placements.
Every year gets assigned an animal – and 2025 is the snake. Birth years also get assigned an animal from the zodiac. If you were born in 1989, 2001 or 2013 – we have a feeling this year is going to be a lucky one for you.

🐍 How else can I honor Chinese culture in Pittsburgh?
Hungry? There’s no shortage of dumpling shops, noodle spots and more if you want to feed your soul this year. Plus, dumplings are said to symbolize wealth and prosperity, and noodles longevity. Just be sure not to bite or cut the noodles, slurp them up whole!
Looking for community? Considering volunteering with Pittsburgh Chinese Cultural Center or becoming a member of OCA Pittsburgh.
The year of the snake is sure to be bold. Enjoy a safe and happy lunar new year. 🐉
