The Equipment Leasing Authority (ELA) was incorporated in 1980 to serve as a financing mechanism enabling the City of
Pittsburgh to make major equipment purchases, primarily vehicles. The ELA would issue bonds, buy the vehicles, hold
title to those vehicles, and lease them to the City. The lease payments amortized the bonds. Since its
incorporation, the ELA has continued its role as the City's central player in Fleet acquisition, maintenance,
repair, and replacement.
