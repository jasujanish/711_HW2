What is Picklesburgh?
Picklesburgh is a dill-icious weekend in Downtown Pittsburgh dedicated to the humble pickle. Headlined by a giant flying Heinz pickle balloon, the Picklesburgh festival is a true culinary celebration.
Why pickles? Well, you may be surprised to know that Pittsburgh has a wonderful pickle history and enjoys celebrating the current pickle nostalgia!

While You're In Town...
Picklesburgh weekend is going to be jam-packed with events happening throughout the city! America's Mile will take over the North Shore for a spectacular race event open to all, set against Pittsburgh's breathtaking North Shore. Choose your challenge from diverse heats like the inclusive MOVE Mile, the Kids of STEEL Mile, and the competitive Unstoppable Mile (just to name a few of your options!), catering to every age and ability.
After America's Mile, take a breather while walking along the Great Lawn to see the official Countdown Clock to the 2026 NFL Draft (and if you take a picture, make sure to show us by tagging us on social media!). Then, it's just a hop, skip, and walk-across-a-bridge away to Downtown Pittsburgh for Picklesburgh!
If you're feeling a little overwhelmed by the crowds in the heart of the downtown, head over to Schenley Park for the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix, the only motor race to take over city streets.
