Senior Lunch Program
Residents age 60+ (spouses under 60 are also eligible) can enjoy a nutritious lunch at CitiParks Healthy Active Living Centers. The program runs Monday through Friday. Meals are provided through a partnership with the Allegheny County Department of Human Services and the Area Agency on Aging. Suggested donation for lunch is $0.50.
To have lunch at a Healthy Active Living Center, please pre-register by noon 2 days before joining us at the Center for Lunch. We have a new Senior Foods Service Provider, and we are super-excited for you to try the new menu! We look forward to seeing you at lunch!
