Urban Agriculture

Urban agriculture is a way of using city land to grow food, which is a great way to help decrease food insecurity and to stabilize local food systems. It is also ecologically friendly and helps increase biodiversity.
Pittsburgh has a wealth of community gardens, school gardens, and farms, and many resources for anyone who wants to start growing! If you're interested in learning how to grow food, get access to land for gardening, or getting permits to raise bees, chicken, ducks, or mini goats, here are some resources to help you get started.
