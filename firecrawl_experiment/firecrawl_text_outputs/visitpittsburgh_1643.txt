21 Foods You Can Only Get in Pittsburgh
When you're in Pittsburgh, make sure you eat like the locals do.
Pittsburgh is known for many claims to fame, ranging from our sports teams to our yellow bridges and iconic rivers, and increasingly for our food scene. Here, diverse immigrant food heritages come together and create one-of-a-kind gems in this part of Western Pennsylvania. While you're in the Burgh, be sure to check out regional specialties you'll only be able to find in the Steel City, from Eastern European cuisine to Italian-American bites.
1. Primanti Sandwich
No Pittsburgh food list would be complete without mentioning Primanti Bros. Primanti's is responsible for arguably Pittsburgh's most famous sandwich – their signature offering consisting of grilled meat, melted cheese, oil-and-vinegar based coleslaw, tomato and French fries between Italian bread. I'd recommend trying one from the original Primanti Bros. location in the Strip District or at PNC Park when you're watching the Buccos play! My Go-To Order: Capicola, add an egg and lightly hot sauce before enjoying. Get the pickle on the side. Pair with an ice cold IC Light.

2. Pierogies
Pierogies hold a near and dear place to many Pittsburghers' hearts. From Pierogies Plus to Cop out Pierogies, the Pittsburgh Pierogi Truck and more, there is no shortage of great places for these delicious handmade dumplings. Pierogis can be found all over Pittsburgh: there's an entire festival devoted to them at Kennywood, mascots donning pierogi costumes race around PNC Park during all home games, and pierogi t-shirts, earrings and Christmas ornaments are plentiful as you shop around the city.
Let's talk about the Pierogi Pizza. Combining two long-standing favorite dishes, this delicious 'za is one you have to taste to believe. One of my favorites is at Aiello's Pizza in Squirrel Hill.

3. Pittsburgh Salad
The French Fries in Pittsburgh don't just stop at sandwiches. One of my personal favorite meals is the Pittsburgh Salad, featuring French Fries as a topping on a salad as if they were croutons. It's the best if you're in the mood for something light, but still looking to be filled up. North Park Lounge Grilled Chicken Salad is one of my favorites. The original North Park Lounge location is near McCandless Crossing but there are several other locations in and around the city so you can't go wrong.

4. Potato Patch Fries
Then there's The Potato Patch - famous for their French fries alone, without any accompanying sandwich or salad. Kennywood Park's fresh cut Idaho spuds are some of the most iconic food offering at a theme park you'll find. Complete with topping choices such as cheddar cheese, bacon, vinegar, brown gravy and seasoning salts, summer just doesn't feel complete without a stop by The Potato Patch.

5. Gobblerito
Here's an Only in Pittsburgh menu item to be thankful for in November – the gobblerito. Mad Mex is responsible for this unique meal that manages to fit an entire Thanksgiving dinner in one burrito – from the turkey, potatoes, stuffing, complete with a topping of gravy and served with a side of cranberry sauce. Make sure you don't miss it as it's only available seasonally!

6. Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte

7. Turner's Tea
When I'm visiting friends out of state, you can bet I'm filling a cooler with Turner's for them. Operating for over 50 years, one sip of a Turner's product is enough to turn anyone into a lifelong fan. Their iced tea, sold in signature orange and yellow cartons, is now a lifestyle as much as a drink with shirts and Turner's merch sold throughout the city.
Their local farm to bottle milk can't be beat, either. Be sure to follow their Instagram, as collaboration and/or limited time drinks are dropping frequently, and will sell out instantly.

8. Sarris Candies
When you're thinking of a go-to gift for someone you love, it's always Sarris Candies. This local chocolate maker has grown into an empire over their 50+ years in business, and their confections can now be found in 11 states and shipped worldwide. My Go-To: Their chocolate covered pretzel rods are my favorite, but I'm also a huge fan of the Pittsburgh Pothole Filler (dark chocolate-dunked popcorn).

9. Smiley Cookies
I have more nostalgia for Smiley Cookies than anything on this list. They remind me of family dinners and treats for doing well in school. This simple frosted cookie at Eat'n Park has been a hit with children since 1986, and are given away after each kid's meal ever since.
My Go-To: While Eat'n Park changes up the Smiley Cookies seasonally, make sure to grab the pumpkin decorated ones for fall; those candy corn just hit different.

10. Oakmonter
Pittsburgh knows its desserts. Right up with there with Prantl's is Oakmont Bakery's aptly named Oakmonter, a vanilla cheesecake and chocolate cake filled with fudge and topped with cherries, buttercream and chocolate bars. When you bring this to the party or get together, you instantly become everyone's friend.

11. Gobs
I love food with a story. Gobs were created out of necessity and practicality, as miners in the region needed a dessert that wouldn't fall apart and was easy to eat. Enter the handheld gob, two small chocolate cakes with icing pressed between them, that became a fixture of lunch pails from then on. Gobs can be found in bakeries across the region with variants such as red velvet and (my favorite) pumpkin. My Go-To: Pumpkin Gobs (seasonal) from local supermarket chain Giant Eagle.

12. Pamela's Hotcakes
Make your way to Pamela's Diner and order the paper-thin, crepe-like hotcakes for a delicious breakfast you won't soon forget. Order the hotcakes filled with fruit and brown sugar, topped with whipped cream, or drizzled with syrup.
13. Heinz Ketchup
This iconic, world-renowned condiment was created in Pittsburgh in 1857. Heinz ramped up production of the tomato ketchup during the 20th century. As of today, the ketchup is no longer produced in the city, but it is still a popular condiment at local restaurants and residents' homes.
Make a Visit: The Heinz History Center is an expansive and interactive museum where you'll learn the history behind Pittsburgh and the most famous ketchup in the world. From a giant ketchup statue that's made out of Heinz bottles to a Mr. Rogers exhibit, don't miss the chance to venture through the biggest history museum in Pennsylvania. And, of course, enjoy the condiment on a little food break at the onsite cafe.
14. Pepperoni Roll
A simple, but incredibly tasty and satisfying baked good, pepperoni rolls came to Pittsburgh in the early 1900s as a means to feed hungry coal miners. Pepperoni rolls have become such a staple in the city you can find them at many of the bakeries in the city including Mancini's Bakery in the Strip District and Colangelo’s Bakery &amp; Café. Visit Rolling Pepperoni for classic pepperoni rolls as well as vegetarian and vegan options.

15. Beto's Raw Pizza
Have you ever had a pizza covered in cold toppings? The only cooked parts of Beto's raw pizza are the crust and sauce meaning each pizza is served with mounds of uncooked cheese and a variety of cold, classic pizza toppings. Take a bite as soon as it's served to enjoy the contrast between the hot crust and cold toppings or wait a few minutes and let the cheese melt a little, either way this is a style of pizza all pizza lovers should try.

16. Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey
Kentucky may be famous for its bourbon, but whiskey's popularity in the USA can be traced back to western Pennsylvania with the Monongahela Rye–a mash made with rye malted barley and no corn. Want to bring home a bottle? Stop by Wigle Whiskey in the Strip District to take a distillery tour and tasting.

17. Isaly's Chipped Chopped Ham
Thinly shaved and packed with flavor, chipped chopped ham has been a Pittsburgh staple for generations. This deli meat is made by blending ham trimmings, seasonings, and other ingredients into a loaf before slicing it razor-thin. While delicious on its own, the classic way to enjoy it is slathered in tangy barbecue sauce and served on a soft bun. You can often find Islay's Chipped Chopped Ham at deli counters throughout the city, making it easy to try during your visit.

18. Banana Split
This legendary dessert got its start just outside Pittsburgh in Latrobe, PA, at Tassel Pharmacy in 1904. The now-classic combination of three scoops of ice cream nestled between a split banana, drizzled with sauces, sprinkled with crushed nuts, and crowned with whipped cream and a cherry has been delighting sweet tooths for over a century. Visit one of our ice cream shops to enjoy this classic dessert.

19. Pickleball
As a city, we're obsessed with pickles and we're not sorry about it. Keep the Picklesburgh vibes going whenever you're in the Steel City by sipping on a Pickleball! Visit downtown Pittsburgh's Bridges and Bourbon for the sleek ambience and this tangy drink. Toki whiskey is elevated with pickle juice, club soda, lemons, and a hint of celery bitters in this ingenious cocktail creation.

20. Halusky
Pierogies aren't the only Eastern European specialty in Pittsburgh! Imagine soft, buttery noodles that melt in your mouth. Accompanied by sweet cabbage and onions, halusky is a no-frills comfort food that can be found at places like S&amp;D Polish Deli in the Strip District and Polska Laska in Sharpsburg.

21. City Chicken
Pittsburgh natives who have grown up with City Chicken know that it's not only made out of chicken! This Polish-American dish was created during the Great Depression and traditionally consists of cubed pork and veal on a stick. Pick up a City Chicken kit at a nearby Giant Eagle or a local butcher shop.
Harder to Find Old-School Pittsburgh Eats
Some Pittsburgh classics have faded from the spotlight, but they’re not entirely lost to history. Keep an eye out for a rare appearance of the Fussfungle cocktail and the Turkey Devonshire sandwich on restaurants menus. Keep an eye out for:

The Fussfungle Cocktail - Whiskey with a rich brown sugar-molasses syrup for a dark, complex flavor reminiscent of an Old Fashioned.
The Turkey Devonshire - An open-faced sandwich layered with roasted turkey, bacon, tomato, and a creamy cheese sauce.
Peanut butter &amp; taffy treat - While the original Clark Bar was discontinued, its since been brought back, so you can enjoy the perfectly crispy peanut butter and taffy treat coated in milk chocolate.
