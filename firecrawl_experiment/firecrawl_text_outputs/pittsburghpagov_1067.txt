McKinley Park History(show below)

Founded in 1898 as Maple Park.
Mckinley Park was purchased from Thomas Maple on May 10, 1898, at a cost of $63,000 and consisted of 63 acres of wooded hillsides and ravines.
The residents of Knoxville and Beltzhoover knew the park by such names as Butcher's Grove, Maple Park and Ritter's Hollow. It was renamed McKinley Park in 1902 after the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901.
