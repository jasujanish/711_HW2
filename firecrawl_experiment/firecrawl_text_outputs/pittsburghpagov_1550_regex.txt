Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT)
CERT is a training program that allows civilians and government employees to take the necessary steps in an emergency to save lives. During emergencies citizens can manage utilities and put out small fires; treat the medical emergencies by opening airways, controlling bleeding, and treating for shock; provide basic medical aid; search for and rescue victims safely; and organize themselves and spontaneous volunteers to be effective. CERTs are not intended to replace a community's response capability, but rather, to serve as an important supplement to it during emergencies when government response capabilities are spread thin.
