Pittsburgh's Life as a Showgirl: Celebrating Taylor Swift's 12th Album with 12 Pittsburgh Must-Sees
Calling all Swifties!
We've got your ultimate Pittsburgh itinerary to represent each of Taylor Swift's albums, in honor of her most recent release, "The Life of a Showgirl."
Debut
Pittsburgh's food
The amount of times I've been asked if Pittsburghers really do put French fries on their sandwiches shows me one thing: if you know nothing else about Pittsburgh, you know our food habits and preferences.
Some of the classic Pittsburgh spots for iconic food include Primanti Brother's, Beto's, and anywhere with pierogies, but there's so much more to the Steel City's culinary landscape than meets the eye.
Here are some of my favorite underrated Pittsburgh gems, much like Debut is an underrated album:

Pamela's has some of the best breakfast in the city and carries a cute diner vibe with each location (keep in mind, this is cash only). This is a pretty popular location among locals and is always the first place I recommend someone to go eat at. Get there early, especially on Sundays, because the line fills up quick!
Commonplace Coffee, specifically the Northside location, is my favorite coffee shop in all of Pittsburgh. It's on a corner of the Mexican War Streets and is within easy walking distance to The Mattress Factory, Randyland, and Allegheny Commons Park.
Speaking of coffee, I think that La Prima has some of the best blends in the city. I highly encourage you to get some at the shop's Strip District location, then take it with you as you browse all the shops and scenes the neighborhood has to offer.
For lunch, head just to the other side of the Allegheny River to Scratch &amp; Co. The homey spot in Pittsburgh's Troy Hill neighborhood offers cuisine made from local sources, innovative cocktails, and warm company.
For dinner, there are so many options to fit your vibe. For something beachy, try Palm Palm, a new restaurant in East Liberty. If you're looking for something sporty, head to Mike's Beer Bar in the North Shore right next to PNC Park. If you're feeling Italian, head to the Strip for DiAnoia's Eatery. Wherever you go, you can't go wrong.
To cap off your day with dessert, head to one of many Millie's locations throughout the city for delicious ice cream and milkshakes. If you're looking for more baked goods, try Oakmont Bakery or La Gourmandine for delicious pastries and sweets.

Fearless
North Shore/Northside
I would venture to say that Fearless was Taylor Swift's last true country album, so why not head to the North Shore and visit Pittsburgh's staple country bars: Tequila Cowboy and Jason Aldean's?
The North Shore features plenty of other places you can dance fearless or just kick back and enjoy a beverage, including McFadden's, Bar Louie, Shorty's, Southern Tier Brewing, and Voodoo Brewery.
Speak Now
Pittsburgh in the Winter
You'll want to come back in December for this. While it isn't a specific Pittsburgh place or location to visit, there's a magic that overtakes the city during the winter months.
Some highlights include:

Light Up Night the weekend before Thanksgiving
PPG Plaza's Outdoor Ice Rink
Peoples Gas Holiday Market
First Night celebration
Beautiful views of snow-covered hills and frozen rivers
Outdoor rec, including snowboarding, skiing, and ice skating

Here's everything you can expect from Pittsburgh in the winter.
Red
Heinz History Center
If there's any Pittsburgh attraction that boasts the most red, it's the Heinz History Center. From the iconic lights decorating the skyline to the Heinz ketchup bottle that used to overlook the now Acrisure Stadium (formerly Heinz Field), the likeness can be seen from the outside.
The inside is a whole other story. With a whole section dedicated to Heinz, including a giant ketchup bottle made of ketchup bottles, you won't find anywhere in the city quite as red. But it doesn't stop there. Pittsburgh-area native Fred Rogers is celebrated throughout the museum, who made his iconic red sweater synonymous with kindness in his television show Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.

1989
Mount Washington
1989 is an album that starts with an ode to Taylor Swift's beloved New York City (side note: did you know that she's originally from Pennsylvania?). As such, it seemed only right that it be represented by the place you can get the best view of Pittsburgh's skyline: Mount Washington. Ride the Duquesne Incline or Monongahela Incline up the side of the mountain and park yourself on one of the overlooks to take in the iconic city landscape.
But Mount Washington is more than just the view it provides. Beyond Grandview Avenue, the hilltop neighborhood of Mount Washington has so much more to see and do. There are plenty of spots to get food, drinks, and sweets as you browse the shops on Shiloh Street. I recommend stopping at Coughlin's Law for a bite on the patio but leaving yourself room to stop at Grandview Bakery on your way off the mountain.
Reputation
Pittsburgh's Sports
Pittsburgh's sports teams sure have big reputations; after all, the Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most championships in the National Football League. Luckily for those Swifties that are also sports fans, Pittsburgh has plenty of teams to pick from, and all their venues are relatively close to one another.
The Steelers play at Acrisure Stadium on the North Shore, providing one of the best views of one of the league's most iconic teams and the city skyline. While you're at the stadium, head over to the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, and step outside the stadium to our official 2026 NFL Draft Countdown Clock on the Great Lawn!
The Pittsburgh Pirates play just down the street at PNC Park, recently named USA Today's fourth best ballpark in the nation. Not only does PNC Park have arguably one of the best views of Pittsburgh's skyline, it also boasts plenty of theme nights throughout the season for the whole family (and sometimes dogs!) to enjoy. There are also plenty of unique food options at the ballpark that you have to try while you're in town; I recommend the fried almond torte and the Polish cannonball.
The Pittsburgh Penguins play at PPG Paints Arena in the city's Uptown. Grab your cardigans and see some of the National Hockey League's most iconic players throughout the winter months and into the spring.
The Pittsburgh Riverhounds and Pittsburgh Riveters play at Highmark Stadium, right along the Monogahela River. These two teams have shorter seasons compared to the other franchises in town, but that just means all the fun is packed into every game.

Lover
Kennywood
Nothing in the city screams Lover quite like the Goodnight heart that bids you farewell while leaving Kennywood. But the love doesn't start on your way out! It starts when you walk through the tunnel and are greeted with shops, games, and rides that are perfect for a day full of love, whether it be on a date or with friends or family.
An honorable mention for this album is, of course, love, Pittsburgh, which I highly recommend visiting as your one-stop shop for cute souvenirs before leaving the city!

folklore
Pittsburgh's Parks
All folklore fans are the outdoorsy types, and boy do we have plenty to go around! Pittsburgh is full of nature all throughout its neighborhoods and beyond, with lots of opportunities for outdoor rec like biking, hiking, kayaking, disc golf courses, and more!
Schenley Park sits next to Oakland and plays host to Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, and Frick Park is fairly close by and has Blue Slide Park - for any Swifties who are also fans of Mac Miller.
North of the city is North Park, where you can kayak, golf, fish, and play tennis. There's also South Park, where you can ice skate, enjoy the wave pool, and see American Bison in the wild!

evermore
Carnegie Museums
Pittsburgh has plenty of museums to enjoy, but something about the Carnegie Museums in Oakland just fit right into the evermore aesthetic for me.
The Carnegie Museum of Art boasts gorgeous pieces and some of the most beautiful architecture I've seen in the city. Renowned for its collections of more than 100,00 objects, it features a range of visual art, including painting, sculpture, decorative arts, design, and photography. There's also a bar downstairs where you can enjoy a glass of wine before perusing the collection.
The Carnegie Museum of Natural History is home to one of the country’s largest and most celebrated natural history collections featuring 22 million objects and specimens, ranging from real dinosaur fossils and dazzling gems and minerals to iconic wildlife dioramas.

Midnights
Kamin Science Center
Midnights is all about feelings during sleepless nights, and one of my favorite things to do during sleepless nights is seek out the stars. What better way to do that in Pittsburgh than the Kamin Science Center? You can soar to distant galaxies in Buhl Planetarium and Observatory and explore outer space in the new exhibition Mars: The Next Giant Leap.
While at the Science Center, you can also check out the world-renowned Miniature Railroad &amp; Village and the USS Requin (SS 481), a real submarine moored in the Ohio River.

The Tortured Poets Department
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
Arguably her most lyrical album, The Tortured Poets Department reads like any great tragic love story. At the Carnegie libraries scattered around the city, you can find something to replicate that feeling in book form, or something to act as a pick-me-up after this album rips your heart out.
With nearly two dozen locations to choose from, the local library is always just around the corner.
The Life of a Showgirl
Pittsburgh's Cultural District
And we come to the newest release, The Life of a Showgirl, which encapsulates Taylor Swift's career in the spotlight. Pittsburgh has its own section of the city that showcases those in the spotlight, and most of those places can be found in the Cultural District.
Pittsburgh's Heinz Hall, Byham Theater, Benedum Center, and O'Reilly Theater are all blocks away from one another and feature traveling shows from Broadway, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and select major artists throughout the year. There are also smaller venues, like Harris Theater and Liberty Magic, that put on their own shows full of wonder.
Performances aren't the only type of art that find their homes in the Cultural District. There are art galleries scattered throughout the streets, like Wood Street Galleries, SPACE, and 820 liberty gallery, where you can enjoy rotating exhibits of all varieties.
