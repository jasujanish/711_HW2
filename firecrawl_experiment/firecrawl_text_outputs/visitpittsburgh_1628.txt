Cool Activities for Kids
Walk to the Glass to Watch Warmups
Before the puck drops, it’s very common for people to mingle down by the ice, stand by the glass and try to get a puck or an item signed. There are always plenty of other families, and your chances of getting something from one of the Pens many stars aren’t too bad.
Go see Iceburgh
The Pens mascot, Iceburgh, always walks around during games and is a kid favorite. Get a picture with him! You’re bound to run into him as he dances over or slides into your section throughout the game.
Watch out for the Dance Cams
Has your kid ever wanted to get on the Jumbotron? This game could be their lucky day, there are always plenty of opportunities for your kids to show their moves at Pens games.

Can't get enough penguins in your life? Me neither. You can find the Pens' namesake animal at both the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; Aquarium and National Aviary. In the colder months starting in December, you can see the Penguins on Parade walking from the Aquarium and exploring the Zoo. Or, meet a penguin up close at the Aviary with a Penguin Encounter giving you a one-of-a-kind photo op or step into their enclosure when you book an interactive penguin feeding!
