Councilmember Barb Warwick
Barb Warwick was sworn in as the District 5 City Councilmember on December 12th, 2022. She was re-elected and sworn in for a full four-year term on January 8, 2024.
A working mom with four young kids, Barb has been living in the Four Mile Run section of Greenfield (The Run) since 2014. She got involved with City politics through her neighborhoodâ€™s winning fight to stop the build-out of the Mon-Oakland Connector shuttle road through Schenley Park and instead use those funds to fulfill long-time community needs, such as playground rehabilitation, rec center improvements, and more. She served as an elected member of the Greenfield Community Association (GCA) Board from 2020-2022 and sat on the Board of Pittsburghers for Public Transit from 2021-2023. She is also a long-time member of Hazelwood Initiative. A former teacher, she has been a regular volunteer after-school teacher and tutor for The Pittsburgh Project and the Hazelwood Cobras Afterschool program.
As City Councilmember, Barb prioritizes engaging with residents and community organizations from across District 5 and the rest of Pittsburgh to ensure that their needs, concerns, and priorities are at the heart of government decision-making.
