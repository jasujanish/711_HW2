Commercial Recycling Resources and Tonnage Reporting Requirement
As spelled out by Pittsburgh City Waste &amp; Recycling Code: §619.02(a) and §619.04(f), Allegheny County Solid Waste Code §570-17(a), and State Act 101, Section 904:

Recycling is mandatory in Pittsburgh
All businesses in Pittsburgh must establish a program to recycle at least three of the following types of materials:
Mixed Paper – White office paper, newspaper, magazines, hardcover/softcover books, catalogs, junk mail, phone books, paperboard, and flattened corrugated cardboard
Aluminum and steel – cans and bottles
Plastics – bottles, jugs, jars, and tubs
Glass – amber, green, and clear bottles, jugs and jars
Organic waste – leaves, garden residues, shrubbery, and tree trimming
The City is not able to service businesses and they are responsible for hiring a private collector for municipal waste and recyclables
List of Commercial Recycling Haulers(PDF, 64KB)
Anyone collecting and transporting recyclable materials must track source, tonnages, and disposal, and make regular reports to local government
All recycling tonnages must be reported to the City’s Recycling Division on a quarterly or yearly basis (business’ preference)
Private haulers can provide the tonnage report to the City on behalf of their clients
The City of Pittsburgh applies for State funding with these cumulative report totals and is eligible for up to $10 for every ton recycled within city limits
