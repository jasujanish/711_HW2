Popular Annual Financial Reports
The PAFR, as it's abbreviated, is a brief summary of the City's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (Annual Report). The PAFR is intended to increase knowledge of Pittsburgh's financial condition throughout the community.
Unlike the Annual Report, the PAFR is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals. The financial information within this report is taken, in large part, from the City's independently audited set of financial statements.
In addition to providing financial information, the PAFR provides information about Pittsburgh's demographics, elected officials and government and the Pittsburgh Promise.
