Envelope of Life
The Envelope of Life is a standardized form that provides life saving information to emergency personnel in times of crisis or medical uncertainty.
The form takes a few minutes to fill out and should be updated every 6 months.
The Envelope of LIFE(PDF, 208KB) is available as a download from this website or by email or it can be requested from EMS Headquarters at 412-622-6930.
Who Should Have the Envelope of Life?
The Envelope of Life is beneficial for everyone – from babies to seniors.
Where Should I Put My Envelope of Life?
The Envelope only works if paramedics can find it!
Here are few tips for making your envelope easy to find:

Display the envelope with the City of Pittsburgh seal facing OUT so that it is visible.
Attach the envelope to a prominent place in your house – a refrigerator, a door or somewhere else a paramedic can easily find it.
Keep a copy at home and one in your wallet or purse. Emergencies don't just happen at home!
