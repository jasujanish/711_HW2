🐍 When is the Lunar New Year?
Jan. 29, 2025
🐍 What’s with the snake? I thought 2025 in Pittsburgh was the year of the pierogi?
Here’s the deal on the snake: In Chinese culture, the calendar year is not dictated by constellations or the stars. Instead, the calendar is considered a lunisolar one which is based on the sun and moon placements.
Every year gets assigned an animal – and 2025 is the snake. Birth years also get assigned an animal from the zodiac. If you were born in 1989, 2001 or 2013 – we have a feeling this year is going to be a lucky one for you.
