If you're like me, Pittsburgh is your one true love. With so many fun and romantic things to do in the city, Valentine's Day is a great excuse to get out and try something new! Whether you're looking to shake things up or keep it simple, celebrating with friends or a significant other, there are plenty of ways to make it a lovely day.

Sit Back and Relax
Enjoy a special experience while someone else does the work with one of these mesmerizing activities.

Health, wellness and peace of mind are essential at Evolve Wellness Spa in Shadyside. Treat yourself and your partner to a luxurious and rejuvenating couple's massage, yoga, aromatherapy or a skin treatment for a day of pure relaxation.

The night also includes a Valentine's Day themed exhibit, strolling violinist, charcuterie, champagne and desserts.
If beer and a movie is more your speed, check out the adjoined Row House Cinema and Bierport in Lawrenceville. Pick up some craft brews (they'll even chill the beers for you!) and take them over to see a film from 2025's lineup of "Love Bites" like Deep Blue Sea and Secret Shark Movie Hint .
