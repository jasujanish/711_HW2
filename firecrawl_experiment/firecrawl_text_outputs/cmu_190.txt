Support Carnegie Mellonâ€™s 32nd Annual Food Drive
October 1, 2025
Dear Members of the CMU Community:
For more than three decades, our CMU community has been showing care and concern for our neighbors in need of food in the greater Pittsburgh area. Today we are excited to kick off the 32nd Annual Food Drive, organized and sponsored by Staff Council.
Coming together to support Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank is not only a chance to provide meals and resources, but also to strengthen a bond between our campus and the community that sustains us. Each year, it is a delight to see our students, faculty and staff unite to make a meaningful difference in addressing food insecurity in our region. According to the Food Bank, CMU organizes the highest-grossing food drive of any organization in the city of Pittsburgh!
Our goals this year are to raise $100,000 and gather nonperishable food items (especially peanut butter) for the Food Bank. We also aim to collect 250 can openers for the CMU Food Pantry. The 2025 drive runs through Saturday, Nov. 8.
