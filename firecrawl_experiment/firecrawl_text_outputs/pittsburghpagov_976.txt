The West End Overlook provides spectacular views of Pittsburgh in all its splendor.
West End Overlook History(show below)
The West End Overlook sits just over 700 feet above the Ohio River and is a four-acre parcel on Elliot Hill in the West End. The overlook project was financed by the Allegheny Conference on Community Development and the City of Pittsburgh under Mayor Barr.
The original overlook area consisted of little more than a car park and road. In 2003 the area was fully renovated. The new park consisted of the modern shelter house, parking lots, ADA-access and expanded landscaping.
