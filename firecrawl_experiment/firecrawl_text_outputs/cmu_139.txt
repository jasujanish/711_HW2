Call for Honorary Degree Nominations
July 7, 2025
Dear Members of the CMU Community:
I am writing to invite and encourage you to nominate candidates to be considered for an honorary degree from Carnegie Mellon University.
The CMU honorary degree is one of the highest distinctions the university bestows on an individual. Recipients serve as an inspiration to the Carnegie Mellon community, especially to members of the graduating class. Recognizing them reinforces the significant scope of the university and enhances the commencement ceremony by highlighting the importance of the university in the world. Learn more about the honorary degree nomination process, committee members and past recipients .
We seek to honor a stellar cohort of individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to their professions, to our nation, or to the world, and whose life and work are broadly connected to the highest aims and aspirations of this university.

Achieved preeminent levels of distinction in their fields and demonstrated extraordinary achievements, with a preference for those with a clear affiliation or connection to CMU;
