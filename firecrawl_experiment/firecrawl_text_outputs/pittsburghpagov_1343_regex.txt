Report Suspicious Activity
Call 9-1-1 to report anything that you are actively witnessing or that may be an immediate threat.
However, if nobody is in danger and yet you feel that government and law enforcement entities should be made aware of suspicious activity, please feel free to fill out a Suspicious Activity Report(PDF, 29KB).
You may also submit a general written email with a description of the suspicious activity. Public Safety officials will require as much information and details about what you saw as possible. Please send your suspicious activity report to suspicious@pittsburghpa.gov . Alternatively, if you would like to discuss any previous activity that seems suspicious in nature, please call the Pittsburgh Police Intelligence Unit at 412-323-7844.
Remember – when witnessing something active, always call 9-1-1 immediately!
See Something, Say Something!
If you see something, say something! Learn more about the campaign on improving the process of alerting government and law enforcement to information that could play a crucial role in keeping Pittsburgh secure.
