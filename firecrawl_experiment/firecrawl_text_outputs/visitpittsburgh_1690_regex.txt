‘Particular Brand of Magic’: Pittsburgh Ranks in Lonely Planet’s Top 10 Global Best in Travel 2025 List
It’s a magical day in the neighborhood. Pittsburgh has been recognized as a top spot for travel in 2025 by renowned travel guide publisher ﻿Lonely Planet.
Pittsburgh was the only U.S. city to earn a top spot on Lonely Planet’s Global Best in Travel 2025 list, a prestigious annual selection that highlights the world's top destinations, travel experiences, and trends.
What a feeling Pittsburgh inspires. This city effortlessly combines its industrial past with its artisanal present – its affordability and charm draws all manner of artists and creators.
Lonely Planet
Pittsburgh continues to evolve while constantly reminding all who experience it of its rich history. From the iconic entrance into the city from the Fort Pitt Tunnel or that first peek at the top of the U.S. Steel Tower when I-279 curves, that “particular brand of magic” captivates all who see the Steel City for the first and hundredth time.
A Look Back at the ‘Burgh
In what started as a fort built during the French and Indian War, Pittsburgh earned much of its personality today by once being the center of the American steel industry - it’s where the name of the Steelers came from, after all. The grit that came with working in the steel mills can still be felt in the community, from Fairywood to the East Hills.

A Taste of Pittsburgh
If you want to feel integrated as a Pittsburgher, there’s something special about walking through the City’s Strip District on a Steelers Sunday. What better way to capture the yinzer spirit than with a Primanti’s sandwich at the original location in the Strip, stacked high with vinegar-based coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries? We recommend, ironically enough, the Pitts-Burger. Can’t stomach fries on a sandwich? Then try it on a salad in classic Pittsburgh style. It’s good for the soul.
Whatever your taste, Pittsburgh has something for everyone. Take one of the inclines up Mt. Washington and check out the city skyline from the overlooks before stopping for a bite to eat with a view.
Walk around Butler St to witness the alchemy at local coffee shops, boutiques, independent restaurants and breweries. Soon you’ll understand Pittsburgh's particular brand of magic, at once disarming and familiar.

Before You Go...
There are some things that are simple must-dos in the Steel City. We’re called the City of Champions, so check out the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates play during their seasons. Lonely Planet recommends visiting in June, when the winter is over but the humid summer is still on the horizon. It’s also just in time for the Three Rivers Art Festival.
Even if you check everything off your Pittsburgh list, there’s always something new to discover around every corner. So whether you’re coming for a Steelers game on the weekend or hunkering down between the three rivers for the winter, we’re excited to welcome you as an honorary Yinzer.

A friendly neighborhood Pittsburgh transplant.
Probably at book club, a local coffee shop or thrift store. Tell your pet I said hi.
