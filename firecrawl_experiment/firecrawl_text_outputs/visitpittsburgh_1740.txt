10 Things to Do on Pittsburgh's Three Rivers
Your guide to getting out on Pittsburgh's iconic Three Rivers
The three rivers that run through our city make for a beautiful photo backdrop no matter the season, but from early spring until the middle of fall, we invite you to get out onto the rivers yourself!
From riverboats and kayaks to tikis, pontoons and even a submarine, enjoy the views and explore our city‚Äôs waterways with these unique Pittsburgh aquatic adventures! Main Photo Credit: Richard Nowitz
A Quick River Primer
Before you head out on your river trek, be sure you know your rivers. The Allegheny (pronunciations phonetically below) divides Downtown and the Northside of the city, the Monongahela (you can always just call this The Mon and sound like a local) divides Downtown and the Southside, and the Ohio starts where the other two meet at the Point. Now, try guessing how we pronounce North Versailles.
Allegheny- AL - UH - GAY - KNEE
Monongahela- MAH - NON - GAH - HEY - LA
1) Gateway Clipper
Climb aboard a member of the Gateway Clipper Fleet for an unforgettable tour around the city. Offering dining cruises, sightseeing cruises, kids themed cruises, private events (I've had multiple school dances and weddings aboard this fleet), these riverboats sail across the shores of Downtown allowing guests to get the best views of PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Point State Park fountain!

2) Boat Charters &amp; Rentals
Let Captain Bob Rush take the wheel and your group on a chauffeured pleasure cruise for you and up to six passengers with Rush Hour Boat Charter. Cruises go for two hours throughout the day, plus sunset cruises are available as well as sailgating before and during massive concerts in the Burgh.
Look at me. Are you the captain now? Chart your own course through Pittsburgh Boat Rental! Rent an 18‚Äô party barge that seats nine or pontoon boat that seats eight and cruise around to get one of a kind views of the city. Rentals are available from sunrise to sunset for fun with friends and family in 3-, 4- or 8-hour time slots.

3) Kayak Pittsburgh
Paddle through the Three Rivers with Kayak Pittsburgh! Soak up the sun and the Downtown city views solo, grab a friend for a tandem kayak through Sharpsburg or take a relaxing pedal boat through North Park Lake. Also, be sure to look for special trips including guided tours, their paddle &amp; pints series with a craft beer flair and introductions to kayak fishing. These rentals are fantastic for families, date day trips and large groups who love being active!
Pro-Tip: I love to start my kayak rental and head upstream while I'm still full of energy, then gently float back to shore on my return trip and enjoy the views.

4) Cruisin' Tikis
Forget that trip to the islands and set sail on a Hawaiian-style tiki boat cruise through the city‚Äôs water ways with five of your closest family or friends! On your tropical daycation, spend two hours leisurely floating around the city‚Äôs rivers in a tiki hut equipped with Bluetooth speakers. Crusin‚Äô Tikis has brought the tropics to the city of champions!
Be sure to BOOK IN ADVANCE. These trips sell out weeks in advance, especially in the summer months.
Pro Tip: Bigger group? Two boats can be tied together to suit your party of up to 12.
5) Rivers of Steel
Temporarily Suspended. Check back for updates.
All aboard! Rivers of Steel offers sightseeing tours, corporate charters and student education aboard the world's first green passenger riverboat. The Uniquely Pittsburgh Sightseeing Tour explores what makes Pittsburgh so special historically and how the city‚Äôs residents and workers are shaping this dynamic city all while cruising through its rivers! The best part? Proceeds from the tour aid student STEM education programs.
Pro Tip: Look for special events on their website like the Birdwatching Cruise with the National Aviary in the summer and The Hardest Working River Tour in October for uniquely Pittsburgh experiences.

6) Pittsburgh Party Boat Company
You can see the distinct black and gold-painted Pittsburgh Party Boat Company daily in our three rivers hosting birthdays, team buildings, bachelor/bachelorette parties and anything else you can think of! BYOB, snacks and up to 18 guests for this 1 hour 45-minute tour of the city! Pedal boats seating 14 can also be rented here to keep your friends and loved ones active between sips.

7) Steel City Jet Skis
Have that need for speed? Adrenaline junkies can see the best of our three rivers blur by as you go from Sharpsburg to the Point on these thrilling jet skis. Passengers ride for free, so your rental can easily accommodate you and another guest or you and two kids.
Pro Tip: There's a no wake zone in effect near the Point from Friday afternoon until early Monday, so book your trip during the weekday so you never have to let up on the throttle.

8) USS Requin at the Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center
Ok, so the submarine doesn't go anywhere, but that doesn't make this stop any less essential to being a Pittsburgher. Come on board (admission is included with your Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center ticket), head below decks and discover how 80 men served on this WW2-era sub that you can explore from the torpedo room up front to the stern room in the back.
9) Dragon Boat Racing
The ancient tradition of Dragon Boat Racing (going back more than 2,000 years) has finally made its way to our rivers! The Steel City Dragons offer a free paddling lesson and introduction to the sport at the Fox Chapel Yacht Club. Dragon boats are propelled by 20 paddlers all moving to the beat of a drummer sitting in the front while a steerer keeps the dragon boat on course.
