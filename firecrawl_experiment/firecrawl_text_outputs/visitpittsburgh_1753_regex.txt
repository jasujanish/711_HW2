About the Mon Incline
Picture this: It's the late 1800s, and Pittsburgh is a bustling hub of industry and innovation. The steel mills are roaring, the rivers are bustling with barges and the city's hills are filled with hardworking folks who need a quicker way to commute. Enter the Monongahela Incline, the brainchild of engineer John Endres and his daughter, Caroline.
Opened in 1870, this incline railway was a game-changer, whisking passengers up and down Mount Washington with style and efficiency. Imagine wooden cars clattering along steel tracks, powered by a robust steam engine, giving riders a scenic view of the burgeoning city below. It was the coolest ride in town!
But the Monongahela Incline isn't just a historical artifact; it's a living, breathing piece of Pittsburgh's soul. Over the years, it's been upgraded and modernized, yet it still retains that vintage charm. Today, it travels 635 feet along a 35 degree grade at a pleasant six miles per hour, carrying local commuters and tourists alike.
But the Monongahela Incline is more than just transportationâ€”it's an experience. It's about feeling the history under your feet, seeing the city from a new perspective, and being part of a tradition that's more than 150 years strong.

Insider's Tips
Sit in the very front- There's not a bad view on your ride, but for the very best views, sit towards the front for the most unobscured views of the city (board at the bottom of the car)
Bring cash - The fare machines can get backed up during the busiest times of day. Bring exact change or use the ticketing on the ready2ride app to spend less time paying and more time riding.
Bikes are ok- the Mon Incline can accommodate one bike per ride on the upper level of the car. This includes ebikes. Battery-powered scooters, however, are not permitted.
The West car is wheelchair accessible - making the Mon Incline accessible for all.
Every season is worth a visit - While most people travel during the summer, don't forget about the Mon Incline the rest of the year. This is one of the most scenic rides to enjoy fall colors or a gentle snowfall as it blankets the Burgh.
Take advantage of your three-hour pass - Because you aren't buying one- or two-way tickets on the Mon Incline, enjoy the time you have. Feel free to ride to the top, explore the views at your leisure, grab something to eat and ride back down. You have tons of time!
Go at dawn- Skip the crowds and enjoy the sunrise. Dawn is pretty quiet on the Mon Incline but one of the best times for photos.
The best place to watch fireworks - Pittsburgh loves fireworks, and not just for the 4th of July. If you want to avoid Downtown, consider watching the fireworks from the top of Mt. Washington via a Mon Incline ride.

Explore Shiloh Street & Scenic Lookouts
One of the best parts of the Mon Incline is that, no matter which station you're at, you're in a hotbed of things to do. Once you exit the Upper Station, your first priority is to take in the views and snag all the photos of scenic lookouts.
But don't be in a hurry to head back down! Instead, walk along Shiloh Street and you'll be treated to a bevy of small businesses perfect to spend an afternoon or evening at. Grab street corn and fish tacos at Gordo's that are straight ðŸ”¥. Treat the kids to ice cream at DiFiore's. Or meet up with friends for drinks with innovative cocktails at Coughlin's Law.
Don't forget to grab some souvenirs at love, Pittsburgh's boutique before returning to the bottom!

Your Gateway to the Clipper and Station Square
The fun doesn't end at the Lower Station of the Mon Incline, either. In fact, your night could just be beginning! Cross the street at the bottom and you've reached Station Square, a sprawling, 52-acre riverfront complex with upscale dining, entertainment and unparalleled river access.
Dine at the Grand Concourse, a former train station converted into a stunning upscale restaurant that will be the talk of your trip. On Saturdays, be on the lookout for a Pittsburgh Riverhounds home game and take in the sights of beautiful Highmark Stadium as our soccer team competes for USL glory.
If you want to get out on the water, Station Square is also a hotspot to enjoying our three rivers. The iconic Gateway Clipper fleet boards here, and it's also where you can find Pittsburgh Party Boat Company, Cruisin' TIkis and Rush Hour Boat Charters for the best way to move your excursion out to the rivers.
So next time you're in Pittsburgh, hop on the Monongahela Incline and let it whisk you away on a trip through time. Feel the excitement, embrace the heritage, and enjoy the ride!
