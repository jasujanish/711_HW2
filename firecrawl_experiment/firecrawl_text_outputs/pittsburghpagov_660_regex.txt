Wightman Park Improvement Project
Set to begin this year, the much-anticipated rehabilitation of Wightman Park in Squirrel Hill will create a safer, cleaner, greener, and more accessible space. Through in-person meetings and online engagement, neighborhood residents, frequent park users, and the stakeholders helped to develop a vision to revitalize this community asset that has not received major investments in two decades. The Wightman Park Improvement Project is being carried out by the City of Pittsburgh, City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works, Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, Pashek+ MTR, and Ethos Collaborative.
Additional neighborhood meetings and community pop-up events will be scheduled throughout 2018 during the design and construction phases. Stay tuned to this website for details on the meetings and events.
