Start Here - Mac Miller, August Wilson & Strawberry Way
Pittsburgh's mural scene is ever-evolving, with new creations popping up across the city, from sprawling works that take up an entire building to street art that practically pops up overnight.
The newest Mac Miller mural, located on the side of ID Labs in Etna where he recorded, is a stunning homage to the Pittsburgh rapper. Pictures don't do it justice; there are details and easter eggs chronicling Miller's brief but impactful career you can only notice in person. Artist Gustavo Zermeño Jr. might be a California native but this mural makes him welcome at Blue Slide Park anytime.
James "Yaya" Hough's A Gift to the Hill District celebrates the historic neighborhood with a tableau of evocative scenes and words that challenge the viewer. The story behind it's creation makes this mural even more impactful, as the Pittsburgh-based artist created this piece in collaboration with the community, holding workshops and paint days to create each panel.
Rainbow Road isn't just a Mario Kart course anymore. Strawberry Way got a complete overhaul in 2022! Nearly 40 grade school students combined efforts to complete individual sections, then each part was linked together through an intricate rainbow motif over 440 feet of walkway. I recommend starting at Grant and walking the entire way through to Liberty for the full experience (Bonus Art: Look up at the intersection of Liberty and Strawberry for The Two Andys mural, a playful imagination of Pittsburgh's Andy Warhol and Andrew Carnegie at the beauty salon).

Pop Culture Explosion - From Warhol to Savini and Magneto
There's a joy in discovering new murals, especially when the subject is something so recognizable and exciting you pull the car over to get your photo.
Perhaps the best example of this is the 2,000 square-foot portrait of Pittsburgh horror icon Tom Savini in Lawrenceville. Savini holds the signature Jason Voorhees mask he created for the Friday the 13th films in this towering tribute by artist Jeremy Raymer (learn more about our horror heritage).
Raymer's works can be found all over the city, but my favorites are all within walking distance of each other. Start by discovering the X-Men villain Magneto who an be found bending the walls and gates of AAA Scrap Iron on Penn.
From there, head towards Lawrenceville on Butler for a small park surrounded by Raymer creations, including a photo-op favorite Home Alone mural. Walk to the Savini mural noting other murals tucked into alleyways, then walk back along Charlotte St. to discover this small streets loaded with Raymers. Slimer, Home Simpson, Mr. Burns and a super-fun pixel version of Andy Warhol are just some of my favorites you'll see on this stretch.
Sports Heroes
For many of us, the story of Pittsburgh is told through the legends that played here. Artist Kyle Holbrook (more on him below) made the showstopping mural of Roberto Clemente that adorns the side of the The Clemente Museum, a sight which has made even the most hardened Yinzers leave with a tear in their eye. Like other murals, this collaboration involved the community contributing small details, so it's worth parking the car and looking all of the hidden pictures contained within.
Other must-see baseball murals include The Legends of Pittsburgh, featuring some of the best Pirates players all-time hidden under the Boulevard of the Allies with a replication of the outfield wall of Forbes Field. While you're exploring the Homestead neighborhood, check out Raymer's mural of MLB Hall of Famer and Negro League star Josh Gibson.
Insider Tip: Former Steelers running back-turned-artist Baron Batch has murals that can be seen throughout the city, but be sure to follow him on Instagram. He will sometimes give away prints of his artwork through clues and photos posted on his social media.

The Homewood Experience: The Artwalk
Pittsburgh’s Homewood neighborhood launched The Homewood Experience, a neighborhood initiative dedicated to preserving history and instilling pride through community engagement, businesses development, sustainability and cultural integrity. The Artwalk, an initiative highlight, invites residents and visitors to explore Homewood by way of outdoor murals.
The Artwalk currently features 11 murals created by four different artists, including The Artwalk Coordinator and Homewood native Camerin “CAMO” Nesbit. His feature pieces include the Homewood is Home and BubbleGum murals, both located along N. Homewood Avenue. The project will continue to grow as murals and artists are added.

MLK Community Mural Project
Moving the Lives of Kids (MLK) Community Mural Project is a nonprofit organization with the mission to inspire, educate and empower the youth through public art. Founded by established Pittsburgh artist and muralist Kyle Holbrook, this program aims to use public art as a means to reach kids over the summer months to do positive community work. Through the years, the project has expanded beyond Pittsburgh and into 56 cities, 27 states and 43 countries.
The beautiful, collaborative MLK Pittsburgh Murals can be found in a number of neighborhoods throughout the city. In the Hill District, you’ll find a tribute to the late Pittsburgh playwright August Wilson. The mural was created with the support of 10 students and includes each of their favorite August Wilson plays. In East Liberty, a mural honors the late Pittsburgh-native Mac Miller. In Larimer, the We Fall Down but We Get Back Up mural features portraits of East Enders, which Miller helped paint with a group in 2008.
With hundreds of Pittsburgh residents engaged, the MLK Project has created more than 40 murals throughout the city, including the murals along the MLK East Busway spanning eight neighborhoods.

Maxo Vanka - Pittsburgh's Original Muralist?
So where does the inspiration for all of Pittsburgh's murals come from? Perhaps Maxo Vanka, the Croatian-American artist who transformed St. Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church in Millvale with 25 moving murals.
While rooted in Biblical imagery, each mural tells a deeper story about American industry, war, immigration and social justice. When you realize these awesome images were painted in 1937 and 1941, it truly shows Vanka's work is timeless in one of the best hidden gems in Pittsburgh.
Sprout Fund Community Murals
The Sprout Fund was a nonprofit organization supporting innovative ideas and grassroots community projects in Pittsburgh. From 2003-2010, The Sprout Fund worked with community groups and dozens of local artists to create 56 large-scale works of public art in 39 different neighborhoods.
Located in Pittsburgh’s Garfield neighborhood, Fabrics of the Community was designed by Jackie Kresak and inspired by her mother’s quilt with the purpose of conveying the welcoming, comforting warmth of a diverse, colorful and growing community. James Maszle’s Season of Hope in Homewood also was part of The Sprout Fund. The mural is on a massive wall, measuring more than 200 feet in length highlighting Homewood residents, iconic symbols and local landmarks.
Visit The Sprout Fund website for a full listing of murals including the artists and locations.
