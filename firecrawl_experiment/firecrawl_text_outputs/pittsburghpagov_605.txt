Meetings
The City of Pittsburgh Ethics Hearing Board meets as needed to issue: advisory opinions, employment waivers, enforcement orders, settlements, regulations and proposed legislation. Public meeting times are reserved monthly. These times may instead be used for public administrative hearings (similar to trials), committee meetings, training, or for deliberations related to advisory opinions, litigation, or the Board’s quasi-judicial enforcement actions.
Meetings of the Ethics Hearing Board are conducted over video conference and in person. Please contact us for details to participate. Meeting minutes are posted below after they are approved at a subsequent, full meeting of the Board.
Anyone who requires an accommodation for effective communication or a modification of policies or procedures to participate in a program, service, or activity provided by the City of Pittsburgh should contact the Mayor's Office of Equal Protection through the ADA accommodation request form or email ada@pittsburghpa.gov.
