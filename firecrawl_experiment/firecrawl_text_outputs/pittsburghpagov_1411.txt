Frick Park Red Clay Jr. Open
Boys and girls (divisions 16, 14 and 12 &amp; under) from City neighborhoods, nearby states, around the U.S., and as far away as Madrid, Spain and Puerto Rico compete yearly in the only junior tournament held on red clay in all of western Pennsylvania.
This USTA-sanctioned event has been organized by the Frick Park Clay Court Tennis Club, a community tennis association (CTA), since 2009.
This open junior tournament accepts both City and non-City residents and has no USTA or other ranking requirements.
Entries are open and players of all levels—novice to experienced junior tournament players—are encouraged to enter.
To make the most of their tournament experience, relative novices are encouraged to participate in Junior Tournament Training Mini-Camp at Frick Park the preceding week.
