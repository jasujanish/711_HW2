Celebrate Mother's Day in Pittsburgh!
If there's one thing Pittsburgh's got a lot of, it's a love for its family scene. And, while moms are celebrated everyday, it's fun to amp up the revelry on Mother's Day.
May is a great month in Pittsburgh. Warm weather, outdoor activities and, of course, Mother’s Day. Plan a special day or weekend with your mom, wife, grandmother, mother-in-law, aunt, sister or friend. There is no shortage of fun, family-friendly things to do to show the mothers in your life a good time.
Breakfast &amp; Brunch
Treat her to breakfast at Pamela’s Diner in the Strip District. Their crepes and pancakes are scrumptious, and the old photos that line the walls give it a cozy, family atmosphere. Or visit The Speckled Egg located inside the Union Trust Building, and enjoy a delicious refined diner experience in the heart of Downtown.
For brunch, treat mom to an unforgettable Mother's Day experience at Fairmont Pittsburgh's Grand Ballroom. Savory brunch classics and decadent desserts will help you raise a toast to mom with a meal she'll never forget.
Relax at the Spa
Pamper mom on her special day by purchasing a gift certificate or scheduling an appointment for a relaxing and rejuvenating spa session at one of Pittsburgh's top wellness centers.
Izzazu Salon &amp; Spa has two area locations, one in Downtown and another in Warrendale, with services including haircuts, massages, facials and more. Also in Downtown, Spa Jema is a chic salon and spa offering a range of wellness experiences, including a sauna, deep tissue massages, nail services, and more.
For a truly luxurious Mother's Day treat, consider booking an appointment for mom at one of several serene resorts just a short drive from Downtown Pittsburgh, such as Nemacolin Woodlands Resort and Seven Springs Mountain Resort.

Travel Back in Time
Join mom for an art and history lesson at The Frick Pittsburgh, home of industrialist Henry Clay Frick from 1882–1905. This meticulously restored 22-room mansion (Clayton) features an impressive array of fine and decorative art. Tours are available by appointment. While on the museum grounds, be sure to make time to visit the Car &amp; Carriage Museum, greenhouse and café, then swing by the gift shop for a unique Mother's Day souvenir.

Looking for my crafty, hands-on activities? We have lots of options. Book a private floral arrangement workshop with the experts at Farmer's Daughter. Or get down and dirty with the Soil Sisters and find an expertly cultivated plant to grow together all summer long.

Enjoy Dinner with a View
Experience spectacular views of the city from Mt. Washington. Take the Duquesne Incline, a historic cable car and one of the only remaining funiculars in the country, up the mountain and snap a selfie of you and mom with Pittsburgh’s gorgeous skyline in the background. It’s almost as beautiful as mom!
Have dinner at one of the restaurants along Grandview Avenue, known as “Restaurant Row," such as Altius or LeMont Restaurant. Then take the Incline back down and get great nighttime photos. Parking is available at the lot on West Carson Street where you can take the stairs to board the Incline (cash only, $5 round trip for adults).
Immerse Mom in the Arts
End the day with arts, culture and entertainment as you and mom explore Pittsburgh’s vibrant Cultural District, a 14-square block encompassing more than 90 retail shops, 50 dining establishments, seven world-class theaters, eight public parks and art installations and a dozen art galleries.
