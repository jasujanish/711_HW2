Greater Hill District Master Plan
The City of Pittsburgh is working with the Hill District community to update and adopt the Greater Hill District Master Plan.
Once adopted by the Planning Commission, the Greater Hill District Master Plan will become City policy and guide public and private investments in the area. New land use regulations, transportation and infrastructure improvements, and public programs may be recommended in the plan. The plan area generally includes the neighborhoods of Crawford-Roberts, Middle Hill, Terrace Village, Bedford Dwellings, Upper Hill, and the Lower Hill.

Status
The Greater Hill District Master Plan Steering Committee spent Winter 2020 collaborating with staff to develop a Public Engagement Plan. During Winter 2020 and Spring 2020, Steering Committee meetings focused on establishing a firm baseline of knowledge about the topics of the planning process by completing a Gap analysis based on the original Greater Hill District Master Plan and the Neighborhood Plan Guide. All presentations can be found on the Steering Committee page. The next step is to engage the broader community through the City's online engagement portal - Engage PGH - to build upon the existing vision and goals for the Hill District to guide the Action Teams as they focus on the four topic areas of the plan: community, development, mobility, and infrastructure. This process will update and enhance the Greater Hill District Master Plan (2011) and incorporate other community plans including the Greenprint (2009) and the Centre Avenue Redevelopment and Design Plan (2015), adopting it as city policy.

The Neighborhood(show below)
As one of Pittsburgh’s earliest and largest neighborhoods, the Hill District continues to play an important role in the story of African-Americans in the United States. During the first half of the 20th century, the Hill District was the “crossroads of the world,” contributing music, literature, and arts that shaped American culture. During the latter half of the 20th century through today, the neighborhood and its leaders played important roles in the Civil Rights movement, as well as a nationwide push for community-led development. The Greater Hill District Master Plan articulates the importance of continuing to “Build Upon the African American Cultural Legacy”.
The Hill District Greenprint (2009) created a bold vision for a natural and healthy community, the Greater Hill District Master Plan (2011) established fundamental values and development principles that have been central to development activities and the neighborhood ecosystem. The Centre Avenue Redevelopment and Design Plan (2015)using a market study as its basis, created a detailed vision for how new development and amenities on Centre Avenue could serve a variety of community needs.
Multiple waves of development have built new office, commercial and community spaces along Centre Avenue, along with new housing throughout the neighborhood. Development activities in Downtown and Oakland have the potential to bring new opportunities and challenges to the Hill District the plan will seek to address.
