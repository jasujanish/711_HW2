How to Comply
What is the ordinance?
The Pittsburgh Building Benchmarking Ordinance requires owners of non-residential buildings over 50,000 sq. ft. to annually report their energy and water consumption to the City in a process called benchmarking.
Building owners are required to use a secure online tool developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, called ENERGY STAR Portfolio Managerâ to track their energy and water use and submit their data to the City of Pittsburgh. Building owners can obtain energy and water use from the utility companies servicing their buildings.
This data informs building owners about a building’s energy and water consumption compared to similar buildings, and track progress year after year. Owners can use this data to assist in decision making for maintenance and upgrade. In the spirit of Business Transparency, benchmarking and compliance data will be available publicly.
The Sustainability & Resilience division will publish a report in the fall summarizing the performance of Pittsburgh’s large buildings portfolio, and visually illustrate on the online platform which buildings are participating, exempted, eligible and nonparticipating, as well as buildings who chose to voluntarily participate.

What is the criteria for covered buildings?
All non-residential buildings 50,000 sq. ft. or greater are required to report utility data to the City of Pittsburgh using ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager in accordance with Pittsburgh Code §629.
Few USPS postal addresses might be listed in Pittsburgh while not being in city limits. The USPS zip code boundaries are different from the municipal boundaries. The city limits can be found in maps online, including this Pittsburgh Neighborhoods map. You can enter the address in the search box in the upper right corner and find out whether the addresses is within city limits.
This table contains all the buildings expected to comply. If your building meets the criteria but is not listed, you should still comply and contact us through 3-1-1.

How do you get your building utility data?
The easiest way to collect your utility data for the 12 months is to log in to your online accounts for electricity, gas and water. If you do not already use their online portals, you will need to create a profile linked to your billing account and your past data will be available. To create a new profile, have one of your bills with the account number ready and follow the step-by-step onscreen instructions. Repeat for each new online utility account needed. For district energy such as steam, usage is available upon email request to your energy district provider.
