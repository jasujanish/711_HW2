Where Do We Eat
With the move to the Strip District, there are plenty of new dining options right outside of the festival.
If you are looking for a true Pittsburgher experience, stop at the original Primanti Brother's location and get a Pitts-burger sandwich. For early birds, some of the best diners in the city are in the Strip District, like Pamela's and DeLuca's. You can also stroll along The Terminal for plenty of drink, dining and entertainment options between concerts.

Dress for the Weather
In any given year at the The Arts Festival you may need massive amounts of sunscreen, a light jacket, or an umbrella. The weather is unpredictable in June, but Pittsburghers are down to enjoy the festivities no matter what it's like outside. This festival and all performances run rain or shine, but keep an eye on social media for any changes to the schedule.
Best Time to Go
The festival's hours are 12-9 p.m. every day, giving you a ton of time to explore. If you want space to admire all of the inspiring art, going over lunch time is a great way to beat the crowds. For the featured music performances, check out the full schedule and make sure to plan enough time for parking and grabbing that perfect viewing spot.

Parking &amp; Transportation
You have plenty of options to get to the Three Rivers Arts Festival. Public transportation is available through the Pittsburgh Regional Transit by bus, light rail and the incline, and there are several stops in the Strip District or within easy walking distance. Biking is a great option as well thanks to Pittsburgh's dedicated bike lanes. If you want to part away from the hustle and bustle of the festival, check out some places across the Allegheny River to park before taking a quick walk across a bridge to get to the Strip.
If you're driving, make sure to download the ParkPGH app for real-time the availability at downtown garages. For more information, check out our transportation page.
