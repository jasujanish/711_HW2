About the Community-Based Work Coalition
The Community-Based Work Coalition (CBWC) is a network of faculty, staff, researchers, and administrators whose work directly intersects with the broader regional community. The coalition aims to establish a baseline understanding of the breadth of community-based work at the university, increase coordination between the connectivity with already-established efforts and/or partnerships, and reduce potential duplication. As a group, coalition members surface common challenges, brainstorm solutions, and support each other's work. Occasionally, the CBWC may provide feedback to university leadership and spin out working groups as needed.
Typically the coalition meets monthly, with no meetings in the summer. To accommodate this university-wide group, meeting times, dates, and locations vary. Generally, content for CBWC meetings is driven by participants, with occasional topical discussions.
All interested faculty and staff are welcome to join the CBWC.
Community-Based Work Coalition Member Directory
To support university collaboration and community engagement, the Community-Based Work Coalition directory serves as a guidepost for making connections with CMU faculty and staff involved in outreach, research, and programs with our broader regional community. The directory includes CBWC members who opt into sharing their information and are open to collaboration and/or supporting others with similar interests. Directory listings use the university's 18 Indicators of Impact to describe their work.
If you have work that youâ€™d like featured, join the directory.
