Fee Calculator
Listed below are fee calculators for you to use so that you can predict the cost of an application before applying. PLI will verify the final cost of your application based on our most current fee schedule both when you apply for your permit and again when your permit is issued. These calculators are subject to change at any time.
Please see our Fee Schedule page for the most up-to-date Fee Schedule, Fee definitions, how to calculate your value of construction, and more.
Zoning Fees may apply to permit scopes. Please consult the Zoning Fee Schedule.
