Find Your Home in Local Neighborhoods
All first-year CMU undergraduate students live on campus, but many upperclassmen and graduate students discover their home away from home in nearby neighborhoods. From the tree-lined streets of Shadyside and the bustling eateries of Squirrel Hill to the academic and cultural hub of Oakland, each area offers its own unique character and conveniences.
A major perk? Pittsburgh's housing affordability. According to Apartments.com, the average rent in the city is 15% lower than the national average, stretching your budget further.
