President's Advisory Boards
Message from President Farnam Jahanian
Carnegie Mellon is an innovative and dynamic university that seeks continual improvement in all that it does. The Advisory Boards play an important role by stimulating us to review critically what we do and by providing us their collective insights and recommendations.
Carnegie Mellon is unquestionably better as a result of these Advisory Boards. They not only help us to carry out our mission more effectively, but they are critical in helping us to rise to new levels of excellence.
