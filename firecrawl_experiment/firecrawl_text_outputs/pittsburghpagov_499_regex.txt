Board Members and Meetings
Governmental ethics agencies, like Pittsburghâ€™s Ethics Hearing Board (EHB), primarily function to provide advice on a broad range of conflict of interest laws. Public service is a public trust. We aim to ensure public positions are used to further the public interest and not manipulated for private gain.
For public officials and employees to be able to identify when to request advice, ongoing training and education is offered by the Board on governmental ethics laws regulating their conduct and mandating disclosures before, during, and after public service. When necessary, compliance is achieved by the Board through confidential complaints, investigation, and enforcement.
Our mission is to preserve the trust placed in the public servants of the City of Pittsburgh, to promote public confidence in government, to protect the integrity of government decision making, and to enhance government efficiency.
