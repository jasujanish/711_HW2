Pittsburgh has lots of beautiful parks and scenic trails where you can stretch and loosen up for the big race. Point State Park sits in the middle of Downtown and has great views of the city and Pittsburgh's three rivers. North Shore Riverfront Park and Trail is an easy walk along the river across from the convention center, and the Three Rivers Heritage Trail is a 24-mile multi-use riverfront trail with access to city neighborhoods and local attractions.
