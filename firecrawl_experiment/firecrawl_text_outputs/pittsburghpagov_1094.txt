Checklists
PLI Review Checklist
These checklists are identical to those used by PLI staff to evaluate permit applications. Applicants do not need to submit a completed checklist with their submission. We have published these checklists to provide guidance to design professionals as to the code requirements PLI focuses on during the review process and critical information to include.
Please note that some checklist items are for internal reference only and can be ignored. Each spreadsheet includes a table of contents listing the structure type, permit type, included checklists, applicability for each checklist and legend of referenced codes.
More checklists are coming! Thanks for your patience as we continue to add checklists.
