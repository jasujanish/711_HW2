13 New Year’s Traditions and Superstitions
An empty suitcase could mean travel in 2024!
Before I get started, let me introduce myself. I am Barb, 65-years-young, African-American who was born, raised and educated in Pittsburgh. I currently work for VisitPITTSBURGH as the Destination and Visitors Services Manager. I grew up in a family that believed in and practiced many superstitions – everyday as well as New Year’s superstitions. While I do not walk under ladders, I do bless a sneeze, and 13 is sort of my lucky number.

Rounded up below are 13 of the most popular New Year's traditions and superstitions for your consideration:

Kiss at Midnight- The person you kiss at midnight will be your lifelong love.

Thoughts: Two thoughts. One, it's all about the location when considering your first kiss. Here's some hints, Two, would this work with your dog, cat, ferret or bird? I think they do, so why not consider pet adoption! Animal Friends or Humane Animal Rescue both offer adoption services. Not ready to pull the trigger on this one? Donate so they can continue providing services.

12 Grapes at Midnight - One grape for each month to bring year-long good luck.

Thought: I’m thinking 12 ounces of wine could do the trick, so let’s go local! Engine House 25 offers a variety of red and white hand-crafted wines. I recommend stopping in this year for a tasting and charcuterie board. Yum!

Fill Your Kitchen Cabinets- It's bad luck to start the new year with no food.
Thought: Grocery shopping New Year's Eve is the new date night. Make a run to the Strip District for all your New Year's needs: cheese from Pennsylvania Macaroni Company; halal foods from Salem's; Asian staples from Lotus; all your fish from Wholey’s; all your Greek food staples from Stamoolis Brothers Co. and so much more!

Why stop there? Make a donation to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and make sure your neighbors also have full cabinets for the new year.

Have Cash in Your Wallet - To experience prosperity in the new year, you must have cash in your wallet.
Thought: Does that include all the gift cards and certificates I've accumulated in my personal mission to support all my local favorite businesses? They are cash equivalent, right?

Don't Clean the House on New Year’s Day - You will wash away any good luck coming your way.
Thought: No problem – never have to tell me twice on this one! I have plans to pick up my favorite knitting magazines, maybe a new romance novel (procured from a cute local bookstore) and on New Year’s Day I’ll be listening to my smooth jazz albums while contemplating my next knit project (with hand-dyed yarn from Songbird Artistry).

Open the Doors and/or Windows at Midnight - Let the old year and bad spirits out.
Thought: A little fresh air never hurts; it could even help rid your house of the smell of dinner you burned the night before. Where do all of those spirits end up? That's Haunted Pittsburgh Ghost Tour's business.

Eat Collard Greens and Black-Eyed Peas - Collards represent cash, and black-eyed peas represent coin to bring wealth in the new year.

Thought: Stock up on these! Go vegan at least once a week to keep the cash flow coming!

The First Person to Enter Your Home - A dark-haired male should be the first person to cross the threshold bringing good luck and a gift.
Thought: Easy…I will call my son to say, "Come visit your mother and bring my granddaughter with you!" As for my gift, it better be something local from my list.

Don’t Eat Lobster, Crab or Chicken - Lobsters walk backwards; crabs walk sideways; and because chickens have wings, your good luck could “fly away.”
Thought: Stick with the pig because he always moves forward – plus, I have a delicious pork chop recipe! And another run to the Strip District to get pork from Strip District Meats. They have a huge variety of beef, pork and lamb, as well as smoked meats. Visit their website and pick a recommended recipe to try, then go visit in person. For the more adventurous, Strip District Meats also offers a wide variety of exotic meats including elk, emu and venison!

Make Some Noise - Scare away any evil spirits.
    Thought: Don’t have noisemakers…stack up some pots and pans then accidentally knock them over. That would scare the bejesus out of anybody! Plus, Downtown Pittsburgh will have enough fireworks going off during First Night to scare out any spirits in a 100-mile radius.

Write Down Your Wishes, Hopes and Dreams - Then burn the paper ensuring they come true.
    Thought: Keep it small…otherwise the first person to cross your threshold might be a tall, dark, handsome fireman! Bonus points if you use cute stationery from Love, Pittsburgh and Kards Unlimited.

Start a New Calendar - Throw away last year’s calendars and open up new ones.

In case you are wondering, I’m trying my hardest not to repeat last year! I plan to eat/drink grapes on New Year’s Eve, and I will be making pork chops, black-eyed peas and collards on New Year’s Day. And, I will NOT be doing anything that remotely resembles work. Happy New Year!
