Office of the President
Members of the Office of the President serve as points of contact for planning and guiding the initiatives and activities of the president as they relate to internal operations and global external relationships. CMU community members are encouraged to reach out early in the event planning process if they wish to invite the president, the provost or other senior staff to attend an event.
