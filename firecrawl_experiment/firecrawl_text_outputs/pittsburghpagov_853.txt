Adopt-A-Lot Intake Form
Adopt-A-Lot is a land leasing program for temporary use of vacant city-owned property. Please review the Vacant Lot Toolkit and our Adopt-A-Lot home page for more information on our program before submitting an intake form.
Once this form is completed, the Open Space Specialist will verify that the lot(s) you requested is available by ensuring that there are no current development plans or purchase applications before a site is approved. If your lot(s) is approved for adoption, the Open Space Specialist will invite you to complete an application.
