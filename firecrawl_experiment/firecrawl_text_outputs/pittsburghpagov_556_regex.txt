Overview
Welcome to the Municipal Pension Fund site for City of Pittsburgh Employees. The purpose of this site is to provide plan members with references that address most of the issues and questions you might have regarding your pension.
The online version of the handbook will provide a Question and Answer format grouped under topic headings, such as Retirement Benefits or Types of Pensions. This format allows the reader to focus in on a specific topic of interest. Also included in this site are reprints of the entire Pension Act of 1975 as well as Ordinances 13 & 14 of 1987 which together comprise the legislative authority and rules of the Plan.
While this resource may not provide comprehensive answers to all pension concerns, it does address those most frequently asked and clarifies concepts.
