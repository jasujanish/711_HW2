Are you in town for a musical, symphony, or other excellent live theatre performance at the Cultural District? Fantastic dining options surround you within easy walking distance of our theatres. Consider the following streets, and remember to make reservations in advance:

Sixth Street - Restaurants line both sides of the street and extend into outdoor patios, making this a foodie heaven. International cuisine at gi-jin (Japanese), tako (Mexican), Alihan's (Mediterranean), and Cafe Milano (Italian) join American favorites Sally Ann's, Redbeard's, Olive Or Twist, and Giovanni's (home of the pickle pizza).
Penn Avenue - When you exit the Theatre Square Garage for a show, great restaurants are to your left and right. Gaucho Parilla Argentina, Con Alma, Rib Room, and Meat &amp; Potatoes are closest to the major theatres, but it's also worth a farther walk down to Nicky's Thai Kitchen or Bridges &amp; Bourbon as well.
Liberty Avenue - The next block down from Penn also has some local favorites. Grab a giant slice from Pizza Parma or the usual from Mike &amp; Tony's Gyros, or go upscale at the flavor-packed Bae Bae's Kitchen.
Strawberry Way - One of the best walks in the city is to park at the US Steel Building and walk down the pedestrian-only Strawberry Way, enjoying the mural that encompasses each step. A fantastic sit-down dinner at The Commoner or the best hot dog in the city at Wiener World make this walk perfect.
