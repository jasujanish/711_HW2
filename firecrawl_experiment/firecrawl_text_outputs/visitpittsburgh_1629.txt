Apple Picking &amp; Pumpkin Patches: Day Trips from Pittsburgh for Fall Fun
The air is getting crispy and the sunsets are getting earlier. Are you ready for fall?
In my opinion, it's never too early to break out your sweaters and start planning your trips to the pumpkin patch or apple orchard. Pittsburgh has plenty of options for those fall outings you've been looking forward to all year, including several locations that will act as your one-stop-shop for all your picking pleasures.
Pumpkin Patches
Trax Farms
Location: Finleyville, PA
Hours: Monday-Sunday, 10am-6pm
Fall Fest: Every Saturday &amp; Sunday Sept. 20 - Oct. 26, 2025, 10am - 5pm
My personal bias is that Trax is the best pumpkin patch in the Pittsburgh area. I'm not saying that as a knock on all the others; I just love all that Trax has to offer. From wine tastings to hayrides, dreamy fall and winter candles to fresh produce and flowers, Trax really has it all. I think of all the pumpkin patches I've been to in the Pittsburgh area, Trax has the best selection of pumpkins even as Halloween draws closer; I've gone as close as four days before Halloween and still got several pumpkins that I carved. Their pumpkin piles also make for great photo spots (as pictured).
And when the air gets a little too chilly, the inside of Trax features must-sees and must-buys for the whole family. I recommend going early so you can check out the thrift/antique store on the second floor. I also recommend leaving with a giant bag of kettlecorn popcorn to tie you over for the fall months.
Trax also has a Fall Fest filled with activities for the whole family, which you can learn more about here.

Soergel Orchards
Location: Wexford, PA
Hours: Monday-Sunday, 9am-6pm
Harvest Schedule: Flower fields open Saturday, Sept. 14, 2025. Pick your own apples and pumpkins Sept-Oct. Pick your own blueberries July-Aug.
At Soergels, you get the best of both worlds in the form of a pumpkin patch and an apple orchard. I've personally never been apple picking there, so I can't vouch for the experience, but I can tell you that I make sure to get some sour apples every time I go to get pumpkins.
Walking through Soergels on a crisp fall day feels like walking through an autumn wonderland. There are shops designed like little cottages, farm animals you can interact with, a market where you can get fresh produce, and a greenhouse for all of your flowery needs. The pumpkin patch is up on a hill, with a gorgeous view of the landscape that makes for a great backdrop for your photos. It's been to go early in the season to get your best pick of the patch, and I cannot stress enough: wear comfortable shoes! I made the mistake of wearing heeled boots once, and I'll never do it again.
Bedner's Farm Market
Location: Upper St. Clair, PA
Hours: Market open daily 10am-5pm
Bedner's isn't a pumpkin patch per se, but they've got plenty of pumpkins to go around. Conveniently located on Bower Hill Road at the edge of Upper St. Clair and Bridgeville with ample parking, Bedner's offers always fresh in-season selections from their farm in Mercer, PA, just over an hour north of Pittsburgh. If you're looking for more opportunities to pick your own produce, Bedner's Farm and Greenhouse in Cecil Township offers pick-your-own tomatoes, peppers, herbs, and more.
