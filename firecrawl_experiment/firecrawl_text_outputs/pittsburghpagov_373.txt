Who Are We?
Our Mission
The Pittsburgh LGBTQIA+ Commission advises the Mayorâ€™s Office, City Council, and other City government departments on issues pertaining to the Pittsburgh LGBTQIA+ community. In addition to advising city government on legislative, administrative, and budgetary decisions, the Commission acts as a resource to create dialogue by elevating LGBTQIA+ voices and advancing communication between the LGBTQIA+ community and city government.
