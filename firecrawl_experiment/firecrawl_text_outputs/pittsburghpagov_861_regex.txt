23RD ANNUAL Gingerbread House Competition Accepting Entries Beginning October 1
Pittsburgh, PA – The CitiParks Office of Special Events is pleased to announce that registration for the 23rd Annual City of Pittsburgh Gingerbread House Competition opened today, Wednesday, October 1.
Individuals, schools, communities, non-profits, and professionals across the region are invited to express their creativity through the display, a treasured tradition that has become a feature of celebrating the holiday season in Pittsburgh.
In continued partnership, Clearview Federal Credit Union will once again present the City of Pittsburgh’s official holiday events, including the 23rd Annual Gingerbread Display and Competition as well as the 110th Tree Lighting Ceremony to illuminate the only live holiday tree in downtown.
“Clearview is dedicated to creating connections that strengthen communities,” said Erin Forrester, Assistant Vice President, Public Relations & Community Engagement. “The Gingerbread House Competition and Tree Lighting reflect that commitment, bringing neighbors together to share in generosity, imagination, and the joy of the season. These traditions highlight the spirit of Pittsburgh and the relationships that make it a vibrant city. With our Strip District financial center now open and Market Square set to welcome members this November, Clearview is excited to expand its presence downtown and create even more opportunities for people to gather and thrive together.”
This year’s display at the City County Building will open with a ceremony on Friday, November 21, with the entries remaining displayed for Light Up Night on November 22 and through early January. In addition to nearly 20 categories, participants will also be eligible for overall awards such as the “Clearview Choice”, voted on by Clearview representatives, and “Curator’s Choice” selected by Carnegie Museum of Art.
This annual competition began with downtown Pittsburgh hotels in 2002 to benefit the Children’s Hospital Free Care Fund, and since has attracted thousands of entries and visitors to PPG Place before moving to the City-County Building in 2019.
The Gingerbread House Display and Competition is also made possible with media support from KDKA Radio, 100.7 Star, Y108, WAMO 107.3, and 93.7 The Fan.
