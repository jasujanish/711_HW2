Feasting Through Pittsburgh: My Journey & Foodie Guide \| Student Perspectives
Why the people, culture and food scene made it an easy decision to stay here for college
Hey there!
Buckle up and get ready, because I'm about to take you on a ride that spans continents, cultures and some seriously mouthwatering cuisine. Picture this: leaving behind the bustling streets of Beijing, China, only to find myself in a city renowned for its steel heritage, vibrant neighborhoods and a culinary scene that has captured my heart for nearly a decade.
This is my story ‚Äì I'm Sissi Hai, an international student who set foot in Pittsburgh nine years ago. As I gear up to celebrate this milestone, I'm excited to share my personal journey of growth, my deep-seated affection for the 'Burgh and my ultimate foodie guide to navigating the city's incredible culinary landscape.
Cuisines that Cross Continents
Growing up in the vibrant streets of Beijing, a city with a food scene like no other, my palate was exposed to a world of flavors from an early age and gifted me with the passion and appreciation for cultural cuisine. The bustling food markets, aromatic street stalls and diverse culinary traditions that thrived in my hometown fostered a deep appreciation for a wide range of tastes.
However, my journey did not stop in Beijing, it traveled across the continent to this amazing city I call home today, Pittsburgh. Remarkably, this city has managed to satisfy my discerning taste buds in ways I couldn't have anticipated. The eclectic food scene here, a harmonious medley of cuisines, has offered me a new palette of experiences.

Making Pittsburgh my Home
Relocating across the continent as a young girl was no small feat; it felt as though I had been torn from the comforting embrace of home and thrust into an entirely new world. Yet, Pittsburgh has effortlessly kindled my affection. The peaceful towns on the outskirts of the city are among the most serene places one could live in. The allure of the scenery, the tranquil yet vibrant streets of Downtown and the lively burst of colors in the Strip District, brimming with joyous souls, all conspired to make this place my true home.
When people question my choice to stay in Pittsburgh for college, I've engaged in spirited discussions about the city's appeal. To me, Pittsburgh offers an abundance of reasons. From its culinary scene, the people here and their sports, to the captivating stories and rich history embedded in its streets, this city will make you wonder why you would ever leave.
Whenever I'm asked about my favorite aspect of being here, my immediate response is the people. There's an undeniable warmth and kindness in everyone I've met, and it's what truly makes this place feel like home.
Pitt Student Hangouts
Pittsburgh has consistently held its place as one of the best places to live, and within its embrace, I've found my second home at the University of Pittsburgh. The University of Pittsburgh's campus is a vibrant gathering of diverse and passionate students. Situated at the core of Pittsburgh, these college campuses infuse the city with a lively spirit, making it THE place to be. If you are traveling to Pittsburgh or want to explore the city, here are a few of my favorite places to be around my college campus.
Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens- a haven of natural wonder, offers free admission to Pittsburgh college students. Its lush landscapes host some of the most exquisite flowers and captivating displays.
Carnegie Museum of Art and Natural History- an iconic cultural institution in Pittsburgh, promises a captivating journey through art, history and the wonders of the natural world.
Point State Park - stands as a pivotal marker where the convergence of three rivers takes center stage. The mesmerizing scenery it offers is nothing short of breathtaking, with the city's skyline as a backdrop and the rivers intertwining before your eyes.
If your schedule permits, I highly recommend taking a ride on the Gateway Clipper. It's a wonderful way to soak in the city's views and experience Pittsburgh from a unique perspective.
With that said, here's my comprehensive foodie guide, organized into different categories. From exploring cultural cuisines, visiting iconic spots, I've also included my personal favorites and must-try restaurants.

Pittsburgh is where my story, and the stories of countless others, began. Pittsburgh, a city of multitudes, will always hold a special place in my heart.
