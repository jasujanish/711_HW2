Historic Preservation Program
Pittsburgh's cultural heritage is the City's legacy, formed by its people, place, neighborhoods, buildings, landscapes, objects, and stories -- everything that helped to shape Pittsburgh, literally and figuratively, from the beginning. Cultural and historic resources have a significant impact on Pittsburgh's character. They are valuable, non-replaceable assets that contribute to a unique and distinct sense of place.
City Planning's Historic Preservation work is guided by PreservePGH, the Pittsburgh Cultural Heritage Plan, completed in 2012. PreservePGH's vision statement:
In the 21st century, Pittsburgh's distinct character and culture will be preserved in ways that contribute to a high quality of life. The City will offer a balance of tradition and innovation, preservation and new construction, environmental sensitivity and continued use of resources. Pittsburgh's place in history will be admired and reflected for centuries to come - in the City's historic structures - in the waters of the three rivers - in the materials of modern buildings - in the hearts and minds of all Pittsburghers.
