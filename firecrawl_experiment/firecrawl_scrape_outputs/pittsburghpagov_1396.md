## Economic Benefits

Historic preservation plays a vital role in communities across Pennsylvania, providing a multitude of benefits for the Commonwealth and its residents. One category of benefits associated with historic preservation activities is economic benefits. Historic preservation efforts can have significant positive impacts on property values, downtown revitalization, tourism, job creation, and tax revenue generation.

This project was support by a Preserve America grant from the National Park Service and administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.
