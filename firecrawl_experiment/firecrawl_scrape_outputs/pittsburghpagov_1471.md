Pittsburgh's Market Square is the heart of Downtown Pittsburgh. Located between Fifth Avenue and PPG Place, the historic Square is home to restaurants and entertainment. It is a popular gathering spot for civic events and the Downtown community. The Square is programmed in cooperation with the **Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership**.

**Market Square was laid out by surveyor George Wood in 1784.** The first Allegheny County Courthouse was constructed in the square along with a horseshoe-shaped market in the 1790s. In 1852 both structures were replaced with a new Pittsburgh City Hall and market, called Diamond Market. Finally, in 1914, these structures were replaced with a final market house that was razed in 1961.

Over the decades the square was remodeled and reimagined, transforming into an open-air multipurpose space in the heart of the city. Traffic through the square was eliminated in 2009 to create a more pedestrian-friendly space.

Summer in the Square is a beloved part of the Downtown Pittsburgh experience. Events sponsored by the City of Pittsburgh and Downtown Partnership fill the Square with life each year.
