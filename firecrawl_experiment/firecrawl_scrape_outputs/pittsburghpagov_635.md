## About the MBK Initiative

My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) Pittsburgh is an initiative that [originated from the Obama administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/my-brothers-keeper#section-about-my-brothers-keeper) to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color to ensure all young people can reach their full potential.

The City of Pittsburgh has embraced former President Barack Obama's call to action for “My Brother's Keeper” with Mayor Ed Gainey implementing a cross-sector alliance with commitments to join the effort in creating a moreequitable and inclusive Pittsburgh.

The MBK advisory committee and staff members consistently review demographic, social, economic, and crime data, including numerous community and academic reports to strategize the work of MBK by structuring our community network to meet the needs of every Black man and boy.

## MBK Pittsburgh Vision

MBK Pittsburgh seeks to create a region where Black men and boys are safe and free from violence, feel welcome, view themselves in a positive manner, and have equitable access to opportunities that enable them to thrive.

### Goals

My Brother's Keeper seeks to address the unique challenges faced by individuals within[high- and extreme-need communities](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/99526e5b5e544f6d8f41e386bc593110) by providing a platform for mentorship, educational resources, employment opportunities, and community engagement through six key milestone goals:

1. All of our children enter school cognitively, physically, socially, and emotionally prepared
2. All of our children read at grade-level by third grade
3. All of our young people complete post-secondary education or training
4. All of our young people graduate from college
5. All of our youth who have graduated from college or a training program are employed
6. All of our young people are safe from violent crime, and those who need it, receive the second chance they deserve

Mayor Gainey and his administration are dedicated to improving current conditions within all six milestone goals through partnerships and collaboration to provide wrap-around services and resources for Black men and boys throughout the City of Pittsburgh. Together, we can foster a sense of belonging and support to empower individuals to overcome obstacles and achieve their full potential.
