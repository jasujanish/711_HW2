# Construction Management Plans

**What is a construction management plan for development review?**(show below)

A Construction Management Plan (CMP) documents how the construction operation will be handled in order to identify and mitigate any potential negative impacts early in the development review process.

**When is a construction management plan required?**(show below)

A CMP is required as part of the Zoning Review process for the following development types:

- Any new construction operation that includes a structure or multiple structures totaling more than 200,000 sq. ft. of floor area
- Any new construction operation that includes a structure or group of structures subject to Residential Compatibility Standards and that include more than 50,000 sq. ft. of floor area
- Any construction operation including new construction or exterior renovation on a lot size greater than 2,400 sq. ft. where the existing or proposed building occupies 90% or more of the lot
- Any development proposal that the Zoning Administrator determines may have significant impacts in the construction phase

**What needs to be included in a construction management plan?**(show below)

A CMP includes two key components: the scope with details and the mitigation measures.

The scope and details portion describes the operational aspects of the proposed construction work and shall include the following information:

- Transportation routing (pedestrians, bicycles and cars)
- Street and sidewalk closures and/or obstructions
- Construction circulation
- Debris/dumpster maintenance
- Work crew parking
- Site maintenance
- Duration of construction
- Any other relevant information

The mitigation portion shall explain the impacts of the proposed construction operations and will describe or show the proposed measures to reduce these impacts. These measures may include sound barriers, temporary sidewalks and sidewalk protection, dust and debris management, and construction safety plans.

The mitigation measures shall address the following topics:

- Construction noise
- Traffic
- Parking
- Air
- Light
- Any other relevant areas of potential impact

Please note that the CMP will work in conjunction with any other existing review processes or requirements including, but not limited to, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructureâ€™s requirements for street/sidewalk closure permits or MPT plans. Please contact DOMI for more information on these requirements.

**When does a construction management plan get submitted?**(show below)

A CMP should be submitted along with the Zoning and Development Review application, site plan, and other required documents as part of the [Site Plan Review](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Zoning/Plan-Reviews-and-Notices/Site-Plan-Review) or Zoning Review with [Planning Commission](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Training/DCP-BC-Archive/Planning-Commission) submission. Please note that for projects requiring Planning Commission approval, a summary of the CMP must be included as a slide in the presentation for Planning Commission.

Minor modifications and additional details may be added to the CMP during the building permit review phase, provided it is substantially similar to the original CMP approved during the Zoning Review.

**When do I talk to the neighborhood?**(show below)

The Department of City Planning encourages all applicants for any development to discuss their pending projects with their neighbors, neighborhood groups and their Council representative as early as possible.

**Why is a construction management plan required as part of the planning approval?**(show below)

In order to facilitate multi-department review, the CMP is required as part of the [Zoning Review](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Zoning/Plan-Reviews-and-Notices) process to help the applicant identify potential impacts that the construction and staging may have on the neighboring residents and businesses. The CMP review will identify needed approvals for the construction of the project, such as street and sidewalk closures, temporary occupancy or other approvals.

For projects requiring Planning Commission approval, the CMP allows the public to review and the Commission to contribute to the solutions presented in the CMP.

**Who reviews construction management plans?**(show below)

CMPs are reviewed by the Department of City Planning, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure and the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections. Once the CMP has been submitted with the Zoning application, Zoning staff will coordinate the review of the CMP with the other departments.

**What is my project does not yet have a general contractor?**(show below)

If a project is required to have a CMP as part of the Zoning Review process, the project architect, engineer or other lead professional can draft the CMP for initial review. It must include the scope of work with details and the mitigation measures, as described above, based on the knowledge and experience of the project professional.

Once a general contractor is brought into the team, modifications and additional details may be added to the CMP during the building permit review phase, provided it is substantially similar to the original CMP approved during the Zoning Review.

**What do I include in the planning commission presentation?**(show below)

Please summarize the following information from the CMP based on the project scope:

- Transportation routing (pedestrians, bicycles and cars)
- Street and sidewalk closures and/or obstructions
- Construction circulation
- Debris/dumpster maintenance
- Work crew parking
- Site maintenance
- Duration of construction
- Other relevant information
- The mitigation efforts

Details do not need to be finalized, but enough information needs to be presented for Planning Commission and the public to understand the impacts.
