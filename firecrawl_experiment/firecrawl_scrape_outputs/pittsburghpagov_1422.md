# Greater Hazelwood Neighborhood Plan

## What’s in the Plan

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/images/6839_cover.jpg) The Greater Hazelwood Neighborhood Plan focuses on ways to strengthen and improve the community while proactively preparing for future growth and change. Greater Hazelwood’s Plan is distinct in its clear objective: Develop without displacement. As the neighborhood continues to evolve, the community will use its Plan to ensure it remains an inclusive, family-friendly neighborhood that recognizes that its' greatest asset is its' people.

The document is organized into five chapters. The Community, Development, Mobility and Infrastructure chapters each identify corresponding priorities, and each priority includes a series of strategies.

### Thanks for coming to the Community Unveiling Event!

More than 130 people joined the Department of City Planning and partners on Monday, September 16, at the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute at Mill 19 to learn about and give feedback on the proposed Greater Hazelwood Neighborhood Plan. We asked participants to identify their top three priorities for each chapter, as well as to join an Action Team. The presentation of the Plan to Planning Commission was only the beginning of the work to be done to implement the plan and make it come alive.
