### Why _must_ I recycle my Electronic Waste?

Due to the passing of the Covered Device Recycling Act (CDRA) in 2010 it banned televisions, computers, and other electronic devices from being placed at the curb and sent to landfill. The Pennsylvania state law was imposed by the Department of Environmental Protection.

### Covered Devices Recycling Act (CDRA)

For more information about CDRA Pa Act 108 or for a more comprehensive list of recyclers, please visit the Department of Environmental Protection’s [CDRA Program Page](https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Land/Waste/SolidWaste/HazardousWaste/Household/Pages/Covered-Device-Recycling-Act.aspx).
