# Website Accessibility

This policy applies to all new, updated, and existing City of Pittsburgh web pages, as well as web content created or updated by the City. It covers content managed by City agencies, departments, offices, and external service providers.

The City of Pittsburgh is committed to ensuring that our website is accessible to everyone, regardless of ability. We do not discriminate against individuals with disabilities in any of our services, programs, or activities.
