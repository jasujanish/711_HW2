# Community Supported Agriculture

Community Supported Agriculture is a partnership between local farmers and supportive members. Farmers receive payment for an entire season up front, and members become shareholders who get a weekly share of harvested produce.

This arrangement benefits both farmers and members â€“ farmers have a guaranteed market and money to pay for labor and supplies at the beginning of the season, and shareholders get fresh food all season while knowing the origin of their how and how it is grown.
