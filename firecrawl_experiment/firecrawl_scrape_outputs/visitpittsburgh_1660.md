# Come One + All: Celebrating Pittsburgh Pride and All Out Music Festival (+ other events to brighten your calendar)

It’s that time of year again when Pittsburgh Pride fills the streets with joy and community during an array of welcoming events spread across town.

This year’s highlights range from Prom and the Kiki Ball May 30 to the march and parade taking place Sunday, June 1, with tons of vendors, performances and festive gatherings sprinkled in between. (Keep an eye on the official website as more details get announced.) Organized by a group of local LGBTQ+ organizations including [TransYOUniting](https://www.transyounitingpgh.org/), [Pittsburgh Pride](https://pittsburghpride.com/) aims to ”stand tall as a beacon of the rust belt’s revival and the joy of honoring those that came before us.”

The weekend also kicks off with Friday’s anticipated Nick Staples Presents All Out Music Festival at Stage AE — a celebration of music, artistry and drag with gates opening at 3 p.m., and the fun continuing until 11 p.m. This year’s lineup includes acts like Galantis, Dragonette, Grant Knoche, Maude LaTour, Hayla, Snow Wife and more. (Lineup times will drop in the next week or two.)

We caught up with All Out organizer Nick Staples to learn what will make this year shine. When asked what he’s been up to since last year's Pride festivities, Staples admits it’s been a whirlwind, in the best way. “After wrapping up last year’s All Out (Formerly Pride on the Shore),” he says, “I dove headfirst into planning — not just for this year’s Pride, but also expanding All Out Music Fest to new cities, including Columbus.” He shares that it’s been nonstop behind-the-scenes — booking artists, refining experiences and making sure this year’s events are even bigger and better.

## So what can Pittsburgh folks expect from this year's extravaganza?

“We’re keeping the heart of All Out Pride the same,” Staples promises. “It's still a space where everyone is welcome, celebrated and can dance their hearts out.”

And when it comes to new additions, they’ve expanded the production and energy. “This year is all about leveling up: bigger stage, brighter lights and more immersive moments between sets,” Staples explains. “We’re also bringing in some surprise elements (think confetti, CO2 blasts) to make those headliner moments unforgettable. Plus, we’re putting a bigger spotlight on local talent and drag royalty, making sure our lineup reflects the full spectrum of this amazing community.”

Staples, for one, feels great excitement about the 2025 lineup. “We’re kicking Pride weekend off with high-energy dance and club vibes — Galantis, Hayla, Dragonette and a Miami drag takeover and so much more,” he says. “I think it gives folks a chance to experience both sides of Pride — the wild celebration and the feel-good unity.”

Galantis is obviously going to bring the heat, Staples reassures, since they never miss when it comes to delivering those euphoric drops. “But I’m also really hyped for Hayla,” he shares. “Her voice paired with those dance beats is going to give people chills.” He believes this lineup will be iconic, and that there’s truly something for everyone.

When it comes to preparing to attend, Staples advises folks to: hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! “And wear whatever makes you feel your absolute best,” he adds, “this is your space to shine.” For first-timers, Staples suggests getting there early to soak in the vibe, check out local performers and stake out a good spot. “And don’t be shy; Pittsburgh’s Pride crowd is one of the friendliest you’ll meet,” he says.

Plan your ride home ahead of time, too, so you can end the night stress-free. And most importantly, Staples says, “Talk to strangers, dance like nobody’s watching, and let yourself be fully in the moment.”
