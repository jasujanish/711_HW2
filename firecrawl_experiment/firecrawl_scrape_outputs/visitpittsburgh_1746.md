# Mt. Washington: More Than a Great View

Ask anyone who has visited Pittsburgh if they have ever been to Mount Washington, and they show you the photos that they took of the iconic Pittsburgh skyline.

Who wouldn't want a glimpse of our top [Must-See Pittsburgh View](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/must-see-pittsburgh-views/)? But, beyond Grandview Avenue, the hilltop neighborhood of [Mount Washington](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/mount-washington/) has so much more to see and do.

## Getting There

It just wouldn't be a trip to Pittsburgh without riding the Inclines! The most exciting route to the top of Mt. Washington is aboard the [Monongahela](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/monongahela-incline/) (we just call it the Mon) and [Duquesne Incline](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/duquesne-incline-public-transportation/), and the view at the top will take your breath away! Find out how to ride the [Inclines](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/how-to-ride-the-pittsburgh-inclines/).

## Get the Full Mount Washington Experience

It can be easy to ride one Incline up, take in the views and head down. However, you'll be missing half the fun on Mount Washington!

Instead, we recommend taking one Incline up and enjoying the 20-minute walk (or a quick Uber/Lyft ride) past observation platforms, gardens, residences and overlooks to the other Incline. This gives the full Mt. Washington experience and let's visitors shop and dine at their leisure while getting the full skyline view.

Next time you're in Pittsburgh, don't miss out on venturing deeper into the Mount, and save plenty of time in your itinerary for exploring Shiloh Street, Emerald View Park and other must-sees along the way.

## EAT

If you work up an appetite while looking down at the skyscrapers, turn around and prepare to treat your taste buds.

### Breakfast

Spending a morning in Mt. Washington means having an awesome start to your day with breakfast! [J&J's Family Restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/jjsfamily/) serves homemade American breakfast classics all day. [Eggs & Moore](http://www.facebook.com/eggsandmoore/), opening soon, is opening soon on the mount with their delectable waffles, sausage gravy and other favorites.

### Lunch

Find a midday break at [Cafe Cravings](https://www.facebook.com/Caf%C3%A9-Cravings-Gourmet-Coffe-Shop-Pittsburgh-328871254124/ "Link to Cafe Cravings Website"), where you can sip gourmet coffees and teas and munch on flavorful and filling paninis. [Gordo's](http://gordospgh.com/) is also a great lunch spot with Mexico City-style street food flavors such as chorizo nachos, brisket quesadilla and scratch-made barbacoa tacos.

### Dinner

There are, of course, plenty of dinner options at the top of the Mount, ranging from low key neighborhood spots to the pinnacle (literally) of fine dining. [Bigham Tavern](http://bighamtavern.com/ "Link to Bigham Tavern website") is a neighborhood spot known for its 30 flavors of wings while Shiloh Gastro is known for having the best mac & cheese in town and can't-miss pierogis.

Fine dining options include the popular [Monterey Bay Fish Grotto](https://montereybayfishgrotto.com/ "Link to Monterey Bay Fish Grotto"), Pittsburgh's premier seafood restaurant, and [LeMont](http://www.lemontpittsburgh.com/ "Link to Lemont Pittsburgh website"), voted the most romantic restaurant in the city by locals in 2022. Four Diamond-rated [Altius](http://altiuspgh.com/about/overview/) is a truly elevated dining experience in more ways than one. Newly opened [OTARU](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/otaru/) brings elevated sushi and sashimi to the Mount accompanied by breathtaking views.

## DRINK

On those hot [summer](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/plan-your-trip/weather/summer-in-pittsburgh/) days, make it a point to take a break on your walk and enjoy a craft beer. [Steel Mill Saloon](http://www.steelmillsaloon.com/) right across from the Duquesne Incline has 30+ plus brews and 10 rotating drafts while [Coughlin's Law Kitchen](http://www.eatatcoughlinslaw.com/) offers 43 rotating taps and a seasonal menu. Enjoy specialty cocktails at [Shiloh Gastro](https://www.shilohgastro.com/drink-menu) and stick around for the best mac & cheese in town.

## SWEET

For dessert, it isn't a visit to Mt. Washington without a scoop from [DiFiore's Ice Cream Delite](http://www.facebook.com/icecreamdelite/)!

[Grandview Bakery](http://www.grandviewbakery.com/ "Link to Grandview Bakery website") is another popular stop for those with a sweet tooth with cupcakes, brownies, cakes, bars and more.

## DO

Mt. Washington is super walkable, and filled with interesting sites and green space.

[Emerald View Park](http://www.pittsburghparks.org/emerald-view-park "Link to Emerald View Park website") connects three historic Pittsburgh parks: Olympia Park, Mount Washington Park and Grandview Park. Each offer lots of hiking opportunities, dog parks, playgrounds and spectacular views. Be sure to stop by the hidden gem that is Jim West's [Point of View sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_View_(sculpture) "Link to Wikipedia page") depicting George Washington and Seneca leader, Guyasuta.

## AND DON'T MISS

And, nearby is another National Historic Landmark. Regarded as a great example of design and function, [Chatham Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Village_(Pittsburgh) "Link to Chatham Village website") is a beautiful little neighborhood worth checking out. The quaint community was built in the 1930s and continues to offer its residents a feeling of tranquility not far from the noise and excitement of downtown Pittsburgh.

Star Wars fans, let the Force guide you to the [Charlie Lewis Parklet](http://goo.gl/maps/PwLuiV5AZo854pVDA). Right outside of the park and beside the fire station, a 20+ year-old vending machine advertising 1999's The Phantom Menace has survived the test of time and become a popular destination for the franchise's fans. Yes, it's still stocked with pop, too!
