## "Highmark Bright Blue Futures Youth Racers" To Encourage Health & Wellness

The Richard S. Caliguiri City of Pittsburgh Great Race presented by Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield is launching a program to encourage children to run a summer community footrace and then receive free registration to The Great Race 5K in the fall.

The "Highmark Bright Blue Futures Youth Racers" program invites children to take part in the 2024 City of Pittsburgh Community Footrace Series by running one of the following 5K races: Greenfield Glide on June 2, Brookline Breeze on August 10, Historic Hill 5K on August 17, and Run Around the Square on August 24. Each youth 6 to 17 years old who completes one of these 5K footrace receives free registration to the September 29 Great Race 5K courtesy of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield.

"The Highmark family of companies is thrilled to be part of the 2024 Pittsburgh Great Race as a long-standing partner of this important cause," said Kenya T. Boswell, senior vice president of community affairs for Highmark Health. "We're excited to launch the Highmark Bright Blue Futures Youth Racers program and can't wait to see the youth who participate committing to their health and wellness."
