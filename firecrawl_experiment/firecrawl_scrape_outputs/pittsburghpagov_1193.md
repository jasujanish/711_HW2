# Litter Index

While we know that litter is a problem for Pittsburgh, quantifying that problem can be very challenging. In order to know if our efforts are improving the amount of litter on the ground, we first need to know just how much litter is on the ground to begin with.

We've recently completed our first test of the pilot program for the Litter Index! Click the page below to see our report on what the Litter Index is, what it found about our streets, and how we are looking to expand in the future!
