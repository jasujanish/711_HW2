# Commitment to Academic Excellence and Community Standards

_February 21, 2025_

Dear Members of the Carnegie Mellon Community:

Yesterday, university leadership was made aware by concerned community members of fliers for an on-campus event advertising an “uncensored discussion” about the former leader of Hamas. This discussion is not approved nor endorsed by the university in any way.

StuCo (Student College), a student organization that facilitates student-led, credit-bearing learning opportunities, originally agreed to sponsor this event as a separate discussion associated with a previously vetted StuCo class. However, this decision extended beyond the scope of StuCo’s purview, especially since the advertised event ultimately did not reflect the thoughtful considerations and scholarly rigor that constitute the very core of our educational offerings. Accordingly, and with the support of Provost Jim Garrett and Vice President and Dean of Students Gina Casalegno, we have informed StuCo’s executive team and the student instructor that this event will not proceed as planned.

Let me be clear: This is not an issue of free speech; it is a matter of academic excellence and community standards. At Carnegie Mellon, our commitment to scholarly discourse allows room for controversial and even uncomfortable discussions to occur. Nonetheless, any event or activity that purports to serve our academic mission must be appropriately vetted, and that simply was not the case in this particular instance.

StuCo has been a cherished CMU tradition for over 20 years — one that provides meaningful learning opportunities for students. I have asked Provost Garrett to further engage StuCo’s executive committee to clarify our expectations and their responsibilities in the context of our academic mission so that this tradition can continue with vibrancy and impact.

I hold no value in higher esteem than our shared commitment to academic excellence. At a time when public trust in higher education is being challenged, it is our responsibility to uphold and champion our mission with unwavering integrity and unmistakable clarity.

Thank you for your continued commitment to the values that make CMU a place of rigorous learning.

Sincerely,

Farnam Jahanian

President

Henry L. Hillman President’s Chair
