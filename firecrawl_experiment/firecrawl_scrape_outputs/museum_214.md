Rhinoceroses are often solitary animals, meaning they only travel with their immediate family. According to recent research by paleontologists, however, their prehistoric North American ancestors—the now-extinct _Teleoceras major_—gathered in “megaherds” of more than 100 rhinos.

The left panel shows a lush garden with figures; the central panel is vibrant with surreal scenes of many nude figures, animals, and oversized fruits; the right panel portrays a darker, chaotic world. The overall tone is mysterious and dreamlike.](https://carnegiemuseums.org/wp-content/uploads/fall25-five-things-garden.jpg)_The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado in Madrid_, c. 1495–1505, attributed to Hieronymus Bosch

Hieronymus Bosch’s 15th-century triptych oil painting _The Garden of Earthly Delights_ is considered a masterpiece of late medieval art. Yet the work was largely unknown until the 20th century, when Salvador Dalí cited Bosch as his predecessor in surrealism.
