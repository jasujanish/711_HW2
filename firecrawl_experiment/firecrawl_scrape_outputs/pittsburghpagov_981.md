# Planning Process

## History

The Broadway Avenue Public Realm (BAPR) project was derived from the SMART TRID Study completed in May 2011, which covered the neighborhoods of Allentown, Beechview, Beltzhoover, and Mount Washington (SMART = South Metro Area Revitalization through Transit / TRID = Transit Revitalization Investment District). This work built on the prior TRID Study in Dormont.

The purpose of the SMART TRID Study was to examine the existing conditions and future opportunities located roughly within a ½-mile of South Hills Junction and the Red Line stops in Beechview with the goals of increasing transit ridership, spurring economic development, strengthening existing neighborhood assets, enhancing the public realm, improving safety, and encouraging community-building around transit.

The main goals of this work were to:

- Attract investment and redevelopment along the Red Line through transit and streetscape enhancements.
- Make it easy for people to choose another mode of transportation one way to alleviate congestion.
- Enhance all T stations to be community assets.

## Key Goals for Broadway Avenue

- Slow traffic
- Improve safety
- Improve the T-Stations
- Manage stormwater
- Encourage safe walking and biking
- Promote a main street character
