## Film Permitting

Welcome to Eproval Pittsburgh!

The City of Pittsburgh Office of Film & Event Management is the managing office for all commercial film projects within the City of Pittsburgh. Please allow ample time for application review, especially if significant City resources are required for your shoot to be successful.

Applications must be received at least seven (7) business days before your first shoot date.

Location managers and film producers can apply for the following permits through Eproval:

- Permits for the parking of production trucks for shoots on private property;
- Permits for commercial still photography shoots on public property;
- Permits for the use of drones for commercial filming purposes;
- Permits for any shoots that close public property and require the coordination of City services.

To begin your application process, please use the following link to launch Eproval. Please be sure to read the information provided on the “Getting Started: Film Permits” document regarding application deadlines and application fees. Call 412-255-2641 or email [ofem@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:ofem@pittsburghpa.gov) with any questions.
