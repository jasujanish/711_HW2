## Where do the Pirates play their home games?

PNC Park is the celebrated baseball stadium, situated in the [North Shore](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/family-time-north-shore-northside/) neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that proudly serves as the home of the Pirates.

## How to get to PNC Park

**Public Transportation**

Since parking on the North Shore near the stadium is limited, it's often easier to park and ride to the stadium using other options. [Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT)](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/pittsburgh-regional-transit/) offers light rail service on the T and city buses for fans coming from Downtown Pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. You can find more information on how to get to the stadium on the PRT website.

**Riverboat Shuttles**

The [Gateway Clipper](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/gateway-clipper-fleet-boat-chartering-water-taxi/) also offers gameday riverboat rides to the stadium and is my personal favorite way to get to the game. Park at Station Square, grab your tickets and enjoy your ride around the Point with raucous, fun-loving fans before getting dropped off right at the stadium. Find more information about [riverboat shuttles here](http://www.gatewayclipper.com/shuttle-service/).

**Driving & Parking Information**

If you are planning to drive and park near the stadium, visit [ALCO parking](http://alcoparking.com/acrisure-stadium-pnc-park/) for a helpful interactive guide to parking on the North Shore.

## Where to eat near PNC Park

The North Shore, home to PNC Park, is filled with plenty of bars and restaurants for all baseball fans.

[Shorty's Pins & Pints](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/shortys-pins-x-pints/), [Southern Tier](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/southern-tier-brewery/), [Tom's Watch Bar](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/toms-watch-bar/), [Burgatory](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/burgatory-north-shore/), [Bar Louie](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/bar-louie-north-shore/), and [Mike's Beer Bar](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/mikes-beer-bar/) are popular spots to grab a craft beer pre- or post-game that are walkable to PNC Park. Even if you don't have a ticket, these locales are some of the best places to watch the game outside of PNC Park, promising a lively atmosphere and passionate fans cheering on every play to go with your food and drink.

If you're looking to eat inside of the stadium, [here are the food highlights](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/what-to-eat-at-pnc-park/) you can expect to find (spoiler, they're all _mouthwatering_).

## What else to do near PNC Park

There's so much to do in the North Shore we did a [whole blog](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pre-concert-north-shore/) about everything to explore pre- or post-game, from stadium tours and museum visits to kayaking, duckpin bowling and shopping for the latest Pirates merch.

## More cool things to do near PNC Park
