# Annual Douse-A-Dean Fundraiser

In partnership with the University Police, Douse-A-Dean is a friendly competition between the deans (and the provost) to see who can raise the most money in support of Special Olympics PA by sitting under a bucket of water while participants try to release that bucket by throwing balls at a target.
