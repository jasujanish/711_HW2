# Adopting Restructuring Recommendations of PWSA Blue Ribbon Panel

Published on January 22, 2018

PITTSBURGH, PA (January 22, 2018) Mayor William Peduto today issued an Executive Order adopting recommendations of his Blue Ribbon Panel on restructuring Pittsburgh Water & Sewer Authority governance.

After a year of study, the panel last month issued recommendations that the PWSA remain a public asset while having its board of directors named by an independent Board of Nominators, insulating it from political influence. The Mayor's Executive Order adopts that recommendation and empowers the panel to hire legal counsel to prepare a contract between the City and the PWSA regarding the panel's recommendations.

The Order calls for the contract to be adopted by March 31 of this year.

"\[Because\] the Mayor understands that it is important to make long-overdue changes in the way The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is governed and invest in our water and sewer infrastructure, he appointed the Blue Ribbon Panel in March of 2017 to advise the City on the selection of a consultant to provide an independent review of the current state of PWSA and recommendations for improvement," the Order reads in part.

"\[While\] the Blue Ribbon Panel report stated that PWSA has made significant progress in recent months, PWSA, working with its new Board of Directors, must continue to pursue aggressively its transformation into a high-functioning, customer-oriented organization and its plan to repair and replace the existing water supply infrastructure."
