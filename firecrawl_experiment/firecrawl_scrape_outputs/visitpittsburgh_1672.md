# Paw-sitively Perfect Pittsburgh Adventures

Exploring the city’s dog-friendly spaces, from inviting hotels and cafe patios to a brand-new dog bar in The Strip

For many, adventures don’t feel complete without your canine family member(s) by your side. Thankfully, Pittsburgh offers a bounty of green spaces and trails on which to explore within — and beyond — city limits, as well as dog parks where social furballs can romp with new friends.

Though it’s a bit tougher to tote along your four-legged friend before the weather warms up, there are several spaces ready to host your whole crew indoors. For example, we love browsing the goods together at Regent Square’s [3 Rivers Outdoor Co.](https://3riversoutdoor.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqX8Lpol5L2YzY3JKE7BCfi7jMAovyMMJylqU3spkrDtudPbTxz) (and grabbing a very generous pup cup from nearby [Spigolo](https://spigolopgh.com/) afterward), or heading to Bloomfield’s welcoming [Trace Brewing](https://www.tracebloomfield.com/) for an inside coffee or pint.

Once patio season officially recommences, here’s a list of some of the city’s [dog-friendly restaurants and bars](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/dog-friendly-restaurants-and-bars-in-pittsburgh/). (We recommend calling these [properties](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/beer/city/pittsburgh_pa_us/) in advance or checking updated websites to confirm.) And in the meantime, here are a few businesses going above and beyond to cater to your whole crew.

### A Gathering Space for Canines + Human Friends

* * *

In late October, Alissa May and husband Travis opened [The Dog Penn](https://thedogpenn.com/), a 21-and-over establishment in The Strip they describe as a private dog park-meets-full-service bar. So far, the response has been “pretty great,” and they already have a solid base of regulars. Because it’s membership based, a lot of the same people and dogs cycle through. “The dogs get to know each other as do the people,” May says. “We've had some people exchange info so their dogs can play together again. It’s really awesome to see. We joke that we are the backyard of The Strip. With drinks.” She adds, “You do not need a dog to come in! We are also just a regular bar to hang at, and get some puppy skritches!”

A native of Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, Alissa met Travis while living in Seattle (where he’s from). “From there we spent a few years travelling the world, including a six-year rotation of Alaska in the summers and Thailand in the winters,” she explains. “Grounded by the pandemic in 2020, we did what a lot of people did and got a dog! We decided to put our roots down closer to my family, and thought Pittsburgh was the perfect place.”

They packed up their “mini winnie” and started the long drive from Alaska to Pennsylvania. During a stop in Seattle, they found several dog park and bar concepts similar to what they’ve now created. “We all thought they were just the best thing ever! As we drove, we sought them out. We were excited to join one when we got to Pittsburgh, but found it wasn't a thing here yet.” Since they’ve been longtime bartenders and industry workers, the couple always considered opening a bar. But when they added the dog concept, it became a true passion.

“I was hesitant about just opening a bar because, meh, a dime a dozen,” Alyssa admits. “Plus we know the industry so well, we weren't prepared to make it our whole world. But combined with the dog concept, it opened up so much more. So many cute things we could do, so many fundraising events, so many ways to help. We knew there was a market, we could see it and we were a part of it.”

Plus, nothing like it existed in Pittsburgh. The couple lives in the South Side and barely have a backyard. They were at the dog park every day and quickly learned it was a great way to meet people. “Dog parks have always been a social place for us,” she says. “There are no dog parks in The Strip where we are. So many new condos and apartments that are dog-friendly. We fill a big need in the area.”

To enter with a dog, guests must download the bar’s app, create a profile for their dog, upload up-to-date vaccinations (rabies, DHPP, bordetella and lepto) and purchase a pass. A day pass costs $12, a monthly pass $40 and an annual one $300. This all can be done before arrival (and is encouraged!). “The app then generates a QR that they boop to enter,” she says.

The Dog Penn has a full bar and they serve popcorn, hot dogs and charcuterie boxes. As it warms up, the venue will begin carrying sandwiches and pastries from neighboring [Pane E Pronto](https://paneepronto.com/), and they’ll get food trucks on rotation too. For now, visitors can bring in any food they like. They host trivia on Wednesdays, and have already had events from Howl at the Movies to a live Puppy Bowl with adoptable puppies (with proceeds from each event benefiting local rescues). In the summer they plan to do morning yoga (puppy and goat!), foam parties, dog prom and more.

“We hope to create a space for dog owners and lovers to congregate and share what brings us all joy — dogs!” Alyssa says. The couple adores their own pet, Sabre, who was the inspiration for this entire creation. “There are portraits of pups painted all along the side of our building,” she says. “\[Sabre’s\] is the largest, naturally.”

## Pup-Friendly Digs Beckoning for a Downtown Staycation

The Kimpton brand has long been lauded for its hospitality toward four-legged friends, and the Hotel [Monaco Pittsburgh](https://www.monaco-pittsburgh.com/) is no exception. Marketing and Communications Manager Madison Kelkis agrees that Kimpton stands out as a pet lover’s paradise, offering an array of thoughtful dog-centric amenities that appeal to travelers with pets. “The hotel’s welcoming policy allows pets of any size, breed or weight to stay free of charge,” she shares, “with no limit on the number of pets per room—perfect for those who want to travel with their furry companions.”

Kelkis expands that, upon arrival, pets are treated like VIPs — receiving water bowls, custom dog treats and courtesy bags for walks, along with the option of pet beds being sent up upon request. Dogs can even attend the hosted wine hour with you. Plus, the hotel has partnered with premier pet care service Wag!, offering guests access to Wag! Premium, which includes 10% off all services, waived booking fees and even 24/7 vet chat.

Kelkis and team value letting guests bring furry friends along since they recognize how integral pets are to people’s lives. “For many travelers, their pets are more than just animals,” she says, “they're family members. By welcoming pets, we provide a sense of comfort and peace of mind for our guests, allowing them to fully enjoy their stay without the worry of leaving their pets behind.”

The hotel’s location proves ideal for pet owners, too, placing guests just steps away from Mellon Square Park, and also close to some of the city’s pet-friendly cafes, restaurants and green spaces.

“For guests without dogs,” Kelkis adds, “the hotel’s prime location offers a convenient base for exploring Pittsburgh’s vibrant cultural scene, local attractions and dining options.” Within a few blocks, guests might venture out on their own to savor breakfast at [The Speckled Egg](https://thespeckledeggpgh.com/) in the historic [Union Trust Building](https://uniontrustbuilding.com/) or dinner and cocktails at happening [The Ritual House](https://www.ritualhousepgh.com/). Or, you can stick close to “home” and dive into delicious fare served just downstairs from your room at [The Commoner](https://thecommonerpgh.com/).

Monaco staff wants all guests to feel cared for and valued, whether human or four-legged, and the pet-friendly approach only adds to the warm, welcoming atmosphere for everyone. “It’s just one of the many ways we show that we’re not just a hotel,” Kelkis says, “we’re a place where guests and their pets can truly feel at home.”

About three miles away, [The Oaklander Hotel](https://theoaklanderhotel.com/) proves a luxurious hotel homebase within walking distance of Oakland highlights like University of Pittsburgh’s towering Cathedral of Learning and nearby Phipps Conservatory — an uplifting gem in any season. This Marriott Autograph Collection Hotel warmly welcomes furry friends, too, who may just enjoy the soothing room vibes and inspiring views as much as you.

“The hotel is walking distance to some great areas and parks to walk your dogs including Schenley Park, the CMU campus and the Pitt campus,” says Director of Sales and Marketing Kelly Giger. Enjoy a picnic lounging on some of the surrounding green, or leave your pup snoozing in the room while you savor a quick bite at [The Cafe Carnegie](https://thecafecarnegie.com/) (inside the art museum) or [The Porch at Schenley](https://www.dineattheporch.com/).

Or humans may simply choose to cozy up in their ulta-comfortable room for much of the stay— and order room service — so as to not waste any time in their soothing haven marked by Turkish cotton bedding, bath linens and robes, plus a walk-in shower with rainfall showerhead and Le Labo “Santal 33” luxury bath amenities.

Dogs up to 50 pounds (max of two per room) are very welcome here too — with pet fees of $20/night and cleaning fees of $50/stay. Standout amenities include the VIP (Very Important Pooch) Package with perks like homemade dog treats, a Kong tennis ball, roll of waste bags and a room that comes equipped with a dog bed and food/water bowls.

“Pets are an important extension of people's families and for some travelers,” Giger says, adding, “they are emotional support. Guests want to know that their pets will be welcomed just like we would welcome a person to the hotel, and be well taken care of.”

No matter where you take your pup in this town, we guarantee they’ll simply be grateful to come along for the ride.
