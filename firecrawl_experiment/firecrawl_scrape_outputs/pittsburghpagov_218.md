### 7/12/22 Proposed Programmatic Agreement Regarding Section 106 Review of HUD-assisted Projects in the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

The City of Pittsburgh, acting in its capacity as Responsible Entity, is working with the Region 3 Office of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), to develop a Programmatic Agreement (PA) that will apply to Section 106 review of projects in the City that are subject to Part 58 and Part 50 of HUD’s environmental regulations (24 CFR Part 58 and 24CFR Part 50).

The PA will cover the review of HUD-assisted projects, including Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investments Partnerships (HOME), Emergency Shelter Grant Program (ESG), and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA). Improving the efficiency of Section 106 review of HUD projects is the purpose of the PA while fostering the protection of historic properties that might be impacted by proposed projects.

As the Responsible Entity for Part 58 reviews, we would like to invite interested parties and the public to provide feedback and participate in the development of this PA, as part the Section 106 consultation process.

A draft of the PA is attached to this email and also located at the following web link:

[Proposed Programmatic Agreement Regarding Section 106 Review of HUD-assisted Projects in the City of Pittsburgh(PDF, 586KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/omb/documents/public-participation/18638_draft_hud_statewide_pa_for_pennsylvania_city_of_pittsburgh_historic_review.pdf)

Please provide comments by Thursday, July 28 at 4:00 PM to [whitney.finnstrom@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:whitney.finnstrom@pittsburghpa.gov).

The PA will cover projects such as community and economic development, interior housing rehabilitation, etc. The PA exempts from Section 106 review a list of types of activities that do not cause effects to historic resources, like refinancing of existing buildings without any rehabilitation, replacement of heating systems, bathroom and kitchen remodeling, and repair of roofs and windows. Projects that include activities other than those types of exempted activities, like substantial rehabilitation and new construction, will still undergo a complete Section 106 review, including consultation with SHPO, tribes and other consulting parties.

The streamlined process outlined in the PA will apply to HUD offices and Responsible Entities (units of state and general local government and tribes) such as the City of Pittsburgh that conduct Section 106 review of HUD projects and that have signed the PA as Signatory Parties.

More information on the [Section 106 review process](https://www.hudexchange.info/environmental-review/historic-preservation/) is available.

### 11/30/2020 CARES Act (CDBG-CV) Funding and FY 2019 Annual Action Plan - Substantial Amendment

As an entitlement community, the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (“City”) receives funding from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG), HOME (HOME) Investment Partnerships Program, Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA), and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) Program. Through the March 27, 2020 passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Public Law 116-136, the City has also received CDBG-CV, ESG-CV, and HOPWA-CV allocations. The City will receive an additional round of Community Development Block Grant Coronavirus (CDBG-CV) funds in the amount of $3,112,342.

The purpose of this public hearing is to present substantial amendments to the City of Pittsburgh’s FY 2019 Annual Action Plan for the use of the FY 2020 CDBG-CV # 3 funds.

To expedite the disbursement of the City’s 2020 CDBG-CV # 3 funds, via 24 CFR 5.110, the CARES Act authorizes HUD to grant waivers to the public notice, public comment, and citizen participation plan requirements found in 24 CFR 91.105I(2) and (k), 24 CFR 91.115I(2) and (i) and 24 CFR 91.401. In accordance with the City of Pittsburgh’s Citizen Participation Plan and HUD’s regulatory requirement waivers (which reduce the minimum 30-day public comment period to a 5-day period), a virtual public hearing will be held at 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday, December 1, 2020 to provide an opportunity for comment on proposed Substantial Amendments to its 2019 Annual Action Plan. The public hearing virtual location will be posted on this page. Please check the [Community Development page](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/City-Government/Finance-Budget/Management-Budget/Community-Development) for more information.

The funds allocated under the CARES Act may be used for a range of eligible activities that prevent and respond to the spread of infectious diseases such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The proposed activities must meet one of the three National Objectives as required by CDBG regulation:

- Benefit low-and moderate-income persons
- Aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight, and
- Meet an urgent need

In addition, and for the purpose of an expedited use of the CDBG-CV funding, the bill eliminates the cap on the amount of funds a grantee can spend on public services, removes the requirement to hold in-person public hearings in order to comply with national and local social gather requirements, and allows grantees to be reimbursed for COVID-19 response activities regardless of the date the costs were incurred. The bill also allows grantees to apply the waiver of statutory regulations to 2019 and 2020 allocations.

The City of Pittsburgh previously adopted its FY 2019 Annual Action Plan and Budgets for the use of CDBG funds. In accordance with CDBG program regulations, the City of Pittsburgh is allowed to make substantial amendments to its Annual Action Plan and Budgets in accordance with the City’s Citizen Participation Plan.

The City has determined that it is necessary to amend the approved CDBG program budget for the previously approved program year for FY 2019. The funds will be reprogrammed from cancelled projects/activities to new projects/activities and/or increase funding for other previously approved projects/activities.

These are considered substantial amendments in accordance with the City’s Citizen Participation Plan as the following applies: the scope, purpose, and location of the project activity have changed.

The amendment to the FY 2019 Annual Action Plan is proposed as follows:

CDBG-CV # 3 Activities:

- Emergency Rental Assistance$2,000,000
- Bryn Mawr (East Hills) - HVAC System$ 250,000
- Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank$ 281,171
- Jewish Family and Children Services - Food Bank$ 281,171
