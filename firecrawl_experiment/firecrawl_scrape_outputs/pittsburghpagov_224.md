Awarded projects provide direct services to Pittsburgh residents with low to moderate incomes. PSG has funded projects such as food pantries, youth programs, job training, career counseling, literacy programs, senior activity programs, and more.

PSG applications are accepted once per calendar year. Funding allocations are determined by the Office of the Mayor, but priorities are determined with public input through our [Public Hearing](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/City-Government/Finance-Budget/Management-Budget/Community-Development/Public-Participation) process.
