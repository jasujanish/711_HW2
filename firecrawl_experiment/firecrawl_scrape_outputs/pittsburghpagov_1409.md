The South Side Park Master Plan is an outcome of the City’s comprehensive Open Space Plan (2013) which identified South Side Park as a potential Signature Community Park in need of a master plan that includes neighboring Arlington Park and harnesses the City’s energy for creating an inclusive space that offers recreation, programming, connectivity and ecologic systems within its urban context. The site is inherently dramatic, providing both opportunities and challenges for public space-making. Design decisions will take cues from the unique culture and spaces within South Side Park’s energetic community and rich landscape, which engages the site’s natural systems while also providing a strategic plan for providing phased community resources. The outcome to generate a master plan that presents a strategy for implementation and suggested phasing for individual projects that may be easily adopted into future city budgets and by various other funding sources. Projects will be achievable and representative pieces of the larger vision of a unified framework that both builds community pride and helps to guide future capital investments.
