# Car Seat Safety

As part of our Public Safety Education commitment, the Pittsburgh EMS Training Division is a permanent Child Passenger Safety Seat Fitting Station. Certain members of the Community Outreach and Public Education (COPE) Team have completed a rigorous training program designed to make them experts at Child Seat Safety. Pittsburgh EMS believes that every child deserves to be safe and these team members have made it a point to start our next generation off right by ensuring their safety from day one. By working with PA TECHS our Car Seat Safety team is able to provide expert knowledge and installation of Child Safety Seats on a regular basis.

Any City resident needing assistance with installing a child safety seat in a vehicle should request an in person or virtual appointment by filling out our [Child Safety Seat Installation Request Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=F3n09QTJaEORINMnzxdVkVAi2LBfjHJOiFoOZlHn8uBURU1ZSEtIOU0zNDFCTVdLNDJRVUhJWjVaTC4u).
