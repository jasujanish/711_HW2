**Pittsburgh, PA –** CitiParks will host their annual TRACK & TREAT Event at the Bud Harris Cycling Track (1401 Washington Blvd.) in Highland Park on Saturday, October 19, 2024 from Noon to 4 p.m.

“One of our favorite family days at CitiParks, Track & Treat is cycling fun for the whole family,” noted Director Kathryn Vargas.  “It is also a great opportunity to visit Bud Harris Cycling Track—a unique venue where kids can pedal their hearts out with lots of fun along the way!”

Join CitiParks for this FREE healthy lifestyle event that’s fun for the entire family with a Halloween theme!  Children and families are welcome to wear their Halloween costumes; bring their own bikes or borrow one of ours!  Cycle around the Bud Harris Cycling Track; stopping along the way to learn bike etiquette & safety and have fun decorating their bikes.  Children can enjoy Halloween and seasonal games, crafts, balloons, face painting and more along the Track with music, refreshments and life-sized, hand-painted seasonal decor!

_The Bud Harris Cycling Track is a half-mile oval loop along Washington Boulevard.  It is a one-of-a-kind attraction, drawing elite cyclists and beginners to its banked corners and slight hill.  Formerly a drivers’ training course, the facility accommodates track and criterium racing and time trials, as well as this annual CitiParks Halloween Event._
