# Clean Pittsburgh Commission

![Clean Pittsburgh Commission Logo](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/images/8381_clean-pittsburgh-commission-logo-update.jpg)

The Clean Pittsburgh Commission (CPC) was established in August 2005 through legislation introduced to City Council by then Councilman Doug Shields and co-sponsored by then Council members Dan Deasy, Bill Peduto and Luke Ravenstahl. The CPC’s mission is: to work to improve the environmental quality of life of Pittsburgh residents through litter, illegal dumping and recycling initiatives.

The CPC is comprised of representatives from various City departments, local non-profits, individuals and community groups. The activities of the CPC are focused in three primary areas:

1. Monitoring/awareness/prevention
2. Clean-up
3. Enforcement

The primary function of the CPC is to provide oversight, direction, leadership, resources and assistance to community groups and individuals while serving as the liaison between these groups and the appropriate City departments.

## Upcoming Meetings

The Clean Pittsburgh Commission has traditionally met on the 2nd Thursday of each month, with varying times and locations to give more opportunities for more people to participate, as all meetings were open to the public. During the pandemic, we have moved online to Zoom, and have had our meetings live streamed **every 2nd Thursday of the Month at 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM** and with all recordings posted to the City of Pittsburgh's YouTube channel [CityChannel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CityChannelPittsburgh).

As long as we continue this format, we our ability to open up the meeting to everyone is unfortunately curtailed. We encourage everybody to watch our meeting videos and reach out to us with any questions or concerns to bring up in meeting, and we look forward to post-pandemic when we can meet together with the open public once again!

To view a live stream while the meeting is happening, visit either the [Clean Pittsburgh Commission's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/cleanpghcommission) or [CityChannel YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/c/CityChannelPittsburgh) at the 10:00 time each month.
