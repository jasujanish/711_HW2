# Pickles, Pacers, and a Grand Prix: Your 2025 Picklesburgh Weekend Itinerary

Coming to Pittsburgh for Picklesburgh? See what else our city of multitudes has to offer for the weekend!

[Picklesburgh](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pittsburgh-is-picklesburgh/) is a big dill, but it's not the only thing happening in Pittsburgh from July 11-13. Here's what else is going on throughout the city that weekend!

## Friday

[America's Mile](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/events-festivals/annual-events/americas-mile/), a spectacular race event open to all, kicks off on July 11. The race is set against Pittsburgh's breathtaking North Shore. Choose your challenge from diverse heats like the inclusive MOVE Mile, the brave Heroes' Mile, and the competitive Aspire Mile (just to name a few of your options!), catering to every age and ability.

[Registration](https://americasmile.com/) is open throughout the morning of the race, and it's a great opportunity to take in some gorgeous views of the city. After the race, head over to [Mike's Beer Bar](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/mikes-beer-bar/) for the official afterparty!

## Saturday

Picklesburgh is back and is bigger and brinier than ever. The annual festival is taking over two of Pittsburgh's Sister Bridges for a weekend of pickle parties. Deemed the #1 specialty food festival in the country in USA Today's 10Best contest, you'll find yourself fully immersed in a culinary fever dream in the best way imaginable.

If you get pickled out, or you're not a fan of pickles in the first place, there's plenty to check out around the city and away from the crowd. Take your pick at plenty of food options that aren't pickle-themed around the city; if you're looking to make the most of your trip, I recommend stopping at either [Waffles INCaffeinated](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/waffles-incaffeinated-downtown-1392555-disabled/) or [The Speckled Egg](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/the-speckled-egg/) to get yourself fed and ready for the day. If you want to take in a view of the skyline without people getting into your photo ops, head over to the Riverwalk along the [North Shore](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/north-shore-memorials/) or the [inclines](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/how-to-ride-the-pittsburgh-inclines/) and [Mount Washington](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/mt-washington-more-than-a-great-view/) to take in the sunshine and cityscape.

## Sunday

The [Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/pittsburgh-vintage-grand-prix/) (PVGP), celebrating its 43rd anniversary in 2025, is the nation's [largest vintage street race](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pittsburgh-vintage-grand-prix/) and the only one staged on public roads. The 10-day event kicks off on July 11 and is the perfect way to cap off your weekend in Pittsburgh.

The weekend festivities are happening at Pittsburgh International Race Complex in Wampum, just 40 minutes north of the city. But before you head out there, or when you're passing Pittsburgh on your way home, we recommend taking a walk around [Oakland](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/oakland-neighborhood-guide/), where the Grand Prix will hold its main event the following weekend. Take in the [Nationality Rooms](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/nationality-and-heritage-rooms/) in the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning, stop for brunch at [The Porch at Schenley](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/the-porch-at-schenley/), and hop over to the beautiful [Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/soldiers-sailors-memorial-hall-museum/).
