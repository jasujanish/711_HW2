## Pittsburgh Police Cares

### What is Pittsburgh Police Cares?

Pittsburgh Police Cares is an online resource to help community members connect directly with Pittsburgh Police officers who work in their neighborhoods.

By visiting the Pittsburgh Police Cares link for your police zone, you can find upcoming community events and alerts, monthly and annual crime statistics, and the names and email addresses for the officers in each sector of the zone so you can ask for them by name.

This allows residents and community members to connect with officers on a first name basis to request a police presence for events, report crimes or disturbances, and ultimately create stronger community/police partnerships built on familiarity and mutual trust.
