The Office of the Board of Trustees and Secretary of the Corporation provide strategic leadership and serve as primary liaison to the Board of Trustees, the administration and the university community, which enables the board to perform its fiduciary duty at a high level, the administration to operate efficiently and effectively with respect to the governance of the university, and the university community to understand and engage with the governing board. The office also oversees the management and operations of the trustees and its committees, including the presidential advisory boards that conduct reviews of the universityâ€™s programs.
