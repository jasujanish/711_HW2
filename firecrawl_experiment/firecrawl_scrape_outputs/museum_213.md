Powdermill Nature Reserve welcomed Mary Janecka as its new director this summer. A field scientist at heart, Janecka was most recently assistant professor of evolutionary biology and curator of ichthyology and parasitology at the University of Texas at El Paso. Earlier in her career, she was a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh, where she was first introduced to Powdermill. “With her multidisciplinary expertise, Mary is uniquely positioned to further elevate Powdermill’s scientific profile and impact,” said Gretchen Baker, the Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Director of Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

### Teens At Work

There was a youth invasion at the four Carnegie Museums this summer, as 25 Pittsburgh teens spent six weeks learning about the work that goes on at the museums as part of the Learn & Earn and Teen CEO career-readiness programs. The teens were paid for their time through the programs as they assisted with museum-related tasks from June 30 to August 7, developing hard and soft skills as they also completed a final group project. The Learn & Earn and Teen CEO programs—partnerships supported by Allegheny County, the City of Pittsburgh, and workforce development nonprofit Partner4Work—have connected nearly 13,500 young people with jobs at more than 400 worksites across Allegheny County since they began in 2015.
