## 1\. Overview

One of the Department of City Planning’s core responsibilities include recommending policies and developing long-range plans that adapt and evolve the City’s approach to land use to meet current and future housing needs.

## 2\. Inclusionary Housing

Inclusionary Housing is a zoning tool used to increase the production of affordable housing and provide a diverse range of housing choices. Currently, the City of Pittsburgh has four Inclusionary Housing Overlay Districts (IZ-O), where developments of 20 or more units are required to provide at least 10% of all units as affordable. Residents looking to rent or own affordable units within the IZ-O can find helpful documents and links to resources in the Renters and Homeowners tab, respectively. Developers that wish to build within the IZ-O can access guides to providing affordable units within the Developers tab.

**Renters**(show below)

There are four neighborhoods in the City of Pittsburgh that require developers to provide 10% of total units at an affordable rent for households earning up to 50% Area Median Income (AMI):

**Bloomfield**

**New Zoning in Oakland**

In response to the need for growth in housing and jobs, the Oakland Plan (official neighborhood plan adopted in 2022) established a [Land Use Strategy](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/oakland/strategy-land-use-strategy "https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/oakland/strategy-land-use-strategy") that mapped future development patterns based on the community's vision and goals. The plan's guidance established three new zoning districts, which include innovative provisions for mixed-use development, flexible building heights, design and sustainability standards, affordable housing, and equitable workforce development.

The first package of zoning amendments included the Fifth & Forbes corridor, Boulevard of the Allies, and Central Oakland between Louisa Street and Dawson Street, which was adopted in February of 2023.

The second package of zoning amendments included large portions of North Oakland, which was adopted in February of 2025.

**Comprehensive Plan**

Housing is a very emotional topic because it is many things for most people: it is a place to rest, a private space, a place for kids to grow or for people to age in place; housing is a nest egg and a space to create memories, art, families, connections, and communities. But the language of planning will often focus on measurable criteria such as the number of housing units, or percentage of renters versus homeowners. The City of Pittsburgh and Department of City Planning’s [Comprehensive Plan process](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/City-Planning/Neighborhood-Planning/Comprehensive-Planning-Process) is designed to go beyond the usual numbers and connect with Pittsburghers to capture a shared vision for 2050. It is also designed to guide the development of land use policies and goals that could help meet the needs of our fellow residents for safe, affordable, and healthy homes and communities.
