# Health and Safety

## See something. Say something.

The well-being of every individual in the Carnegie Mellon University family is a top priority for the university. CMU offers a variety of health and safety services — from departments such as University Health Services to Environmental Health & Safety to a dedicated University Police unit.

The mission of CMUSafe is to empower the CMU community to say something if we see something.
