# Yard Debris

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dpw/images/yard_debris.png)

The City of Pittsburgh offers special curbside collection days twice a year to promote environmentally-friendly disposal of your seasonal yard debris, as well as year round drop off.

Saturday, April 26th is our Spring Yard Waste Curbside collection event. Scroll down for a full list of what is accepted and not allowed. If you miss this event we have three locations where you can drop off yard waste for free.

Please check the [collection schedule](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Resident-Services/Trash-Recycling/Collection-Schedule-and-Newsletter) or visit [PGH.ST](https://pgh.st/) to see what day your curbside pickup falls on

**We will collect the following items curbside:**

- Leaves
- Branches (4" diameter or less)
- Brush
- Grass

## Set-Out

- Items must be in paper bags weighing less than 35 pounds. **No plastic bags, please!**
- Bundle all branches with fiber twine or natural rope in lengths of 5 feet or less
- Set these items out at the curb at your regular collection spot before 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the collection day.

_Yard waste that does not meet the collection guidelines will be left at the curb._

## Drop-Off Locations

City residents may also bring their yard waste to one of our participating drop-off centers, year-round. _No drop-offs by commercial haulers are accepted._ The fee structure varies by vehicle type:

- Cars and SUVs (without trailers): **Free**
- Pick-ups, vans and any pull-behind trailers: **$22.00**
- Dump trucks and large box vans: **$54.00**
  - _Requires prior approval from the DPW Director._

Payment Method:

- No cash is accepted at drop-off locations.
- Payments must be made by check or money order only.
  - Checks are to be made out to _Treasurer, City of Pittsburgh_ **.**

These locations also accept tires. Only two (2) tires are allowed per day, per resident, for drop off and must have rims removed beforehand.

Drop-off centers are open Monday-Friday and may offer Saturday hours. Call each center for details and hours.
