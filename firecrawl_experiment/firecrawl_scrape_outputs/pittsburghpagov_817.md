# Mechanical/HVAC Trade License

The City of Pittsburgh requires an HVAC Contractor License to install, erect, enlarge, repair, alter, remove, convert, or replace any mechanical system within the City of Pittsburgh.

Trade licenses are issued for the purposes of verifying an individual's qualifications for performing trade work. Trade licenses are issued to individuals, not companies. In order to obtain permits, trade license holders must further provide a tax compliance letter from the City Finance Department, a certificate of general liability insurance, and evidence of worker's comp insurance or an affidavit of exemption, as outlined in our Rules and Regulations.
