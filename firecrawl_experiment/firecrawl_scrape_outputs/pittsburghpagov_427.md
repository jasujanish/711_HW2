# Shade Tree Commission

The Shade Tree Commission is a quasi-governmental entity created by Pittsburgh ordinance [Title Four, Article XIII, Chapter 487](https://ecode360.com/45447093). Comprised of Mayor-appointed and City Council-approved volunteers, the Commission is funded through the Outdoor Advertising Excise Tax and funds from developers unable to meet street tree requirements (Alternative Compliance funds

The Shade Tree Commission approves recommendations to the Mayor’s office and City Council to expend funds from the Shade Tree Trust Fund to advance urban forestry initiatives.

In recognition of the value of Pittsburgh's urban trees as one of our city's greatest assets, Commissioners are tasked with making recommendations to City Government to restore and maintain the city's tree population. The Commission is dedicated to providing policy makers, City Departments, and the general public with accurate and objective information on policy issues affecting the urban forest.
