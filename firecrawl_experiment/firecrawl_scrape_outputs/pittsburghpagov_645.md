**Work Sharing & HUD**(show below)

Work-sharing is the word for how we work with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as a "substantially equivalent" entity. We investigate cases in their stead and they help support us in doing so with grants and an ongoing contract.

![If you were robbed, you'd report it...But most victims of housing discrimination don't. Why? Because today housing discrimination is subtle and sophisticated, which makes it harder to detect. Know your housing rights. According to the federal Fair Housing Act, it's illegal to consider race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or familial status in rental, sales, lending or homeowner's insurance decisions. Don't let them rob you of your civil rights. Fair housing is the Law! The only way to stop discrimination is to fight it. ](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/images/chr-resources/if_you_were_robbed_you-d_report_it_002.jpg?w=1622&h=1976)

**Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing**(show below)

One part of what we do with HUD when we use its funds, particularly those from the city's Community Development Block Grant, is a mandate called "affirmatively furthering fair housing." In 2020, Pittsburgh's AFFH (Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing) Task Force released a final report after years of working on recommendations on how the City can engage in affirmatively furthering fair housing rather than only acting defensively by investigating and mediating housing discrimination after the fact. Here is the [Final Report(PDF, 522KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/documents/affh/5697_affh_report_final.pdf) and for the main points, here's the [Report Summary(PDF, 83KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/documents/affh/5698_proposals_summaries.pdf).

**If you would like to review the complete draft recommendations, please [contact us](mailto:human.relations@pittsburghpa.gov).**

**Overview**(show below)

The **Mission** of the AFFH Task Force is to assist in jurisdictions’ efforts to affirmatively further fair housing through identifying barriers and disparities to fair housing and recommending policies to alleviate these barriers and disparities.

The **Goal** of the AFFH Task Force is to help assess current impediments to fair housing choice, and develop policy recommendations that affirmatively further fair housing (AFFH) for the upcoming Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) for the City of Pittsburgh, and other jurisdictions.

The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) Task Force was initiated by the Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations in 2013 as a result of the FY 2012 Update to the Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI) study for the City of Pittsburgh. The AI recommended a “…Countywide Approach to Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing,” and suggested strategies toward the goal of “providing housing and economic opportunities for low and moderate income persons and protected classes to live and work outside impacted areas (Pg. 11).” The strategies include the following:

- 7-A: The City and County’s Human Relations Commissions should establish an Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) Task Force for the Pittsburgh Region with representatives from the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the City Housing Authority (HACP), the Allegheny County Housing Authority (ACHA), the other two federal CDBG Entitlement Communities in Allegheny County (McKeesport and Penn Hills), and other groups and organizations which promote fair housing.
- 7-B: “The four Federal Entitlement jurisdictions should promote and encourage the development of affordable housing and encourage the development of affordable housing throughout the Pittsburgh Region in areas that are not economically or racially impacted.”
- 7-C: “Improve intergovernmental and interagency cooperation in sharing all information pertaining to discrimination cases filed within the jurisdiction of the City of Pittsburgh (Pg. 11).”
