The day concluded with Pichai delivering a distinguished lecture and participating in a fireside chat with CMU [**President Farnam Jahanian**](https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/president/bio) — events that kicked off the [**President's Lecture Series**](https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/president/lecture-series) for the CMU community.

Pichai's tour of campus included a visit to [**Carnegie Mellon Mission Control**](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2024/january/mission-control-reach-out-and-touch-space), a command center for space missions, including the launch of the Iris Lunar Rover and the forthcoming MoonRanger expedition.

While at Mission Control, Pichai met with computer science faculty members as well as members of the [**Iris Lunar Rover**](https://irislunarrover.space/) team, which created a 2 kg. rover which flew into space aboard the Peregrine Lunar Lander in January of 2024.

### GENESIS

Pichai's time on campus also included visiting with computer science faculty and students to learn about GENESIS, which develops faster and easier-to-use physics engines. He then moved on to demonstrations featuring robotic arms and hands, quadruped, and humanoid robots.

### Fireside Chat

After Pichai delivered his distinguished lecture in the new [Highmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics](https://www.cmu.edu/wellbeing/wellbeing-spaces/center/index.html), he joined Jahanian for a fireside chat to talk about his journey and what's on the horizon for AI with regard to energy, governance and workforce development. Both the lecture and fireside chat are part of the CMU's [President's Lecture Series](https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/president/lecture-series), which aims to bring a curated list of thought leaders and world leaders to campus to engage and inspire the Carnegie Mellon community on issues of emerging and preeminent relevance to society.
