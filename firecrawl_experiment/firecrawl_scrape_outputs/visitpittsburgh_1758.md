## DIVING INTO HISTORY + OTHER BACKGROUND

According to the Regent Square Civic Association, this area refers to the group of neighborhoods adjacent to the Hutchinson-Braddock business district, including parts of Pittsburgh, Wilkinsburg, Swissvale and Edgewood. It’s best defined by the following street or landmark borders: Forbes Avenue (on the Northern border); Pennwood Avenue Busway viaduct in Edgewood and Wilkinsburg (Eastern); Parkway East/I376 (Southern) and 644-acre [Frick Park](https://pittsburghparks.org/explore-your-parks/regional-parks/frick-park/) (Western). The latest census number tallies around 3,500 folks calling this place home.

The history of this neighborhood begins with landowners in the late 18th and 19th centuries, including Colonel Dunning McNair and Judge William Watkins. A Regent Square Civic Association leader shares that the neighborhood got its name from William E. Harmon (Harmon Realty). “He acquired it in 1919 when it was known as the Devon Plan. First Harmon called the neighborhood Regent Place, then later decided on the current name. The area was a quiet suburb by the ’50s, and many of its residents worked for Westinghouse. The neighborhood did and still does have an Irish flair in a nod to its original residents (look closely at the names of businesses along Braddock Ave.)"

All American Bowl at Live Fresh Juicery

## SAVORING A DAY IN THE SQUARE

So how to spend a day bopping around this charming Pittsburgh hamlet? Start the adventure with takeaway pastry-and-latte fuel from local caffeine hub 61B, where you’ll likely see furry friends slamming on the brakes for a pup cup served out of the coffee shop’s walk-up window. Or stop into neighboring [**Live Fresh Juicery**](https://www.livefreshjuicery.com/), which came to the neighborhood in Nov. 2022 as a bright, crisp venue for acai bowls and smoothie delights (we can’t get enough of the Popeye’s Buttercup).

Live Fresh staff members encourage samples of their cold-pressed juices and (dairy-free and vegan) nut mylks at any time, and they currently offer $2 off these products during Wednesday and Friday happy hours (4-7 p.m.).

“The eclectic people and welcoming aspect of the community had always drawn us to be patrons in the Square long before we discovered the vacant space,” says co-owner Catey Gilliam.

For a sit-down breakfast, head across the street to newer **Famous Cafe** where you’ll find a variety of omelet, eggs benny and French toast options. Afterward, pause for a photo opp in front of the vibrant “Bird's Eye View” mural by Kristin Williams, located on the side of the convenience store at 1101 South Braddock Avenue. Art lovers might want to cross the street to check out the latest works and intriguing exhibits on display at [**Concept Art Gallery**](https://www.conceptgallery.com/).

Stay Gold Books is a must-see stop for gifts and your next great read

## RELISHING LOCAL RECREATION + RETAIL

Spend some time perusing S. Braddock Ave.’s concentrated cluster of retail gems, like brand-new additions [**Urban Jungle of Regent Square**](https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-jungle-of-regent-square-pittsburgh) and family-owned [**Stay Gold Books**](https://www.staygoldbooks.com/), marked by its can’t-miss pink storefront.

Stay Gold has welcomed excited patrons into its homey space (featuring greenery and a cozy sitting area) since March 19, 2024, “after a year of dreaming and another of planning.” Their main aim? “Primarily to serve our community by providing a ‘place for stories’ as we say,” explains co-owner/operator Corey Wittig.

“The way we're doing that is through offering a curated, high-quality selection of new books for sale for all readers along with gifts largely created by local artists and makers. Another way is through programs and events with local authors and other interesting folks.”

Choosing Regent Square was a no-brainer, with the owners having lived down the street in Park Place for 10 years and Corey's family dating back for generations in Wilkinsburg and the East End. When they hatched the Stay Gold idea, they had one plan: open on Braddock in Regent Square. “We also felt like the neighborhood needed — and would appreciate — a shop like ours,” says Wittig.

Across the street, Dalene Stangl opened plant- and art-filled Urban Jungle May 9 as a “retirement hobby” after 30-plus years in academia. The bright, multi-roomed maze showcases items from large potted treasures and terrarium plants to photography, paintings and sculpture by local talents. Stangl, who’s happily found her store enthusiastically received, says, “I had no idea the sense of community here.”

Love of the outdoors and community collide at 3 Rivers Outdoor Co.

Before delving into nature time on the tranquil trails of the city’s largest historic regional park (Frick), located about five blocks back from Braddock, get inspired at [**3 Rivers Outdoor Co**](https://3riversoutdoor.com/). (or 3ROC). A true community gathering space for the city’s [**outdoor**](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventure/) contingency, the venue not only stocks quality recreation gear and keeps expert staff on hand, but they also run a full lineup of events, ranging from book clubs, film screenings, yoga classes and group runs, to Music Mondays on the front patio and monthly full moon hikes (enjoyed under the nearby canopy of Frick Park).

Events and Social Media Manager Sarah Carr says, “It's a great place to meet like-minded outdoorsy friends for those wondering, 'where do I find people that like to ....(fill in the blank).'"

They opened 3ROC in June 2018 after looking all over the city for a space. “The proximity to Frick Park was a leading draw so we could have access to host trail runs and mountain bike rides weekly as we do,” says Co-Owner and Founder Christine Ferrari-Iksic.

“Easy access to 376, the outside space in front of the shop to host campfires and gatherings, off-street parking and just the vibe of retail and community on S. Braddock Ave. were all also very important in closing the deal.”

Having just hit six years, Ferrari-Iksic admits it's still a hustle as a small business. “We are working hard to just get folks to know we are here and to shop locally versus online or big box stores,” she says. “We love what we do - helping folks get outside and bringing people together around our shared passion for Pittsburgh and the outdoors. However, retail is what funds us to do all the community events.”

They’re constantly striving to provide the right selection of gear and apparel, including used and closeout options for outdoors newbies and budget shoppers. And they remind folks about special order options: “Before you shop online or at big box stores or on Amazon, give us a shout or stop in, and we will work to order you any product you need to complete your outdoor gear or apparel list.”

Recent, fresh brands their staff love include LIVSN pants and overalls, Bedrock sandals and Howler Brothers men's apparel. Soon they’ll also welcome goods from Passenger, “a young, fun, sustainable apparel brand from the UK,” and heritage outdoor brand L.L. Bean which recently started working with small independent retailers like 3ROC. During summers, they also keep busy at their 3ROC Outpost location at [**Allegheny RiverTrail Park**](https://3riversoutdoor.com/pages/rentals-kayak-and-sup), where they rent canoes, kayaks and paddleboards.

In-store Yoga is just one of the many ways 3 Rivers Outdoor Co. goes beyond a normal store

## DELVING INTO DINNER + DRINKS

Food options abound along S. Braddock, whether you’re craving tasty Thai from local BYO spot [**Thai Cottage**](http://thaicottagepgh.com/) (where we’re partial to the fresh rolls with shrimp and noodle dishes like the pad see ew) or a casual feast of carne asada fries, chips and guac, burritos and margaritas from [**El Burro**](https://www.elburropgh.com/). Both have several sidewalk tables, and El Burro has an enclosed patio out back, too. Hit up El Burro’s Monday-through-Friday happy hour (4-6 p.m.) and “Taco Tuesday” specials as well.

Some neighborhood folk might claim [**Frick Park Tavern**](https://www.frickparktavern.com/) (a local favorite since 2019) one of their top eateries in the city, thanks to its consistently bustling air, solid fare and snug decor that instantly whisks you across the Atlantic to a jovial British pub. Amid decor marked by patterned wallpaper, a sleek bartop, tin ceiling, dark wood and dim lighting, tuck into comfort food from meatloaf to roasted chicken with sauteed broccolini and whipped potatoes. Other standouts include the buffalo cauliflower and deviled egg starters, salmon and steak salads, and the blackened tofu sandwich served alongside the venue’s famed fries.

For a more casual night in the Square, sample regional beers and kid-friendly fare at [**D’s Six Pax & Dogz**](https://ds6pax.com/), where sidewalk seating quickly fills on any sun-streaked day. While savoring this true Pittsburgh experience, choose between wings, burgers, hoagies and hot dogs, loaded with decadent toppings like mac and cheese.

If needing a nightcap before the day’s done, sip a low-key pint at Murphy’s Tap Room, where smokers often congregate out front, or take advantage of a cocktail inside newer [**Hemlock House**](https://hemlockhousepgh.com/)’s Pacific Northwest-inspired vibes (in the form of a misty mountain mural and “Twin Peaks” VHS tape relic), plus a late-night happy hour they run from 9 to 11 p.m.

Perhaps Wittig of Stay Gold Books sums up Regent Square best: “The most frequent thing we hear when people walk into the shop is, ‘Welcome to the neighborhood!’ We've heard this from many people, including Mister Rogers' son, which means a lot.”

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271%27%20height%3D%271%27%20style%3D%27background%3Atransparent%27%2F%3E)

One of Pittsburgh's best restaurants + Twin Peaks vibes = your next night out at Hemlock House
