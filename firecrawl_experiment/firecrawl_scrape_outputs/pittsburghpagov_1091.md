## Decks _Not_ Requiring a Building Permit

Uncovered deck where the floor of the deck is no more than 30" (762 mm) above grade. Note: Will require [**Zoning Approval**](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Zoning).

## Decks Requiring a Building Permit

For all other decks, a Building Permit and Occupancy Permit will be required. A completed [Residential Deck Application(PDF, 594KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/pli/documents/residential_deck_application.pdf) and [Residential Building Permit Application(PDF, 327KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/pli/documents/residential_permit_form.pdf) shall be submitted.

Decks can be designed under two options:

- Designed prescriptively per American Wood Council’s “ [Design for Code Acceptance #6 - Prescriptive Residential Wood Deck Construction Guide](https://awc.org/resource-hub/?gsearch=dca%206)”.
- Construction drawings prepared and sealed by a PA licensed architect or engineer.

_**Note:** Any decks other than single story wood decks 8 feet or less in height measured from finish grade to finished deck surface shall require submittal of construction drawings._

## Resource

The American Wood Council's " [Design for Code Acceptance #6 - Prescriptive Residential Wood Deck Construction Guide](https://awc.org/resource-hub/?gsearch=dca%206)" is a valuable resource that can be used to show code compliance for residential wooden decks. This guide includes tables for sizing all structural elements including footings. The sizing for wood members are based on exposure to exterior conditions and weather treatment of certain wood species, both of which reduce structural capacity.

**Note**: This guide requires a minimum post size of 6 x 6.

## 2025 Fee Schedule

The permit and license fees for the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections undergo periodic adjustments.
