## New Americans in Pittsburgh

The “ [New Americans in Pittsburgh](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/styles/publication_cover_style/public/publication_covers/cover_council_new_americans_in_pittsburgh_9_2023.png?itok=bH5PCvml)” report from the American Immigration Council, published on September 11, 2023, shows that immigrants in Pittsburgh contributed approximately $3.5 billion to the city’s gross domestic product (GDP), or 11.1 percent of its GDP.

The report, New Americans in Pittsburgh, was prepared in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh’s Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs, as part of the Council’s and Welcoming America’s [Gateways for Growth Challenge](https://gatewaysforgrowth.org/), which includes tailored research on the local immigrant population.

The report also features profiles of community members: [Khara Timsina](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/profile/bhutanese-immigrant-pittsburgh-supports-all-newcomers), [Brent Rondon](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/proifile/american-moves-pittsburgh-peru-supporting-immigrant-entrepreneurs), [Ebtehal Badawi](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/profile/saudi-arabian-immigrant-social-movement-pittsburgh), and [David Hajayandi](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/profile/burundian-immigrant-community-association-pittsburgh-support-others).
