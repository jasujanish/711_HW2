## Sell What You Grow

You can sell what you grow right in your own neighborhood. You will need an [Outdoor Retail Sales and Service Accessory Use Permit](https://library.municode.com/pa/pittsburgh/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PIZOCO_TITNINEZOCO_ARTVUSRE_CH912ACUSST_912.06OURESASEACUS) from the Zoning department. For that, you will need a site plan that includes identifying where the market stand, customer standing area and trash receptacle will be placed to assure it does not encroach on the public right-of-way or adjacent property.

## Adopt-A-Lot Market Stand Lease

In order to donate or sell uncut, unprocessed produce that you have grown on City-owned land on site, you must complete a [Market Stand Lease](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/City-Planning/Planning-Programs/Adopt-A-Lot).
