# The Art of Quiet: Silent Book Clubs Taking Over Pittsburgh

Welcome to introvert happy hour!

With a recent rise of social media content centered around reading (looking at you, BookTok), book clubs full of passionate page-turners are popping up throughout the country. But what if you want to read your own book at your own pace, as opposed to the traditional deadline for everyone to read the same thing?

## How it works...

Silent Book Club started in San Francisco in 2012 with an idea: what if there was a book club where you could enjoy books, friends, and drinks without any homework? Since then, the idea has sparked into a global community of readers, with nearly 1,500 chapters in more than 50 countries. Every chapter is led by local volunteers with a passion for reading.

Each chapter is different, but the same principle applies to all. Readers are encouraged to bring their own books, whether they be in physical book, audiobook, or Kindle form, and come prepared to dive in. Typically, there's a period of time at the start of each meeting to socialize, order food and drinks, and settle in before the group is encouraged to close their mouths and open their books.

Once the meeting is over, you're free to go about your day however. You can stay and read some more, which I encourage especially if you're in the middle of a chapter; I typically find myself staying an additional 30 minutes after my Silent Book Club \*officially\* concludes just because I can't put my book down.

## SILENT READING ACROSS THE 'BURGH

I might be biased, but this is the Silent Book Club that got me invested in Silent Book Clubs. Aslin's upstairs section is a perfect place to host a book club, and their food and drink options have me coming back even outside of book club. And when the weather breaks, this chapter typically meets in one of Pittsburgh's many parks to soak up some sun and stories.

This is the Silent Book Club that meets the most in Allegheny County. There's something special about meeting up to read books in a winery, especially since Black Dog Wine Company is Western Pennsylvania's most award-winning winery. This chapter of Silent Book Club also meets outdoors when the weather gets nice.

What better place to meet for a book club than in a place where you can get a warm cup of coffee and some sweet pastries? Maybe a place surrounded by more books! This Silent Book Club meets twice a month in two different locations, offering its participants a change of scenery with perfect ambiances for reading.

### [Greenfield, Squirrel Hill, Hazelwood](https://www.instagram.com/silentbookclub.grnsqrlhzl/)

_1st Wednesday of every month \| Varies_

This Silent Book Club is great for those looking for a mid-week pick-me-up. The location of their meet-ups varies, but some previous spots include Rialto's Pizza, Calvary Cemetery, Flagstaff Hill, and Hazelwood Library.

### [East End](https://www.instagram.com/silentbookclub.eastend/)

_1st Sunday of every month \| Trace Brewing/Two Frays Brewery_

This is a fairly newer chapter to Silent Book Club, celebrating its first birthday in April 2025. Its social media is very active, showcasing "Feature Friday" picks of members' favorite reads.

### [Dormont](https://www.instagram.com/silentbookclub_dormont/)

_Last Saturday of every month \| Potomac Station Coffeehouse and 802 Bean Company_

This Silent Book Club is also a fairly new chapter which had its first meeting in May 2024. Its most recent meeting was held at 802 Bean Company for the first time as opposed to its usual spot at Potomac Station Coffeehouse, but no matter which place they hold future meetings at, it will be a great spot to drink some great coffee and enjoy everyone's company.

### [South Hills](https://www.instagram.com/sbc_southhills/)

_1st or 2nd Tuesday of every month \| Porch Siena_

This Silent Book Club is incredibly active, with friendly participants who make everyone attending for the first, second, or ninth time welcome. It frequently hosts or participates in events outside of the club itself, including a flash tattoo party, indie bookstore festivities, and midnight release parties.

A friendly neighborhood Pittsburgh transplant.
Probably at book club, a local coffee shop or thrift store. Tell your pet I said hi.
