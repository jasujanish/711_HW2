# Permits

## Permit Configuration

Permits, Licenses & Inspections (PLI) permit applications and associated requirements are configured based on permit type, structure type, work type, and work scope. Please see [work not requiring a permit](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/Permits/Work-Not-Requiring-a-Permit) for work that can be performed without a PLI permit.

## Permit Type

PLI regulates construction by issuing a separate permit for types of work and for each system type as follows: building, demolition, land operations, signs, electrical systems, mechanical systems (including fuel gas), fire alarm systems, and suppression systems permits. PLI also issues permits that do not include construction as follows: occupancy only, and occupant load placard permits. Please note that [Allegheny County Health Department Plumbing Division](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Services/Health-Department/Plumbing-Program) is responsible for plumbing permits.

The following types of work require a permit:

- To construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish or change the occupancy of a building, structure, and facility.
- To erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert or replace any electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system.

**Residential – single-family**:

- Applicable to detached single-family dwellings and townhouses that are 3 stories or less in height regulated by the _International Residential Code._

- **Minor Alteration**: applicable for existing buildings with a [valid Certificate of Occupancy](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/Applications-Forms/Other-Applications-Forms/Online-Occupancy-Search).
