# Food Access Programs

## Food Insecurity

One in five Pittsburgh residents is food insecure. This means that over 60,000 residents struggle to have healthy, adequate, and culturally appropriate food.

Food insecurity exists when a family is unable to provide enough food for each member of their household to live a healthy, active life. This is a problem that millions of people across the United States face every day, and a variety of situations can cause a family to become food insecure, including lay-offs, accidents, and illness. Some causes of food insecurity are more systemic, but no matter the cause, the effects of food insecurity have a wide impact. Food insecurity can cause serious health problems, inhibit a child’s development, and force seniors living on a fixed income to choose between food and health care.

The [2020 FeedPGH Report(PDF, 16MB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/documents/16669_feedpgh_print_version_11.18.21.pdf) describes the four dimensions of food insecurity, based on the United Nation’s 2018 report, identifies 23 _Healthy Food Priority Areas_ in Pittsburgh through extensive mapping, outlines the City's goals to achieve Zero Hunger, and pinpoints some key next steps.

The [FeedPGH City Council District Food Security Analysis(PDF, 8MB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/documents/10267_all_districts_report_2020.pdf) provides insight into food insecurity in each Council District. Considering factors such as household poverty, vehicle ownership, fresh food store walk-ability, and diet-related chronic disease, the city has determined Healthy Food Priority Areas. These areas are the places of highest need and require focused effort in order to promote food equity in Pittsburgh.

The [HFPA Dashboard](https://pittsburghpa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/258efdabee52426f8335890733e8ef49) can be used to explore the underlying data and equity metrics.
