## Notices

**Public Notice of City of Pittsburgh Other Post Employment Benefit Trust Fund Selection of a Professional Service Provider**

**_November 13, 2024_**

The City of Pittsburgh Other Post Employment Benefit Trust Fund (“OPEB”) issued a Request for Proposals on September 19, 2024. OPEB sought proposals from qualified providers to serve as the custodian and investment advisor to the Board of Trustees (“Board”) of the OPEB.

After a thorough review of each of the subsequently received proposals at the meeting of the Board on November 13, 2024, the Board elected to retain Marquette Associates as the investment advisor because of the following reasons: Marquette Associates has experience in providing investment consulting to entities similar to OPEB and Marquette Associates proposed a flat fee at a competitive rate.

**The OPEB Fund is searching for custodial and investment services.
