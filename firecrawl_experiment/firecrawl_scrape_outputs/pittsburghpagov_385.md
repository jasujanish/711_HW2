| Pittsburgh Selected for Reforestation Hubs Initiative | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 4, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has been selected by [Cambium Carbon](https://www.cambiumcarbon.com/) in partnership with the [Arbor Day Foundation](https://www.arborday.org/) as one of four cities nationally to receive a “Reforestation Hub” assessment, which includes the development of an innovative pilot project geared toward improving resource efficiency and carbon capture at the municipal level with the Department of City Planning Office of Sustainability & Resilience, Department of Public Works Forestry Division, and community partners. These projects will lay the groundwork for a circular urban forestry system that will include urban wood reuse and carbon credits to finance healthy forests, restoration of public lands, and the recovery and expansion of the tree canopy.   <br>Despite the positive impacts urban forests have in combating climate change and providing community benefits, American cities lose an average [36 million trees](https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2018/nrs_2018_nowak_005.pdf) each year due to factors such as disease, age, and development, which results in economic losses up to $786 million annually. The City of Pittsburgh’s tree canopy coverage is currently estimated at 41%, after a loss of 3% of total landcover between 2010 and 2015. Contributors to local canopy loss in the city include development pressure; pests, invasive species, and disease; and lack of maintenance, capacity, and funding. Reforestation Hubs aim to close the loop on urban wood waste by finding ways to upcycle removed trees to their highest use while generating new revenues to support tree planting and maintenance.   <br>“City governments need to find new sources of funding to recover from the pandemic and providing healthy, accessible outdoor open spaces has proven critically important for the health of our residents over the last nine months,” said Mayor William Peduto. “The City of Pittsburgh is very excited for this timely opportunity to explore new methods of ecological and financial resilience that seek to enhance our tree canopy and greenspaces to improve resident well-being.”  <br>The City’s work with Cambium Carbon will explore two new revenue sources for forest maintenance: first, finding a pathway for wood reuse from fallen city trees and handling wood debris in-house. Additionally, the project will assess the sale of carbon credits as a means of subsidizing restoration of public lands, with particular focus on the greenways system. The intention is to use these new financing mechanisms and efficiencies to properly resource the Department of Public Works’ Forestry Division and nonprofit partners to increase tree canopy and improve the health of Pittsburgh’s unmanaged greenways and urban forest. <br>Much of the City of Pittsburgh’s green space was consolidated into the [Greenways for Pittsburgh program](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/greenways) in the 1980s. Greenways comprise 1,200 acres across 13 sites throughout city neighborhoods and have faced significant neglect over time. The City's [Climate Action Plan 3.0](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7101_Pittsburgh_Climate_Action_Plan_3.0.pdf) calls for increases in tree canopy coverage and carbon sequestration, as well as for unmanaged open space to be properly valued for its ecosystem services and not looked at as a loss of tax revenue. As the weather becomes wetter, hotter, and more unpredictable in Pittsburgh, our urban ecosystems need to be valued as a first line of defense against the changing climate.  <br>“Pittsburgh’s tree canopy and urban forests provide many benefits, but resources are needed to make all of our greenspaces the community assets they should be,” said Lisa Ceoffe, City Forester. “Optimizing the health of some of our unmanaged public properties and increasing tree canopy will create more opportunities for recreation, improve stormwater management, provide shade and cooling in summer months, stabilize our hillsides, sequester carbon and air pollution, and deter dumping.”  <br>The City of Pittsburgh will be joining Denver, Colorado, Eugene, Oregon and New York City, New York in the Reforestation Hubs programs. These cities’ projects will build off of the work of innovative peer cities, including that of [The Baltimore Wood Project](http://baltimorewoodproject.org/) and Philadelphia Parks and Recreation.   <br>“These pilots are step one in building a circular economy for urban forestry,” said Marisa Repka, Co-Founder and City Partnerships Lead at Cambium Carbon. “We’re excited to work with our city partners to make the case for infrastructure and policy that will improve resource efficiency, create new jobs, and foster community resilience.”   <br>In addition, Cambium Carbon will be launching a Reforestation Hubs Peer Working Group to share learnings, resources, and opportunities.

More than 1 million members, supporters, and valued partners have helped the Arbor Day Foundation plant more than 350 million trees in neighborhoods, communities, cities, and forests throughout the world to ensure a greener and healthier future for everyone. <br>**This press release was updated on 1/8/2021 to reflect updated data for the city's tree canopy coverage and estimated loss between 2010 and 2015. It was previously reported at 36% with a 6% loss between 2010 and 2015.

| City Announces Updates to Snow Operations | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 4, 2021)  Mayor William Peduto and City Council Public Works Committee Chairman Anthony Coghill announced new snow operations procedures effective immediately to improve the City’s response and treatment of city streets during inclement winter weather. The new procedures are part of the City's commitment that every street in the city should be treated quickly and effectively.  <br>Operational improvements include updates to staffing procedures, improvements to Snow Plow Tracker, and working to ensure the right amount of salt is distributed on streets. The Mayor’s Office worked with the Department of Public Works (DPW), Pittsburgh Joint Collective Bargaining Committee (PJCBC) chairman Joseph Laquatra and his designated representatives, and Councilman Coghill to develop the new plans.   <br>The City and PJCBC, who represents hundreds of DPW employees, developed a sidebar union agreement establishing an improved procedure for communicating with and assigning staff during snow events to ensure an appropriate number of vehicles are out to treat and clear streets. The procedure includes a new mass texting and robocall system to make sure employees are reached and notified of overtime opportunities faster.  When they receive the call or text, employees are able to volunteer for available slots. If overtime slots are not filled voluntarily, the process moves to assigning mandated overtime to employees by reverse seniority. If available staffing slots remain unfilled, the City can then call in private contractors.   <br>During the Christmas snowfall, data from vehicles who were in a specific mode for salt distribution was not being shared to Snow Plow Tracker, so there were several trucks on the road that were not showing up on the map. This discrepancy has been addressed and trucks who are in this mode will now show up on the tracker. The Snow Plow Tracker website has been updated to advise users that not all plowing vehicles may be visible on the map when activated. Snow Plow Tracker is an important part of the City's commitment to transparency and accountability. <br>Additionally, DPW identified that some streets during the last snowfall were receiving inadequate amounts of salt from trucks. Public Works staff is working with supervisors, heavy equipment maintenance, and vendors to make sure that the right amount of salt is being dropped when trucks are working their routes.  <br>"Keeping our roads safe for all users during winter storms is a fundamental responsibility of city government. We will continue to use technology, best practices, and partnerships with our workforce and unions to provide the public the services they deserve," said Mayor William Peduto.  <br>“The Mayor and I are committed to improving the treatment of our roads for all residents and neighborhoods in District 4 and the City at large, and the changes being announced today are the result of a review of operational procedures and will result in clear and direct improvement in snow treatment,” said Councilman Coghill. “I am appreciative of the work of the administration, the PJCBC, and DPW to address these issues following December’s record setting storms.” <br>This operations update builds upon additional improvements that have been implemented in recent years, including training additional drivers, reviewing 311 reports to ensure equitable service in our neighborhoods, and adjusting optimized routes to address recurring areas of concern. | 4/1/2021 15:07:46 |

| Welcoming Pittsburgh and URA Complete National Welcoming Economies Pilot Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 8, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Welcoming Pittsburgh and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) have announced the completion of [Welcoming America](https://www.welcomingamerica.org/)’s [2020 Welcoming Economies Technical Assistance Pilot](https://www.welcomingamerica.org/news/three-communities-join-2020-welcoming-economies-technical-assistance-pilot) (WE Pilot) program.The WE Pilot supports local leaders in advancing policies, programs, partnerships, and practices that include immigrants as part of their local or regional economic strategy.  <br>Throughout the year, the WE Pilot team and other national experts provided the City and URA with more than 20 hours of direct technical assistance, access to subject area experts, hands-on coaching, and peer learning opportunities to advance the economic inclusion of immigrants and contribute to local economic development efforts that impact all residents.  <br>“We are proud of the work that Welcoming Pittsburgh and the URA have accomplished as part of this pilot,” said Mayor William Peduto. “With Welcoming Economies’ support, we are continuing to realize the vision laid out by our immigrant and refugee communities in the Welcoming Pittsburgh Roadmap so that all feel welcome here and find support in successful housing and small business endeavors that make our city stronger.” <br>In 2015, the City launched the [Welcoming Pittsburgh Roadmap](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/mayorpeduto/WelcomingPittsburgh_RoadMap_FullReport_FINAL2.pdf) in partnership with 40 leaders in immigrant, refugee, and international communities and over 3,000 community members. The roadmap provides a community-defined vision and recommended action items to make Pittsburgh welcoming for all. Using the Welcoming Pittsburgh Roadmap as guidance for the WE Pilot, Welcoming Pittsburgh and the URA focused on enhancing interagency and community partnerships and increasing access to housing and small business programs. <br>They implemented the following: <br>Housing Initiatives <br>- Prevented evictions with over 100 immigrant and refugee households through the [Housing Stabilization Program](https://www.ura.org/pages/housing-opportunity-fund-programs)<br>- Modified current housing program applications to capture utilization rates by the immigrant and refugee population <br>- Strengthened community partnerships by reporting WE Pilot initiatives and progress during Welcoming Pittsburgh’s bimonthly calls with immigrant and refugee community stakeholders <br>- Developed and implemented a language access plan to ensure information and materials about [housing resources from the Housing Opportunity Fund were translated](https://www.ura.org/pages/housing-opportunity-fund-programs)<br>- Implemented a universal language access plan with 15 service providers in the Housing Stabilization Program, ensuring residents have language access from beginning to end <br>- Developed a URA-specific working group tasked with developing and implementing an organization wide Language Access Plan <br>- Collaborated and formalized working relationships between the URA and Welcoming Pittsburgh to further equitable access to housing and economic development <br>Small Business Initiatives <br>- Created goals to support diverse businesses to recover and grow during the COVID-19 pandemic <br>- Modified current small business program applications to capture utilization rates by the immigrant and refugee population <br>- Provided Recovery Loan Program assistance to 11 immigrant-owned businesses <br>- Granted Minority Recovery and Growth funding to four immigrant-owned businesses  <br>- Expanded community partnerships to include organizations that provide business support such as the University of Pittsburgh Small Business Development Center, Bhutanese Community Association of Pittsburgh, and Financial Empowerment Centers <br>- Compiled a growing [directory of internationally-owned businesses in the city](https://drive.google.com/file/d/109HaDH4BkGBYju9r_mXd4rvJSAjF7E6t/view?usp=sharing)<br>“The URA is very excited to continue the work we started during the Welcoming Economies pilot to ensure that new city residents are aware of all the programs we have to offer,” said URA Executive Director Greg Flisram. “We can become an even better city when people from all walks of life utilize our tools to build an inclusive and economically resilient Pittsburgh.” <br>Welcoming Pittsburgh and the URA will continue their involvement with Welcoming America beyond the WE Pilot. Jeremy Carter, HOF program manager, and Vethina Hage, housing strategy officer, were recently named to [Welcoming America’s Content Advisory Board for the Welcoming Standard](https://www.welcomingamerica.org/news/announcing-advisory-group-selections-review-welcoming-standard). The Welcoming Standard is a guiding set of principles that outlines the core of what it means for communities to be truly welcoming for immigrants, refugees, and all residents. <br>Welcoming Pittsburgh and the URA have formally agreed to continue their partnership beyond the WE Pilot in order to continue working toward improved housing and small business outcomes for immigrant and refugee communities. They are currently conducting a citywide survey to understand what residents need to help increase homeownership in order to design appropriate support programs. All residents are encouraged to participate by February 1, 2021 and the survey is available on [Welcoming Pittsburgh’s website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/wp/). | 8/1/2021 10:14:56 |
| City Announces Sixth PGH Lab Cohort | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 8, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh Department of Innovation & Performance (I&P) have announced the selection of the sixth cohort of the PGH Lab government incubator program. <br>PGH Lab connects local startup companies with the City of Pittsburgh and local government agencies to explore new ways to use technology and innovative solutions to help improve city operations and the lives of residents. The program provides an opportunity for local startups to test their beta-stage products and services in a real-world environment for up to six months with a city department or partner agency, called their “City Champion,” using Pittsburgh as an urban lab. <br>Since 2016, the City of Pittsburgh and partnering agencies have successfully completed five cycles engaging 24 local startups, putting forth a variety of innovative pilot projects ranging from waste management to immigrant inclusion initiatives. <br>This year, PGH Lab has shifted to focus on tech solutions through an equity lens, to intentionally provide opportunities for startups that are owned and operated by communities typically underrepresented in tech. Two citywide tech issues were highlighted during the application process for startups to provide possible solutions to. First, to address the city’s sidewalk and ADA ramp inventory to better serve resident accessibility needs, and second, to provide possible solutions to the city’s paper and pencil intake forms. Additionally, startups were encouraged to provide solutions for the following categories of: resident engagement, improving city operations (data solutions or smart cities,) and climate change and the environment.  <br>The City of Pittsburgh welcome the sixth cohort of startups that will utilize Pittsburgh as their urban lab:  <br>[**pathVu**](http://pathvu.com/) records and collects sidewalk and curb ramp data using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and other technical methods.<br>* * *<br>[**Sustainible**](https://sustainible.io/) is an input/output (IO) powered Venture Feasibility Engine that evaluates business models to determine the model’s feasibility and sustainability.<br>* * *<br>[**AdSkate**](https://www.adskate.com/) helps partnering organizations reach the right audience by providing media support.<br>* * *<br>[**Beamdata**](https://beam-data.com/) offers a free civic engagement app (iOS and web platform) called “Be the Change," that connects you to your elected officials and local advocacy.<br>* * *<br>[**Civic Champs**](https://civicchamps.com/) pilots a mobile app "Helping Hands" that allows individuals and organizations in need of volunteer assistance to be matched with readily available volunteers.<br>* * *<br>[**Footbridge for Families**](https://afootbridge.org/) fills in the gap for families facing short-term financial crises so they don't require more costly solutions or threaten to overwhelm caregivers.<br>* * *<br>[**The Center for Empathy Education**](https://centerforempathyeducation.com/) provides primarily two services: professional development training and company culture strategizing.<br>* * *<br>[**Jireh Mobile**](https://www.jirehmobile.com/) **o** ffers a communication platform that allow residents to communicate in real time with city and county entities.<br>These startup companies will be paired with City Champions throughout city departments and/or partner agencies like the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parking Authority, Allegheny County Airport Authority, Allegheny County Economic Development, Allegheny County Health Department, Pittsburgh Sewer and Water Authority, and Allegheny County Port Authority.<br>For more news and updates to come visit the [PGH Lab website](http://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/pghlab/index.html), follow PGH Lab on Twitter at [@PghIP](https://twitter.com/PghIP) or follow the [Innovation & Performance Medium](https://medium.com/department-of-innovation-performance).<br>For questions contact: Itha Cao – PGH Lab Program Manager at [pghlab@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:pghlab@pittsburghpa.gov). | 8/1/2021 12:30:56 |

| City Reaches New Agreement for Crossing Guards | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 13, 2020) Mayor William Peduto announced that the City has finalized a new contract for City of Pittsburgh crossing guards. The five-year contract was negotiated with the crossing guards’ representatives from the Service Employees International Union – 192B.  <br>The new contract increases the base wage for crossing guards to $15 per hour with an annual wage increase to 2024. Under previous contracts, crossing guards were not eligible for municipal pension plans since the position was considered part-time. Under the new agreement, crossing guards who work over 200 hours in a year will be able to participate in the municipal pension plan.  <br>“We are excited to have reached this agreement with our crossing guards who provide an important service for our city,” said Mayor William Peduto.  “I’d like to thank SEIU-192B for their cooperation and our crossing guards for their commitment to the safety of our communities.”  <br>The School Crossing Guards division operates from the administrative branch of the Department of Public Safety. In addition to the primary responsibility of ensuring school children and pedestrians can safely cross busy streets and intersections, crossing guards provide additional support and traffic control during special events. During the pandemic, crossing guards have continued to assist children in schools who have been attending in-person classes.   <br>“Being a school crossing guard is a very self rewarding job,” said Elaine Alter, crossing guard supervisor. “Children, parents, motorist, and tourists all rely on the guards daily and look to them for direction. They have become the ambassadors for the City of Pittsburgh — assisting with lost children, directions, or just general information. They are the eyes and ears of the community. Children in the city of Pittsburgh become the guards' ‘children’ and they love them and worry about them no less than if they were their own.” | 13/1/2021 16:05:21 |

| Court Upholds Peduto Campaign Finance Law | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 19, 2021) A Common Pleas judge today ruled in favor of the campaign finance law written by then-Councilman William Peduto and implemented by the City of Pittsburgh Ethics Hearing Board. <br>The order issued by Judge Joseph James says the provisions and campaign finance regulations in the Pittsburgh campaign law are legal, as they follow similar regulations adopted by Philadelphia under its Home Rule powers that were upheld by the state Supreme Court. The judge’s order was in response to a suit filed by former Councilwoman Darlene Harris in 2019 saying the Pittsburgh legislation was preempted by state law and could not be enforced. <br>As a councilman Peduto was the main author of the good government bill in 2010. <br>“In a time when campaign finance rules and our ability to track political influence on elected officials are being gutted through decisions like _Citizens United_ this is a major victory,” Mayor Peduto said. “It’s a win for transparency, for common-sense oversight of campaign spending, and most importantly for City of Pittsburgh voters. We are pleased with the Court repeatedly upholding these reasonable regulations, and for holding candidates accountable for their contributions and spending,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>A copy of today’s order [is available here.](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12822_Campaign_law_OPINION.pdf) | 19/1/2021 16:45:32 |
| City of Pittsburgh Joins National Memorial to Lives Lost to COVID-19 | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 19, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh will be participating in the national Memorial to Lives Lost to COVID-19 this evening by illuminating the City-County Building. <br>The memorial will take place in Washington D.C. at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, and continue at 5:30 p.m. local time in cities and towns across the country.

| Peduto Administration Proposes Zoning Changes to Reduce Sidewalk Curb Cuts | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 19, 2021) Mayor William Peduto’s administration introduced legislation to Pittsburgh City Council today that would reduce the use of sidewalk curb cuts by requiring side or rear access to parking at rowhouses. <br>Last year the Department of City Planning [introduced a zoning amendment](https://pittsburgh.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4389692&GUID=96AAE42D-6245-4669-9380-68B3B832B885&Options=ID|Text|&Search=curb+cuts) that eliminated parking requirements for new rowhouses, which was leading to a proliferation of curb cuts and first-floor garages that created hazardous conditions for pedestrians and added to the cost of housing.  <br>Today’s legislation takes those changes a step further by requiring developers to provide parking off of alleys or side streets whenever possible. If that access is unavailable, access to parking can be provided on the street using shared driveways.  <br>“This change further discourages breaks in the sidewalks in our rowhouse neighborhoods, better ensuring pedestrian safety by creating fewer points where pedestrians and cars intersect, and ensuring that less on-street parking will be privatized for driveways along streets in these neighborhoods,” Planning Director Andrew Dash said. <br>The legislation says in part: <br>_WHEREAS, these proposed changes to the Zoning Code will reduce the number of curb cuts along neighborhood sidewalks, improve safety for pedestrians, individuals with disabilities, and other users of our streets and sidewalks, limit the removal of on-street parking spaces, and maintain the historic character of our neighborhoods._<br>The legislation would have particular impact on neighborhoods such as Lawrenceville. <br>"Driveway curb cuts on our rowhouse blocks can be a serious impediment to walkability, accessibility, affordability, and the quality of our public realm. We appreciate Mayor Peduto's leadership in ensuring that future development protects the qualities that make our rowhouse neighborhoods great places to live," said Dave Breingan, executive director of Lawrenceville United. <br>The legislation is set to be referred to the Planning Commission when it is up for discussion at Council’s Standing Committees meeting on Wednesday, January 27th. It will then be sent back to Council with a positive or negative recommendation. <br>The full text of the zoning change [is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12810_Parking_Access_Ordinance__FINAL.pdf). | 19/1/2021 11:01:29 |

| Mayor Peduto Joins Bipartisan Call for Pandemic and Local Government Relief | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 20, 2021) Mayor William Peduto has joined a bipartisan coalition of more than 280 mayors nationwide calling on Congress to take action on pandemic and local government relief measures.<br>The local leaders, in conjunction with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, wrote Congressional leaders to urge support of President Biden’s new plan to end the pandemic and save the American economy by providing direct fiscal relief to all cities— large, medium, and small—and boosting support for America’s vaccination program.<br>As the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage communities and cause economic suffering, the President has put forward a comprehensive package of relief measures that includes $350 billion in direct aid to state and local governments. The letter from 284 mayors, [available in full here](https://www.usmayors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mayors-Letter-on-American-Rescue-Plan-011921-PDF.pdf), urges Congress to support the measures.<br>It says in part:<br>"American cities and our essential workers have been serving at the frontlines of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for nearly a year. We have been charged with executing herculean public health efforts and an unprecedented emergency response. Despite immense fiscal pressure, your local government partners oversaw those efforts, while trying to maintain essential services and increase our internal capacity to provide support for residents and businesses who have been crippled by a tanking economy.<br>And yet, as the economic engines of our country, local governments will be relied upon to lead the longterm economic recovery our nation so desperately needs, even as, with few exceptions, cities have been largely left without direct federal assistance. The lack of adequate support has resulted in budget cuts, service reductions, and job losses. Sadly, nearly one million local government jobs have already been lost during the pandemic. Our essential workers deserve federal relief like any other sector." | 20/1/2021 10:58:41 |

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on White House Executive Orders | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 21, 2021) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement on the Executive Orders signed by President Joseph Biden on the COVID-19 pandemic, climate, equity, and the economy: <br>“The 17 orders signed by President Biden yesterday and the important governing priorities set with Vice President Kamala Harris will guide the United States back onto its rightful leadership course for Americans and the rest of the world.  <br>All of these actions will benefit the residents of Pittsburgh, and mirror longtime efforts by my administration to ensure equity, opportunity and safety for all. <br>Rejoining the Paris Climate Accords has a special import for our city given our worldwide leadership role in battling climate change, which has been remained unwavering despite the misguided efforts by former President Trump and his allies to label us otherwise. <br>Recommitting to the Accords shows our country’s resolve to face twin challenges of our time — climate change and economic injustice — and reinforces the belief that we can solve the problems confronting us by working together and fostering innovation. <br>All of the principles being followed by the Biden-Harris administration — from promoting immigration to fostering equity to protecting those facing economic woe — are priorities of Pittsburgh as well. Cities like ours never abandoned our commitments to save our planet and our people. Instead we doubled down, and today we remain ready to work with President Biden and Vice President Harris to create jobs, rebuild our infrastructure and ensure a better environment for all.” <br>A full list of White House orders and actions [is available here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/). | 21/1/2021 11:29:28 |
| Pittsburgh Joins Legal Fight Against Trump Cuts to Emissions Standards | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 21, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh is continuing its legal fight against Trump Administration Environmental Protection Agency moves to roll back vehicle emissions standards. <br>The City is joining the National League of Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Local Government Coalition and 14 other municipalities and counties in an amicus brief filed with the DC Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals seeking to block EPA rules that they argue will hurt efforts to fight air pollution. <br>The brief references efforts by Pittsburgh to address pollution in its Climate Action Plan and criticizes the EPA for failing to perform proper environmental justice analysis, which would show disparate impacts of the rules upon minority and/or low-income populations.   <br>“Now is not the time to be rolling back pollution and air quality standards, especially when President Biden has ordered the United States re-join the Paris Climate Accords,” Mayor William Peduto said. “Pittsburgh and other cities are already acting to significantly reduce emissions, knowing that the costs of inaction will only get worse in the near future.” <br>The amicus brief’s filing coincides with President Biden’s first set of environmental and climate executive orders and a directive from the Biden-Harris administration’s incoming EPA Administrator to revoke the Trump Administration’s Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule, which rolled back required fuel efficiency improvements for new cars and light-duty trucks. <br>The Local Government Coalition represents more than 10 million U.S. residents. Those signing onto today’s brief (in addition to Pittsburgh) include: Annapolis, Maryland; Boulder County, Colorado; Glen Rock, New Jersey; Harris County, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Providence, Rhode Island; Saint Paul, Minnesota; Salt Lake City, Utah; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and the Mayors of Durham, North Carolina; Fayetteville, Arkansas; Las Cruces, New Mexico; and Phoenix, Arizona. <br>The brief mentions: <br>- Pittsburgh's participation in the Local Government Coalition "first responders to climate change," working to reduce risks from transportation pollution. <br>- Pittsburgh's 2017 Climate Action Plan and efforts to reduce emissions 20% by 2023, 50% by 2030, and 80% by 2050, as compared to 2003 levels. <br>- Pittsburgh's calculation that transportation accounts for approximately 18% of greenhouse gas emissions. <br>- Pittsburgh data showing high levels of asthma and exposure to unhealthy levels of particulate matter as a rationale for action.<br>The full amicus brief [is available here](https://climate.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/State_of_California,_et_al_v.__77.pdf). | 21/1/2021 13:17:32 |

| Mayor Peduto and City Council Approve Resolution Condemning Domestic Terror and Attack on U.S. Capitol | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 26, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and all members of Pittsburgh City Council today approved a resolution in conjunction with the Anti-Defamation League condemning the insurrection against the U.S. Capitol on January 6 and all domestic terror actions in the country. <br>The resolution calls on all residents to reject extremism and disinformation, and to uphold democratic values, particularly in response to hate crimes such as the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill, which was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history. <br>City Council members Corey O’Connor and Erika Strassburger, who represent Squirrel Hill, were the prime sponsors of the resolution with Mayor Peduto. <br>The resolution says in part: “the Mayor and the Council of City of Pittsburgh are hereby committed to countering hate, extremism, misinformation, and disinformation through engagement with community leaders, governmental transparency, and public information-sharing regarding efforts to fight extremism, and through the investigation and prosecution of those who commit criminal acts in a manner that is consistent with civil liberties protections;  <br>and . . . the Mayor and Council of the City of Pittsburgh do hereby urge Pittsburgh’s residents, institutions, and corporations to join us in adopting anti-extremist values, condemning and rejecting misinformation, disinformation, hate, and extremism in all forms, and calling attention to these harms to keep us all safe.” | 26/1/2021 10:14:50 |

| Pittsburgh Police Giving Recruits Cutting-Edge New Training on Homelessness | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 27, 2020) Under changes implemented by the Peduto Administration, Pittsburgh police recruits are receiving unique training to understand the experiences of residents who are homeless, the availability of services, and the impact of public safety involvement on displaced people, through the “Homelessness Academy” program at the police training academy. <br>The program is being implemented by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police in conjunction with the Office of Community Health & Safety in Mayor William Peduto’s office, and the Department of Public Safety’s Office of Community Services and Violence Prevention.  <br>The programs are part of Mayor Peduto’s efforts to give front-line workers more support when interacting with residents in desperate need of social services, and a reassessment generally of the City’s relations with displaced people.  <br>For many police, the first time in their lives that they ever come into contact with a homeless resident is when they start on the job as a police officer. To ease that transition the Homelessness Academy gives recruits background on complexities that people experience living outside,  trauma, reasons why people do not stay in shelters, and how polices can help by engaging responsive supportive services. <br>After the initial Homelessness Academy trainings recruits were surveyed for their reactions: 28% reported they had never had a conversation with someone experiencing homelessness before, and 71% said the training gave them a better familiarity with the issue. <br>Through the program recruits hear first-hand from a community advocate who experienced homelessness, learn from an Allegheny Health Network official on the unique challenges facing residents experiencing homelessness, and review the resources police can deploy to assist people. <br>The academy — borne out of collaborative efforts with the Homeless Outreach Coordination Committee and Resource Office — is a joint initiative with OCHS, which Mayor Peduto launched last summer to oversee social and public health services supporting community members and first responders who regularly interface with residents needing assistance and harm reduction support.  <br>It is also a result of [the City’s partnership with AHN’s Center for Inclusion Health](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4154) to provide street outreach community-based teams to help with service delivery to residents with unmet needs. <br>“This is a continuation of Police’s years-long focus on building bridges with all communities in Pittsburgh,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “Our goal is to have the best police bureau in the country, with officers who receive training that is second to none. I applaud this multi-agency cooperation the initiative shown by the Police leadership and the Academy in providing this crucial training.”   <br>Police training in Pennsylvania is regulated by the Municipal Police Officers’ Education and Training Commission (MPOETC). Law enforcement agencies are allowed to offer additional training beyond what MPOETC requires, which includes programs like the Homelessness Academy, which is tailored to Pittsburgh’s unique issues. <br>“This program better prepares recruits to look at social issues with a guardian mindset. It opens their eyes to the reality and the humanity of the situation and provides them with a better understanding of the key issues related to homelessness,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said.  <br>The training program is overseen by Sgt. Colleen Bristow, who has worked to enhance the MPOETC to better prepare officers for community needs, and features remarks by community advocate and leader Kelly Ferri and AHN homeless and urban poverty director Dan Palka, as well as by police leaders who talk to recruits about their experiences and how they build empathy for those living on the street.  <br>“Community members and people working directly in the community are our experts. It is the responsibility of the Office of Community Health & Safety to support residents and first responders by ensuring that services are available, responsive, and low barrier,” OCHS Manager Laura Drogowski said. “Police and EMS are the last safety net – with this training, we work to help officers understand that treating people with dignity, respect, and support can change their experiences.” | 27/1/2021 13:12:26 |

| Peduto Administration Legislation Makes Juneteenth a City Holiday | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 1, 2021) Mayor William Peduto is introducing a bill to City Council following up on his pledge to make Juneteenth an official City holiday. <br>The Mayor [announced in August](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4265) at a Black Voting Rights Forum at St. Benedict the Moor Church in the Lower Hill District that “Juneteenth reminds us of the rich history of Black Pittsburgh and celebrates those who worked hard so that Black people’s voices could be heard through voting.”    <br>“Throughout history, many have tried to silence Black voices. We have arrived in a critical time where they are finally getting the attention that they deserve – and they are being heard. Many of us, particularly privileged white men, have not always listened as much as we should have. The time is now to make that change permanent, and formally set aside this holiday to celebrate Black voices.” <br>Since the June 19th holiday falls this year on a Saturday, it is set to be celebrated on Friday, June 18th.  <br>The legislation from the Department of Human Resources and Civil Service is set to be introduced tomorrow and discussed at Council’s Standing Committees meeting on February 10. | 1/2/2021 10:36:48 |

| City and County to Establish $36 Million COVID-19 Emergency Rental Assistance Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 2, 2021) A proposal to establish an Emergency Rental Assistance Program to assist those impacted financially from the COVID-19 crisis was introduced to Pittsburgh City Council today. <br>The City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County are partnering with Action Housing and Dollar Energy to establish the emergency program using federal funds in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was signed into law on December 27. The County received $27 million and the City $8.9 million in U.S. Treasury grants under the Act, for assisting households having trouble paying rent and utilities due to the pandemic. <br>“In 2020, we were able to help many in our community, but also know that despite our efforts, massive need still exists,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “This partnership with the City of Pittsburgh and ACTION will allow us to meet this challenge with a larger pool of funds to help those in need.” <br>Allegheny County successfully partnered with ACTION Housing in 2020 to provide over $14 million in rental relief to 3,600 households in the county. The existing partnership and infrastructure along with learned lessons from the first program will lead to a smoother, more expedient process for applicants.  <br>The City and County are working quickly to establish the local rental assistance program, since under the federal law at least 65% of the grant funds must be expended by September 30 of this year. The Peduto Administration is introducing the City’s grant funding to City Council today and asking for an expedited Council vote by next week. <br>“People all around the Pittsburgh region continue to be hurt by COVID-19 in ways that go far beyond the health catastrophe of the pandemic, as they are stuck at home contending with employment uncertainty, educational worries and emotional distress. But if that home itself is in danger, people could lose all hope,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>Under federal regulations grant funding can be used for rent, rental arrears, utilities, utility arrears, and other housing expenses resulting from the pandemic for households meeting certain income criteria. The assistance can last up to 12 months plus an additional three months, if necessary, to ensure housing stability. <br>Although more details are forthcoming from the federal government that are needed to launch the program, prospective applicants can express interest and sign up to receive program updates at [https://covidrentrelief.alleghenycounty.us/](https://covidrentrelief.alleghenycounty.us/). Additional details about the federal grants are [available here](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares/emergency-rental-assistance-program). <br>_Contacts:_<br>Amie M.

| City to Partner with FUSE Corps on Police-Community Relations, Workforce Development and Adult Diversion Programs | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 2, 2021) The Peduto Administration is partnering with the nonprofit FUSE Corps to host three researchers to work on community-police relations, job opportunities for students, and creating an adult diversion program to help keep residents from entering the criminal justice system. <br>The nonprofit support will build off initiatives already being implemented by the Office of Community Services and Violence Prevention within the Department of Public Safety and the Community Task Force on Police Reform.<br>[FUSE](https://www.fusecorps.org/about/) offers the services from its fellows for 12 months, free of charge. Since 2002 the nonprofit has partnered with more than 100 cities nationwide to address urban issues and help cities thrive. Fuse has [helped Pittsburgh before](https://www.fusecorps.org/locations/pittsburgh-pa/) with issues such as improving public housing and improving city buildings. <br>The proposed new projects are: “Creating Pathways to High-Paying Careers for Pittsburgh’s Students,” “Strengthening Relationships Between Police and the Pittsburgh Community,” and "Launching Diversion Initiatives to Reduce Racial Disparities in Incarceration.” <br>A proposed agreement to accept the FUSE services will be introduced to City Council today. <br>Through the career project, the FUSE executive fellow will start with a listening tour “connecting with leadership at Pittsburgh Public Schools and Partner4Work, and then branching out to include the region’s largest employers, students and other key stakeholders. At the end of the listening tour, the Executive Fellow will have developed recommendations for promising pathways (e.g. Emergency Medical Services, etc.) that have the most potential to secure post-program agreements. These pathways will most likely have existing strong training options and shortages of qualified job candidates.” <br>The project will build upon successes at the Public Safety Academy at Westinghouse High School, which trains Pittsburgh Public Schools students for future careers as firefighters, paramedics and police. <br>Another fellow will focus on possibly creating a police athletic league, as part of ongoing efforts by the new Office of Community Services and Violence Prevention. <br>The project proposal says “At the onset, the Executive Fellow will look nationally at other police athletic leagues and develop recommendations and pilot programs that build on lessons learned from other promising initiatives. The Executive Fellow will also work side-by-side with community connectors, including the Bureau’s Community Resource Officers and Public Safety Councils to identify opportunities and assets that inform programming for each zone within the City of Pittsburgh.” <br>Finally, a FUSE fellow will work on creating an adult diversion program to provide residents with resources to keep them from entering the criminal justice system. The program will build upon successful efforts with the [Foundation of HOPE](https://www.foundationofhope.org/) to establish the HOPE Diversion Program targeted at youth ages 12-26 who commit low-level crime. <br>Under the program the FUSE fellow “will map out a one-year, short-term plan for implementing the program in at least two police zones.

| Office of Community Health and Safety Selected for National League of Cities Community Health Cohort | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 5, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Office of Community Health and Safety (OCHS), in partnership with Allegheny Health Network’s Center for Inclusion Health, has been selected to join the National League of Cities’ (NLC) [Cities of Opportunity](https://citiesofopportunity.nlc.org/about-us/about-cities-of-opportunity/) for [Cities and Health Systems Community of Practice](https://www.nlc.org/initiative/cities-and-health-systems-community-of-practice/#:~:text=and%20Spokane%2C%20Wash.-,The%20Cities%20of%20Opportunity%20Cities%20and%20Health%20Systems%20Community%20of,the%20Robert%20Wood%20Johnson%20Foundation.) cohort. The cohort provides an in-depth learning network led by NLC in partnership with the Center to Advance Community Health & Equity (CACHE) to foster and strengthen collaboration between municipal governments, health systems stakeholders and community partners to address root causes of poor health and advance equity in Pittsburgh.  <br>“We’d like to thank NLC and Cities of Opportunity for selecting the City of Pittsburgh for this cohort,” said Mayor William Peduto. “As a new city office, OCHS has the opportunity to bring a fresh perspective to the way the City and its health system partners deliver services and create real, sustainable change for the health and safety of our communities. We look forward to creating a model for Pittsburgh and the country for how we can work with our world-class health systems to leverage partnerships, work together, listen to the community and design our systems to respond to the root causes and real needs of residents with resources that help in both the immediate and long term.” <br>The Cities of Opportunity initiative helps local leaders address holistic, interconnected factors that affect residents’ health and safety and build resiliency in all communities. The City of Pittsburgh was among 22 municipalities from across the country selected to participate in Cities of Opportunity. Over the next several months, Pittsburgh will be working with nine other local governments specifically in the Cities and Health Systems Community of Practice cohort to assess and address structural, economic, policy and systemic barriers to health equity for marginalized communities. Pittsburgh was additionally selected within the cohort as one of two cities to receive additional support on this community health and safety initiative from the Public Health Institute. <br>The City of Pittsburgh was selected for the initiative due to the City’s demonstrated commitment to advancing programs, policies and practices that advance health equity in our community. Additionally, the City has a proven track record of bringing together various multi-sector stakeholders committed to improving the health and well-being of all Pittsburgh residents.  <br>OCHS plans to use this opportunity to work with cohort cities to grow the partnership model with the [Allegheny Health Network(AHN) Program for Homeless and Urban Poverty Medicine](https://www.ahn.org/services/medicine/center-for-inclusion-health/health-care-for-the-homeless.html). The model will identify opportunities for cities and health systems to improve health equity and community outcomes. The intention is to create a replicable partnership model to expand the initiative with other valuable health stakeholders citywide. <br>"The pandemic has exacerbated health and safety inequities in our communities, particularly related to the social determinants of health, trust in systems, accessibility of care, systemic racism and communication within systems and with the community,” said OCHS Manager Laura Drogowski. “We hope to learn from national leaders to be accountable and build a community-driven continuum of support. We believe in the critical mission and foundational work of the AHN Center for Inclusion Health and will focus on the expertise that is already in our community to continue to build our partnerships and better support residents.” <br>“As part of our ongoing partnership with the City of Pittsburgh to create innovative street outreach models that help mitigate risks posed by the compounding public health crises of homelessness, Allegheny Health Network is extremely pleased and honored to participate in this cohort. We look forward to demonstrating how local governments and health systems can work together to achieve health equity for vulnerable and marginalized populations,” said Dan Palka, Administrative Director, AHN Program for Homeless and Urban Poverty Medicine. <br>“The root causes of poor health, or the factors influencing how well we live and how long we live, lead to distinct inequities resulting in significant differences in the quality and length of life among residents across the country,” said Sue Polis, Director of Health and Wellness at the National League of Cities. “The National League of Cities is proud to work with the City of Pittsburgh in its efforts to turn this unprecedented time and its myriad of challenges into an opportunity to build a new, bright and more equitable future for all Pittsburgh residents.”  <br>The Cities of Opportunity Community of Practice began in January 2021 and will run through July 2021. The work is generously supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. | 5/2/2021 10:26:54 |
| Mayor Peduto Asks Governor Wolf to Immediately Vaccinate School Teachers | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 8, 2021) Mayor William Peduto issued a letter to Governor Tom Wolf today asking that the state Department of Health prioritize immunizations of teachers to expedite the safe return of all students to in-person schooling, and offered the City’s assistance with vaccinations. <br>The COVID-19 pandemic, the Mayor wrote, “has shined a light on the inequities of our society, and unfortunately, remote learning has exacerbated academic disparities for students and families of color. Promoting vaccines for teachers would help to speed up the safe return to school, would ensure that all students receive the focused academic support that they need to succeed, and would be aligned with your administration’s commitment to an equitable response to the pandemic.” <br>City recreation and senior centers are closed due to the pandemic so the Mayor offered them as vaccine distribution centers for teachers and others, and offered City staff to assist in working with local hospital and public safety officials. <br>The letter reads in full: <br>Dear Governor Wolf, <br>As our Commonwealth recovers from the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, I am writing to encourage you to take the necessary steps to ensure that teachers can be vaccinated immediately. This measure would help to create a safer environment for students, many of whom have fallen behind academically while attempting to shift to at-home learning, expedite the safe reopening of schools, and alleviate the concerns of teachers who are apprehensive about returning to unsafe conditions. The City of Pittsburgh stands ready to assist the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and other partners with the distribution of vaccines to educators in our community.   <br>The change to virtual learning has greatly impacted students and families, forcing them to scramble to secure the child care options, technology, and other supports needed to learn at home. This crisis has shined a light on the inequities of our society, and unfortunately, remote learning has exacerbated academic disparities for students and families of color. Promoting vaccines for teachers would help to speed up the safe return to school, would ensure that all students receive the focused academic support that they need to succeed, and would be aligned with your administration’s commitment to an equitable response to the pandemic.  <br>Even with school reopening guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prioritizing access to the vaccine for educators remains a critical tool to ensure that teachers feel genuinely safe in the classroom, students can learn successfully, and families feel comfortable returning their children to in-person learning environments. Teachers are most effective when they feel comfortable, and providing teachers with rapid access to vaccines would create a healthier setting for them and the students who learn from them. If your administration is willing to expedite the distribution of vaccines to educators, the City of Pittsburgh can provide staff support as needed, coordinate with local hospitals and public safety professionals, and offer our neighborhood recreation and senior centers as community-based vaccine distribution sites.  <br>Again, I encourage you to offer immediate access to vaccines for teachers. This action would promote the safe reopening of schools, reduce stress for parents and families, improve all students’ academic performance, and mitigate teachers’ apprehension about unsafe working conditions. The City is willing and able to assist your administration with this important endeavor. Thank you for your consideration and for your leadership throughout this global crisis. <br>Sincerely, <br>William Peduto <br>Mayor of Pittsburgh | 8/2/2021 12:36:19 |

| Despite Global Pandemic, Bond Rating Agencies Reaffirm City's Credit Rating | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 22, 2021) Two bond rating agencies reaffirmed the City of Pittsburgh’s AA- credit rating last week in advance of a $55 million bond issue, and praised the City’s management of its budget before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>The City’s fiscal planning and resiliency strategy over the past seven years turned a structurally deficient budget into a model of fiscal strength. The model’s success created a $120 million reserve fund that allowed the city to weather the COVID economic crisis. Today, the success of the city’s financial management is being recognized by two independent financial rating agencies, upholding the strong credit ratings that allows the city to borrow capital budget funds at a better rate to save taxpayers money.<br>S&P Global Ratings said the City’s financial outlook is stable and with an improving revenue environment said it could rebuild the reserves it used to offset budget losses during the pandemic. Fitch differed, saying it will be challenging to build up those reserves and said the financial outlook is negative due to budget unknowns this year.<br>[The S&P report issued February 18](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13191_Pittsburgh_Rating_Report_Final.PDF) said in part:<br>“Overall, we believe the financial progress made by Pittsburgh prior to the recent recession positioned the city well to absorb the negative effects of the pandemic while maintaining operations. Pittsburgh used reserves in 2020 to cover revenue losses and increased expenses without major service disruptions.<br>. . . Given an improving revenue environment and current federal aid proposals, combined with the city's commitment to make expenditure reductions if needed, we do not expect the city's finances will weaken significantly in 2021, and we believe reserves could even improve by year end.”<br>Fitch Ratings said this [in its February 18 report](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13190_Fitch_Rates_Pittsburgh,_PA's_GOs_'AA-'__Outlook_Negative.pdf):<br>“The 'AA-' GO ratings and IDR incorporate the city's very strong operating performance as evidenced by the recent buildup of a high reserve cushion and its significant independent legal ability to increase revenues. These strengths are offset to some degree by retiree benefit and other expenditure pressures that leave the city with just adequate ability to control spending and a pace of spending growth that will likely require ongoing budget management. . . The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's belief that the city may be challenged to rebuild reserves that are needed to offset near-term revenue declines sufficiently to maintain its high level of fundamental financial flexibility.”<br>In November [Mayor William Peduto proposed a $564 million operating budget](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4450) that did not include tax increases but warned that without federal aid to offset losses due to COVID-19 —including spending down its $120 million fund balance — the City would be forced to lay off more than 600 workers by July 1.<br>Congress is close to voting on a $1.9 million COVID-19 relief package proposed by President Biden that includes relief for state and local governments. | 22/2/2021 10:28:19 |

| The Hazelwood Greenway Stewardship Group Partners with the City of Pittsburgh to Receive $50,000 Grant from Trust for Public Land | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 22, 2021) Mayor William Peduto today announced a $50,000 investment from the Trust for Public Land to start up the Greenways Stewardship Program, which will be piloted in the 183-acre Hazelwood Greenway. This grant will support a partnership with the City of Pittsburgh and its commitment to the Trust’s 10 Minute Walk to Safe and Accessible Green Space Challenge. <br>"In Pittsburgh we proudly advocate for the preservation and growth of our public parks and open spaces. To date, 87% of Pittsburghers live within a 10-minute walk to a park in their neighborhood. I proudly support the ’10 Minute Walk to a Park’ campaign as we work towards our goal of providing all Pittsburghers access to equitable, economically thriving, safe, and healthy communities,” said Mayor William Peduto.<br>This initial investment for the Hazelwood Greenway will pilot a program for stewardship groups to access resources needed to create safe, high quality, natural community assets that also can withstand and provide protection from Pittsburgh’s changing climate. The Hazelwood Greenway Stewardship Group and the Hazelwood Initiative will work with the Department of City Planning and other City departments to engage the community to determine how to invest resources through a platform of support options, including those leveraging resources from City operations and staff.  <br>The project will add capacity to volunteer groups, allowing stewards to focus on the greenways instead of seeking funding and bearing administrative burdens. The City’s [Greenways 2.0 Plan](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2930__Community_Engagement_Toolkit.pdf) calls for financial investment in the system and the creation of a network of stewardship groups. The Greenways Stewardship Program will be replicable throughout the Greenways Network with demonstration of success and additional funding sources.  <br>The City developed the Greenway Network in 1980 as a tool to consolidate abandoned properties, mostly along steep hillsides, and establish a permanent conservation easement for public use. Volunteer stewardship groups maintain the 1,200-acre citywide system with little capital resources. The Trust for Public Land investment is a first of its kind for Pittsburgh’s Greenways. Overtime, the stewardship of these properties has become overwhelming, with persistent issues of dumping, invasive species, and poor ecological health and safety. The pilot project will identify ways to cultivate additional resources for greenways and build stronger connections between communities and nature. The ONEPGH Fund will administer the grant.<br>The first engagement session is planned for Hazelwood Initiative’s monthly Environmental Development meeting on Monday, February 22, 2021. Planning will take place throughout the winter and the groundwork will begin in the spring 2021. [Register here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYpceuorj8tHNF_F2sYbEXSSsXjBbm55ZyG) for the Environmental Development meetings.<br>**About The Trust for Public Land**<br>The Trust for Public Land creates parks and protects land for people, ensuring healthy, livable communities for generations to come.

| City Investing $800,000 in Public Art This Year, Will Be Seeking Artists for 18 Projects Citywide | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 24, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of City Planning Public Art and Civic Design (PACD) division announced there will be a series of calls for artists in 2021 to commission new public artwork as the City has dedicated over $800,000 for public art projects across 18 neighborhoods for the largest introduction of new public art in the city for decades. The projects are being funded through grants and percent for art funding as part of city projects, coming at no additional new cost.   <br>“We are excited to announce these upcoming opportunities to enhance public art throughout the city,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Not only will these projects support our artists, but they also provide an opportunity to creatively reflect the values, character and identity of our communities.”  <br>A significant portion of the funding is from a grant provided by the [Allegheny Regional Asset District](https://www.radworkshere.org/) (RAD) Art in Parks program as part of the RADical ImPAct Grant program, launched in honor of RAD’s 25th anniversary to fund bold, forward-looking, creative projects that will have a radical impact on the region.   <br>As part of the $500,000 RAD grant funding, the first call for artists will be seeking qualifications of individual artists or artist teams to create object-based sculpture or site-specific installations and landscape works in each of the city’s five RAD parks: Emerald View Park, Frick Park, Highland Park, Riverview Park, and Schenley Park. The City’s call for artists for the RAD Art in Parks was released on Wednesday, February 22, and bid submissions are due Tuesday, March 23, 2021. The request for proposals is available [here](https://webprocure.perfect.com/wp-web-public/#/bidboard/bid/86831?customerid=39).  <br>"The RADical ImPAct grant program was designed to allow our regional assets to dream big about the future of our creative landscape," said Rich Hudic, RAD Executive Director. "We are particularly excited about the Art in Parks program, which will bring large-scale works of public art into our regional parks. We look forward to this project bringing a renewed sense of vitality to our public spaces by making art a part of our everyday lives." <br>Subsequent calls for artists throughout the year will include “percent for art” projects in various City parks and municipal buildings as well as the Bus Rapid Transit project. Percent for art refers to the city’s [municipal ordinance](https://library.municode.com/pa/pittsburgh/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=COOR_TITONEAD_ARTIXBOCOAU_CH175ARCO_S175.08ORMUPRPLREAP) that stipulates that at least one percent of the amount for municipal construction or renovation of public buildings be reserved for the inclusion of works of art. PACD is coordinating these with the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) and Department of Public Works (DPW) and calls for artists will be issued throughout the year as projects reach the appropriate design development stage.   <br>The City of Pittsburgh currently maintains an inventory of nearly 200 public monuments, memorials and artworks. Public art humanizes our built environment, promotes social cohesion and understanding, supports our artists as contributors to economic growth and sustainability and creates meaning in the places where we live, work, and visit.   <br>The announcement comes as PACD recently completed a survey of 89 artists to gather feedback on how they hear about and participate in the City’s public art opportunities and how processes can be improved. After analyzing survey results, PACD and the Office of Management and Budget’s Procurement division will be hosting a series of virtual workshops to help inform artists on how to prepare, register and submit proposals through the City’s procurement platform [Beacon](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/bid-opportunities.html). The workshops will be held on Monday, March 8 from 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM, Monday, March 15 from 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM and Wednesday, March 17, 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM.

The third cohort will continue to be based in the [Gallery on Penn](https://www.facebook.com/GalleryonPenn/), Catapult’s dedicated retail incubation space on Penn Avenue in East Liberty. The Hill District cohort will be based in the new Gallery on Centre, located in the Centre Heldman Plaza. The Gallery on Centre is scheduled to open in the second quarter of 2021.<br>“We’re very excited about the Hill District cohort,” said URA Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker. “Many of these entrepreneurs have ties to the Hill and will now be supported to start or grow their business in their neighborhood.<br>“With the expansion of the Catapult program into the Centre Heldman Plaza, we are demonstrating how placed-based strategies can serve as wealth building tools for diverse businesses — which is a core component of Avenues of Hope,” said Walker. "The new Gallery on Centre will bring much needed investment to the neighborhood.”<br>Since the Catapult program began in early 2018:<br>- 100% of the participating businesses have been minority-owned; 80% are women-owned.<br>- 6 businesses from cohort 1 opened spaces in the Gallery on Penn.<br>- All of the cohort 2 businesses have participated in tabling events at the Gallery on Penn.<br>- An estimated 30 full- or part-time jobs have been retained or created.<br>- Cohort members have received more than 500 mentoring hours.<br>- Several businesses have sold their wares in other retail venues, including love, Pittsburgh; the Steel City Craft Emporium; and the I Made It! Market.<br>- 8 Catapult businesses have participated in the [Get Online and Grow Online](https://www.ura.org/pages/get-online-and-grow-online-program) program.<br>- One Catapult business was selected as a technical assistance provider for the Get Online and Grow Online program.<br>- 18 Catapult businesses are listed on [Gallery on Penn virtual site](https://www.ura.org/pages/gallery-on-penn).<br>“It's been a pleasure to work with the URA in developing and growing our Catapult: Startup to Storefront Program,” said Tammy T. Thompson, executive director, Catapult Greater Pittsburgh. “Having access to the intellectual resources that they've provided as well as the financial support has made a difference in how we have been able to develop, grow and implement this program. The URA’s consistent support over the last three years has been invaluable and a major impact on how we’ve been able to serve our community.<br>“We’re extremely proud of the opportunities that we've created through this program for primarily Black, women-owned businesses,” said Thompson. “We welcome the opportunity to expand the Gallery model into the Hill District, and we hope to work with many institutions within the Hill District to offer this opportunity to even more people.”<br>The URA will be highlighting the entrepreneurs in each cohort on its social media platforms and will follow along with the build out of the Gallery on Centre space once construction begins, leading up to the grand opening.

| City of Pittsburgh and Clearway Community Energy Announce Plans to Partner on District Energy | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12533_City_Logo.png)<br>City of Pittsburgh<br>Contact: Tim McNulty<br>Timothy.McNulty@pittsburghpa.gov<br>412-660-1999<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13243_Clearway_Logo.png)<br>Clearway Community Energy<br>Contact: Scott Barr<br>Scott.Barr@clearwayenergy.com<br>586-703-5153<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (February 25, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has signed a letter of intent to move forward with entering into a formal energy services agreement with Clearway Community Energy (Clearway), experts in district energy, combined heat and power, and microgrids. The letter of intent states that Clearway will work closely with the City to create a plan for transitioning it’s current steam service to Clearway’s new district heating system.<br>Currently, the City’s Downtown buildings are serviced by Pittsburgh Allegheny County Thermal (PACT), a customer-owned district heating company. “We look forward to continuing the tradition of safely providing reliable and cost-effective service to our customers,” said Ali Karvar, East Region General Manager of Clearway Community Energy. “We are strongly committed to supporting the Pittsburgh community and excited for the opportunity to partner with the City.”<br>“It is very important that Pittsburgh remain an enduring and adaptable city,” said Mayor William Peduto. “We recognize Clearway’s commitment to our community and feel confident about a smooth transition to their system. Most importantly, we are proud to be able to continue energy service that is both economical and environmentally-friendly.”<br>PACT has been in talks with Clearway about a potential transfer for a few years. Following a board meeting on November 19, 2020, the PACT board of directors announced their recommendation to move forward towards negotiating the execution of a development agreement with Clearway that will result in Clearway extending its district heating system into the Golden Triangle business district.<br>“Signing this letter of intent is the first step after years of planning with our partners to identify a long-term, cost effective, sustainable, and resilient district energy system for our operations in the City-County Building and greater Downtown,” Mayor Peduto continued. “This agreement builds on the recommendation from PACT, our current steam provider, and an evaluation of the impacts on emissions, climate, economic cost, and system reliability for a partnership with Clearway that will allow us to continue advancing our 2030 climate objectives in a safe and affordable way. We look forward to continuing to work with the Clearway team to prepare an energy services agreement to send to City Council.”<br>**About Clearway Community Energy**<br>Clearway Community Energy empowers local communities by safely providing resilient, sustainable energy solutions.

| Senator Fontana Partners with Mayor Peduto on Bill to Empower Pittsburgh Blight-Fighting Tool | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 1, 2021) State Sen. Wayne Fontana is partnering with Mayor William Peduto to introduce legislation to help the City of Pittsburgh land bank more efficiently acquire vacant and distressed properties and get them back onto the tax rolls. <br>Senator Fontana’s bill would allow the Pittsburgh land bank to acquire properties at sheriff’s sales at amounts equal to the outstanding claims and liens against the properties regardless of bids by other parties, similar to the powers granted to Philadelphia’s land bank. <br>“The current Treasurer's Sale process used by the city is often a selective, long, and faulty process. By amending the Municipal Claims and Tax Lien Law, it provides the City of Pittsburgh with another efficient and inexpensive option in acquiring vacant or distress properties in our communities,” Senator Fontana said. <br>The Pittsburgh land bank was created in 2014 following the adoption of state Act 153 of 2012, which allowed for community-based efforts to cut through red tape and acquire distressed and abandoned properties, and offer them to community groups and private entities seeking to revitalize neighborhoods. Since its creation, the land bank has been having difficulty clearing titles on properties and has only been able to fully acquire few properties. <br>“The land bank process, which once showed so much promise, has obviously been frustrating for Pittsburgh neighborhoods but Senator Fontana’s bill is what we need to finally turn it into the powerful, blight-fighting tool we expect it to be,” Mayor William Peduto said. “It would be a win-win-win for neighborhoods, housing advocates and city taxpayers.” <br>Last week Senator Fontana circulated a co-sponsorship memo on his proposed “Changes to the Municipal Claims and Tax Lien Law for Cities of the Second Class.” [The full memo](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&SPick=20210&cosponId=34830) reads as follows: <br>"Act 153 of 2012 provided Pennsylvania with a powerful tool for addressing blight and facilitating smart, community-based land recycling strategies.  Because of this law, many land banks were created including the Pittsburgh Land Bank in 2014.  While many land banks are thriving, my local land bank is struggling to succeed due to the difficulty in property acquisition.    <br>Currently, Pittsburgh utilizes the Second Class City Treasurer's Sale and Collection Act (“Treasurer’s Sale” or “T-Sale”), authorized by Real Estate Tax Sale Law (RETSL), for land recycling purposes. This does not result in a clean title until a separate quiet title action. For this reason I plan on introducing legislation that would amend the Municipal Claims and Tax Lien Law (MCTLL) that would grant Cities of the Second Class the ability to acquire property at sheriff’s sale by bidding an amount equal to the total amount of all municipal claims and liens regardless of bids by other parties.  This is currently the process the Philadelphia’s Lank Bank uses and it is believed that this would provide Pittsburgh land bank-type agencies a more efficient and inexpensive means of foreclosing municipal claims and tax liens in the city.    <br>Additionally my bill would automatically create a judgment when a lien or claim is filed; Provide that the tax foreclosure (sheriff’s sale) may be a free and clear sale; Provide for the City to object to a sale if the purchaser is debarred; Maintain the 3-month redemption period available to the City of Pittsburgh under the current Treasurer’s sale process; and Preserve the rights of a City of the Second Class may act as an agent for taxing bodies having claims against the property. <br>There are over 30,000 parcels that are vacant or distressed in the city of Pittsburgh resulting in over $4.8 million in loss tax revenue.  My legislation would give our local land bank and URA one more tool to assist in their land recycling efforts thus benefiting the area communities and potentially providing for additional tax revenue.” | 1/3/2021 10:16:03 |

| Mayor Peduto's Shade Tree Commission Introduce Equitable Street Tree Investment Strategy | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 2, 2021) - Mayor William Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh Shade Tree Commission have announced a new [Equitable Street Tree Investment Strategy](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13230_final_Equitable_Street_Tree_Investment_Strategy_-_2_24_21_-_apc.pdf) to promote maintenance in low-income neighborhoods with low tree canopy cover as part of Mayor Peduto’s vision to plant 100,000 trees over the next decade.  <br>The City currently uses data to inform focused street tree investment, but are seeking to improve this process by adding an equity lens. Benefits of trees include improved air quality, reduced stormwater runoff, reduced heat island effect, energy savings, increased sense of community, and biodiversity. According to census records and street tree inventory data funded by the Shade Tree Commission, visualizations by the Create Lab at Carnegie Mellon University show low-income and Black communities disproportionately have fewer city street trees and thus see less of the benefits of trees. The Equitable Street Tree Investment Strategy will help to ensure the benefits of street trees are distributed equitably.<br>The strategy seeks to identify 10 low-income and low-canopy neighborhoods annually for focused, proactive, and cyclical tree maintenance schedules, tree plantings, and urban forest education in those neighborhoods to improve the quality of life for current and future residents. Improved maintenance will include pruning, sidewalk repair, and stump removal and will be complemented by communication plans customized for each neighborhood.  <br>"The members of the Shade Tree Commission are pleased to be able to help find more dollars to build on the maintenance work our Department of Public Works Forestry Division does every day. Growing this capacity will allow for the benefits of trees, including improving air quality, to equitably reach more Pittsburgh neighbors," said Kristen Spirl, Shade Tree Commission Chair and Chatham University Arboretum Ground Manager. <br>The strategy outlines four phases to identify and address areas of need: <br>Phase 1: Analyze citywide data to identify neighborhoods needing investment and community partners to help with planting and maintenance needs.  <br>Phase 2: Approve Shade Tree Commission investments in 10 neighborhoods that define measures to incrementally improve visible maintenance, capacity, tree planting, education, and employment opportunities. <br>Phase 3: Evaluate tree canopy increases in selected neighborhoods.  <br>Phase 4: Identify the next 10 neighborhoods for investment to repeat the process and evaluation.  <br>"The Forestry Division already uses inventory and mapping data to inform where we focus maintenance of our urban forest, and the city collaborates with many partners to stretch what we are able to do," said City Forester Lisa Ceoffe. "The Equitable Street Tree Investment Strategy will take that work further and be able to build even better trust for Pittsburghers to request street trees in the first place." <br>The Equitable Street Tree Investment  Strategy was developed under the leadership of the Office of Mayor Peduto, the Shade Tree Commission, and the UrbanKind Institute in partnership with Tree Pittsburgh, Department of Public Works Forestry Division, Department of City Planning Sustainability and Resilience Division, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, and the Chatham University Arboretum.  <br>“We often hear the reluctance and weariness of residents to celebrate new tree plantings because they see damage to sidewalks and properties from earlier initiatives and are often responsible for care and maintenance that they are unprepared to provide,” said Jamil Bey, member of the Shade Tree Commission since 2015 and president of the UrbanKind Institute. “The Equitable Street Tree Investment Strategy acknowledges the community’s concerns and seeks to build trust by customizing communications and neighborhood invitations to participate. It will help the City be more effective with caring for trees in neighborhoods that have not seen much investment. As a member of the Shade Tree Commission, I am pleased to be part of contributing to this strategy for centering community voices in the pursuit of equity in city operations and duties." <br>Approved at the Shade Tree Commission’s regular January meeting, the strategy will be managed jointly by the commission and the City, who will work together to identify funding opportunities. Mayor Peduto and the Shade Tree Commission plan to announce the first phase of ten neighborhoods by Arbor Day on April 30th. <br>The Equitable Street Tree Investment Strategy and information about additional city tree initiatives are available on the [Shade Tree Commission’s website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/shade-tree/about-shade-tree). | 2/3/2021 10:04:28 |

The Mayor urged the Governor last month to swiftly vaccinate teachers, partially due to worries that at-home schooling was widening academic achievement gaps for students and families of color.  <br>“Governor Wolf’s wise decision to immediately vaccinate teachers will speed up the return of students to school, provide students the in-person attention they need after a full year away, and give teachers confidence that they can return to classrooms safely. The City of Pittsburgh stands ready to help the Commonwealth with this effort in any way it can,” Mayor Peduto said.  <br>“The vaccinations of our teachers and school staff will add additional layer to the mitigation strategies we have in place to welcome students back for hybrid learning. We are grateful for the advocacy of Mayor Peduto, who has consistently shared his voice to support the safe reopening of schools,” Superintendent Hamlet said.    <br>"On behalf of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, I would like to thank Governor Wolf for prioritizing vaccinations for teachers and school staff in Pittsburgh and across the state. The additional layer of protection that full vaccination will provide will make a meaningful and measurable difference in the lives of our educators, school staff, students and school communities," PFT President Nina Esposito-Visgitis said.<br>The Mayor’s February 8 letter on the subject [is available here](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%253A%252F%252Fpittsburghpa.gov%252Fpress-releases%252Fpress-releases%252F4679&data=04%257C01%257Cepugh1%2540pghschools.org%257C54cff1cb75ed4cd31b1808d8dda5aa34%257C8f711c9aec1c4dbbb790bb0c771b1dcc%257C0%257C1%257C637503050908836701%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%253D%257C3000&sdata=azIXaey41qePYm6ZzS69pdNtVYiFovT7y1dFS0%252BHcnY%253D&reserved=0).  <br>Today the Governor, along with the COVID-19 Vaccine Joint Task Force, announced teachers and school staff would be prioritized for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine as it becomes available. Vaccine distribution will occur in two phases – first for teachers and staff serving students in early grades K-5, serving students who receive special education or English language services in grades PreK-12, and elementary school bus drivers beginning next week. All other school staff would be included in a later distribution. The District will need to survey staff for AMI, who isthe group taking the lead on administering the vaccine for teachers across the state.<br>**Contacts:**<br>_Ebony Pugh_<br>_Director of Public Relations and Media Content_<br>_(412) 475-1523_<br>_epugh1@pghschools.org_<br>_Timothy McNulty_<br>_Communications Director_<br>_(412) 660-1999_<br>_timothy.mcnulty@pittsburghpa.gov_ | 3/3/2021 09:09:59 |

| The City of Pittsburgh Migrates to Google Cloud | PITTSBURGH, PA & SUNNYVALE, CA (March 8, 2021) – The City of Pittsburgh today announced a four-year agreement with Google Cloud to migrate its legacy IT infrastructure to Google Cloud. The agreement allows the city to not only lower its IT costs, but also improve delivery of citizen services and become the region's leader in cloud-native software development.  <br>Under the agreement, [the City of Pittsburgh Department of Innovation & Performance](https://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/) will transform and modernize its IT infrastructure onto Google Cloud. The city will then be able to build new data analytics tools to drive smart city initiatives, as well as create entirely new consumer-facing applications to deliver new digital services for its residents. As a result, the city will save costs, move off its brittle legacy IT structure, and ultimately create a cloud-based technology platform for the future. <br>“We were immediately impressed with the scalability and flexibility of Google Cloud after using the technology for an initial storage migration last year,” said Heidi Norman, acting director of the City of Pittsburgh Department of Innovation & Performance. “We realized all the different ways we could partner with Google Cloud to reduce the barriers of entry to move to a more cloud-focused approach to service delivery, and from there, developed a plan to rapidly adopt Google Cloud for our remaining on-premises applications. Ultimately, this migration will save city employees time and allow us to better deliver resident services.” <br>Through this migration, Pittsburgh will be able to leverage Google Cloud to quickly scale applications and other systems requirements as needed. Ultimately this will give the city's 19 departments the ability to create and scale services for residents to improve quality of life, including in the areas of mobility, transportation, infrastructure, public safety, and more based on the community's expressed needs. <br>City officials also chose Google Cloud for scalability and security, as both aspects were essential in powering applications across multiple departments simultaneously, as well as handling critical services in the Department of Public Safety, such as police, fire, and emergency medical services that rely on always-on technology to help save lives. <br>“We’re proud to partner with the City of Pittsburgh as part of its bold and transformative shift to the cloud,” said Mike Daniels, vice president, Global Public Sector, Google Cloud. “The city’s approach, powered by our technology, will open many opportunities to reimagine how to serve citizens, now and into the future.” <br>**About Google Cloud**<br>Google Cloud accelerates organizations’ ability to digitally transform their business with the best infrastructure, platform, industry solutions and expertise. We deliver enterprise-grade cloud solutions that leverage Google’s cutting-edge technology to help companies operate more efficiently and adapt to changing needs, giving customers a foundation for the future. Customers in more than 200 countries and territories turn to Google Cloud as their trusted partner to solve their most critical business problems. | 8/3/2021 08:52:49 |
| URA Initiatives in Crawford Roberts and Hazelwood to Support Neighborhood Stability and Home Ownership | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 9, 2021) New for-sale housing is planned to be built on vacant parcels owned by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh in Crawford Roberts and Hazelwood, moving the lots back onto tax rolls and incorporating affordable housing units. <br>The URA board is set to vote on plans from Bridging the Gap Development to build six for-sale townhomes on 12 URA parcels on Wylie Avenue, Roberts Street, Peach Street, Peach Way and Manilla Street in the Crawford Square Homes Redevelopment Area.  <br>Two of the houses are planned for households with incomes up to 80% Area Median Income (AMI). <br>“Building on these lots has long been a goal of the Crawford Square Home Owners Association, and I want to thank the developers and the URA for working together on this next phase of growth in this thriving neighborhood,” City Councilman Daniel Lavelle said. <br>In Hazelwood, the URA is set to enter exclusive negotiations with the City of Bridges Community Land Trust (CBCLT) for the sale of eight publicly owned parcels along Chatsworth and Hazelwood Avenues to build affordable housing units. <br>CBCLT plans to build 12 new, permanently affordable for-sale units available to households between 50% and 80% AMI.  <br>“This project will take vacant lots off an important corridor in Hazelwood, strengthen the residential character of the neighborhood, and allow lower-income residents to be a part of the rebirth of the community,” Councilman Corey O’Connor said. <br>The plans go before the URA board on Thursday. | 9/3/2021 13:51:35 |

| Mayor Peduto and URA Launch Affordable Home Ownership and Neighborhood Blight-Fighting Initiative | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 10, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh today announced the launch of OwnPGH, a bond-funded single-family home acquisition and rehab program, and provided updates on the Pittsburgh Land Bank and other tools that will support affordable home ownership and neighborhood blight-fighting tools citywide. <br>The centerpiece of OwnPGH is a $22 million bond issuance to finance a fund that will lower barriers to the acquisition of single-family homes throughout the City of Pittsburgh. The URA also plans a separate fund to help homebuyers cover rehabilitation costs. <br>At a press conference in Larimer, Mayor Peduto, Councilman Rev. Ricky Burgess, URA Executive Director Greg Flisram and Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker also announced organizational changes to improve the land acquisition efforts of the Pittsburgh Land Bank and a new initiative by the City Department of Finance to ease the acquisition of side yards.  <br>The press conference was held outside at a newly constructed affordable home on Mayflower Street by the URA’s Pittsburgh Housing Development Corporation (PHDC). It is near to five other affordable new construction units by the PHDC on the street, as well as up to three more being built next year on nearby Carver Street. <br>“Cumulatively these efforts of OwnPGH will not only get vacant homes and lots back onto tax rolls, but improve neighborhood quality of life and help Pittsburghers accomplish the dream of home ownership,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>The $22 million fund will offer competitive interest rates to interested borrowers wishing to acquire homes to serve as their primary residences. The bond debt will be repaid over the life of the mortgages as the borrowers repay their mortgages. <br>In addition, the URA plans to use $4 million of its existing Mortgage Revenue Bond Proceeds account to fund deferred second mortgages to help buyers finance home rehabilitation costs. Up to 20% of the property’s purchase price, or $40,000 per property, whichever is less, will be made available to borrowers in the form of a deferred second mortgage.  <br>The URA anticipates a summer bond issuance and late summer or early fall rollout of the program. The URA board is set to vote on the program Thursday. <br>At the Pittsburgh Land Bank (PLB) meeting Friday, Councilman Rev. Burgess, the board chairman, is set to announce that URA Deputy Executive Director Walker is assuming the position of PLB Executive Director and Greg Miller is becoming the PLB’s new manager. Miller, originally from southwestern Pennsylvania, is currently a Senior Urban Designer at the New York City Department of City Planning and will start in early April. <br>The leadership changes are part of URA efforts to provide more staffing and expertise to support the PLB’s mission.  <br>The changes are coming in tandem with a partnership between State Sen. Wayne Fontana and Mayor Peduto to help the land bank more efficiently acquire vacant and distressed properties and get them back onto the tax rolls. The Senator plans to introduce legislation that would make it easier for the PLB to acquire properties at sheriff’s sales at amounts equal to the outstanding claims and liens against the properties regardless of bids by other parties, similar to the powers granted to Philadelphia’s successful land bank. <br>Finally, OwnPGH includes a new effort by the Finance Department to make the purchase of vacant, city-owned side yards easier for homeowners.  <br>Currently, after a purchaser has applied to purchase a side yard and has been deemed an approved buyer, the City orders a title report on the property detailing its legal status, outstanding taxes and liens, and ownership history. Unfortunately, the process can take years to complete, as the City has a backlog of some 100 title reports stretching back three years. <br>The Finance Department now plans to tell purchasers to order their own title reports, which is already required of buyers of all other City properties, and should speed up the side yard process by giving interested buyers incentive to finish the title reports quickly and allow them to use the title vendor of their choice. | 10/3/2021 11:04:22 |

| URA Board Approves Sale of Centre Avenue Site For Relocation and Expansion of Big Tom's Barbershop | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 12, 2021) The URA Board of Directors has accepted the redevelopment proposal and approved the sale of 2178 Centre Avenue and three adjacent lots in the Hill District to Thomas Boyd for $21,000 plus costs to relocate and expand his business, Big Tom’s Barbershop. 2178 Centre Avenue is the former home to Hamm’s Barber Shop, an iconic building in the neighborhood. Mr. Boyd has operated Big Tom’s Barbershop in the Hill for 15 years.  <br>"This move brings back Walter Hamm’s legendary location on Centre Avenue and adds in Big Tom’s vision for the rebirth of the Hill," Mayor William Peduto said.  <br>At its February 2020 Regular Board Meeting, the URA authorized a period of Exclusive Negotiations for Thomas Boyd. Mr. Boyd’s barbershop business will relocate to the first floor of the rehabilitated Hamm’s structure, while the second and third floors will be renovated into 2 two-bedroom apartments, affordable at 50%-80% AMI. The adjacent lots will be used for outdoor deck space that could be utilized by the community or by neighborhood-based businesses. Neighborhood Allies awarded Mr. Boyd a $50,000 predevelopment grant that the URA matched with an additional $50,000. The total estimated development cost for this project is $1,316,283.   <br>“We are very excited about what this expansion signifies, not just for Tom but for the Centre Avenue corridor,” said URA Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker. “When we talk about Avenues of Hope, we are talking about working together to realize the community's vision by supporting and investing in local entrepreneurs and neighborhood-based economic development initiatives. Investing in projects like Big Tom’s Barbershop is how we are working to rebuild once thriving business districts and centers of Black culture and commerce, like the Hill District.” <br>In July 2019, the URA released an RFQ seeking multiple developers to purchase and redevelop any portion of 170 publicly-owned parcels along the [Centre Avenue Corridor](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ura.org%2Fpages%2Fcentre-avenue&data=04%7C01%7Ctimothy.mcnulty%40pittsburghpa.gov%7C99a9f7013c1d4e25d2f708d8e4aaa684%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C0%7C637510768896714646%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=fOKdJWvFeymKw8lbHmBMnT8G1%2ByGkNf8b6ri0AvMNck%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://www.ura.org/pages/centre-avenue. Click or tap if you trust this link.") in the Middle Hill neighborhood. The goal was to select developers to work to implement uses and further concepts articulated by the community as described in the 2015 Centre Avenue Corridor Redevelopment and Design Plan and the 2011 Greater Hill District Master Plan. Central to the plans are the following priorities:       <br>- Creating opportunities for minority and local developers;    <br>- Revitalizing Centre Avenue as the neighborhood’s primary retail, institutional, and cultural node as well as a strong residential neighborhood;    <br>- Building upon the African American cultural legacy;    <br>- Creating family-friendly housing without displacement;    <br>- Fostering economic empowerment; and    <br>- Producing comprehensive sustainability and quality design.   <br>On September 9, 2020, the URA held a community meeting in partnership with Council District 6, to present the Centre Avenue Round 1 RFQ proposals for community input. Mr. Boyd presented his proposal to the community and received an approval score of 100%.   <br>"We're just happy with all the efforts and we appreciate all the support from the URA, Councilman Lavelle, and all the people at Neighborhood Allies," Mr. Boyd said. "I want to push forward to get this development project going because I know it will do a lot to uplift the Hill District community and I'm thankful for the opportunity." | 12/3/2021 09:23:18 |
| Citiparks Distributes Half-Million Meals Since Start of Pandemic | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 12, 2021) One year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Parks & Recreation has reached a significant milestone with the distribution of a half-million free meals to eligible children and seniors. <br>Since March of 2020 Citiparks has distributed an estimated 423,600 Grab n Go meals to children and approximately 100,000 meals to seniors. <br>While Citiparks recreation and senior centers have been closed to activities during the pandemic, many have been repurposed as safe sites for food distribution to those in need. Many partners have helped with the food efforts, including Parkhurst Dining, Eat’n Park, the Salvation Army and many others, and their meal counts are not included in the 523,600 meals estimate. <br>"Though COVID has transformed our lives in unimaginable ways, the City and its Parks & Recreation Team have been able to provide over one-half million meals to children and seniors over these last 12 months. We could not have done this without the support of a multitude of community partners — almost too many to even list,” Citiparks Director Ross Chapman said. “I want to thank the Mayor and his Administration, my co-workers and colleagues, our partners and the residents of Pittsburgh for allowing us to provide direct and tangible support during this time of need." | 12/3/2021 11:37:43 |
| Friendship Community Group Seeks Artist for Asphalt Art Project | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 15, 2021) The Friendship Community Group has issued a request for proposals (RFP) for artists to complete a community-focused art installation at a five-way intersection in the Friendship neighborhood. The project, which includes additional street safety improvement designs in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), is being funded through an Asphalt Art Initiative grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  <br>The Asphalt Art Initiative is a new program from Bloomberg Philanthropies created to help cities use art and design to improve street safety, revitalize public spaces and engage their communities. The program not only seeks to create vibrant public spaces but also looks to build city capacity for working with artists and community groups on projects involving transportation infrastructure. <br>This project will enhance the five-way intersection near the FCG-owned and programmed Baum Grove Parklet, at Harriet, South Fairmont, and Roup Avenues in the Friendship neighborhood of Pittsburgh, through asphalt paintings in the newly designed pedestrian plazas and activated curb extensions. Feedback from the surrounding neighbors, community members, neighborhood organization, and art community will help inform the asphalt art design and help with project installation. <br>“It is an honor to be selected for the Bloomberg Philanthropies’ inaugural Asphalt Art grant. Working with our partners at DOMI and the City of Pittsburgh, along with the talented teams at Bloomberg and Street Plans, we have a redesigned intersection streetscape that will improve the safety of a confusing intersection while creating a beautiful work of art on the new pedestrian plazas. The Friendship Community is a strong collection of diverse neighbors with a history of community engagement and inclusive processes. We are excited to bring the art to our streets. We look forward to being inspired by the new art that encompasses what Friendship values: Friendship, Unity, Hope, Nature, and Harmony” states Sara DeLucia, President of Friendship Community Group. <br>The goals of the project are to improve safety and the pedestrian experience through slower traffic speeds, shorter crossing distances and enhanced vibrancy and beautification. The asphalt art will be the foundation of the improvements that will extend on all portions of the large intersection. Data collection before and after the project will measure the impacts of these improvements. <br>Project engagement began in the Autumn of 2020 with the goal to install the art in Summer 2021. The Friendship Community Group is managing the RFP and it can be found [here](https://www.friendship-pgh.org/asphalt-art). Applications are due April 12th and an artist or artist collective will be chosen by April 20th. <br>For additional information, about the Asphalt Art Initiative, visit [Bloomberg Philanthropies](https://www.bloomberg.org/arts/supporting-public-art/asphalt-art-initiative/). | 15/3/2021 11:10:08 |
| Mayor Peduto Joins Support for Citizenship through American Dream and Promise Act | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 15, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and others in the U.S. Conference of Mayors are pledging support for legislation easing the pathway to citizenship for those who have lived in the country since they were children. <br>[H.R. 6](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6)  is the American Dream and Promise Act. It would allow Dreamers — those who have lived in the United States since childhood and have built their lives in the country — to earn lawful and permanent citizenship if they meet certain criteria. <br>“Pittsburgh was built on the shoulders of those who settled here seeking to build a new future for themselves and their families. We should embrace those searching for a legal means for becoming U.S. residents, and welcome them to become Americans,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>The support letter from USCOM is below. <br>Dear Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: <br>We write on behalf of the nation’s mayors to urge you to quickly pass H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act.  This legislation would enable Dreamers – people who have lived in America since they were children and built their lives here – to earn lawful permanent residence and eventually American citizenship if they meet certain criteria.  We pledge to work with you in this effort and to do whatever we can to assist you in seeing it enacted into law. <br>The United States Conference of Mayors has had strong policy supporting permanent legal status for Dreamers and extension of the DACA program for many years.  Our bipartisan organization has adopted this policy because it is the right thing to do – for Dreamers, for our communities and for our country.  The cultural, economic, and social contributions of the 800,000 DACA recipients and their families to their communities cannot be overstated; particularly during a global pandemic where over 200,000 DACA recipients are working in essential roles including 27,000 in health care positions. <br>In 2019 the Conference adopted policy specifically “calling on Congress to pass H.R. 6 the American Dream and Promise Act to ensure that Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients continue to live in, contribute to and ensure the prosperity of the cities they call home.”  Dreamers and TPS and DED beneficiaries are longtime residents who call the United States home. The average TPS holder has been here for 22 years, and the average DACA recipient came at age 6. <br>Many Dreamers and TPS and DED holders are essential workers, working on the frontline to fight the Covid pandemic and helping to save lives. The time for Congress to act is now. | 15/3/2021 11:06:52 |

| Award Winning Rec2Tech Program Expanding Offerings to Pittsburgh Youth | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 16, 2021) Rec2Tech classes from the Department of Parks & Recreation continued virtually through the last year, and will continue to expand with new classes in computer coding this spring. <br>Introduced by Mayor William Peduto and led by Citiparks’ Digital Inclusion Coordinator Max Dennison, the tech classes for youth seek to bridge the digital divide by providing free STEM instruction at City recreation centers. As the rec centers have been closed since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 Dennison moved the classes online, serving more than 100 students in all. <br>“Max is one of the City of Pittsburgh’s finest ambassadors, and the training and opportunities he is giving City youth will pay off for years to come,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>“With the direct support of Mayor Peduto and his Administration, the National Science Foundation / Digital Harbor Foundation, and other generous area supporters, the City of Pittsburgh is now better positioned to offer tech-based programs and activities that many city youth have had very limited exposure to,” Citiparks Director Ross Chapman said. <br>“In addition to the dynamic recreational activities that we offer, my hope is that Citiparks' Recreation Centers will be able to be viewed more as learning hubs. The goal is to deliver impactful programs that are designed to help address the digital divide, while also provide more equitable and inclusive avenues to resources and enrichment. Max's experience, knowledge and commitment are helping us rethink our approach to more formal learning in less formal settings, and we're all very excited to see where we can take this in the next few years." <br>In 2019-2020 Rec2Tech provided in-person and virtual trainings including: <br>- Paulson (Summer 2019), 12 student cohort  <br>- Phillips AI Bootcamp (Oct/Nov 2019), four 2 hour classes 12 students  <br>- Warrington (Fall/Winter 2019), 10 students  <br>- Coding Camp (Summer 2020) — in conjunction with Citicamp@Home, 40 students served. <br>- Coding Camp 2 (Summer 2020 – in conjunction with Citicamp@Home, 40 students served.  <br>- Holiday Coding Class (January 1, 2021), 10 students served  <br>- Black History Month Coding Cohort (February 22, 2021), 10 students served. <br>The following initiatives are being offered this year: <br>**2021 Coding Cohorts**: Citiparks will continue to offer virtual and when able in-person coding classes for both beginner and intermediate level participants.

| City of Pittsburgh to Launch Phase 2 of Blue Recycling Bin Distribution in May | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 16, 2021) Mayor William Peduto today announced a May launch of the second phase of the Department of Public Works Environmental Services’ distribution of 32-gallon blue curbside recycling bins to City residents as part of a transition away from a bag-based recycling program into a bin-based collection method.<br>Over a two-year period, the City of Pittsburgh is distributing over 100,000 blue recycling bins to all single family homes, duplexes and apartment buildings with five or fewer units with a goal of becoming BAG FREE BY ’23.<br>The Blue Bin Rollout program, which began in Fall 2020, has delivered bins to 5,500 residents of East Liberty, Friendship, Garfield, Highland Park and Lower Polish Hill. The second and third phases, taking place in Spring and Summer 2021, will serve approximately 50,000 homes in remaining central and eastern neighborhoods. Residents of southern, western and northern neighborhoods will receive bins in 2022.<br>“The City of Pittsburgh is now offering residents a method that makes it easy for people to create the habit of single-stream recycling, which allows residents to combine all recyclable materials in one container,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Blue bins offer many advantages such as saving on costs for both residents and the City, providing high-value recyclables to the circular economy and cutting contamination.”<br>Prior to receiving the new recycling bins, residents will receive notification via U.S. Mail announcing when to anticipate the arrival of their new blue curbside recycling containers, along with information on what can and cannot be placed in the bin.<br>Rehrig Pacific Company – which is manufacturing the bins in Pennsylvania – will deliver a 32-gallon blue recycling bin with tight-fitting lid to each designated residence. Each bin will come with an information packet describing its proper use, and each bin will be scanned and linked to a specific address. Up to two 18-gallon totes are available as an alternative for medical exemption. Qualifying individuals must contact 311 City Response Center to request totes.<br>When using the blue bins, residents must loosely place recyclables in the bins without plastic bags, which can jam up equipment at processing facilities. Residents can deposit into the bins glass and plastic bottles, jugs and jars (lids removed), aluminum and steel cans, and mixed paper. Clean cardboard must be flattened, boxed and placed next to the bin.<br>“Education is a key component of successfully transitioning to the bag-free collection system, and we’re excited to offer a variety of opportunities for residents to learn more about what goes in the bin and what does not,” said Teresa Bradley, Pittsburgh’s recycling supervisor. “While many people think they’re recycling correctly, they’re actually tossing in plastic containers – such as yogurt tubs, K-cups and take-out clamshells – that do not belong in a blue bin.  Plus there’s the issue of how you can responsibly dispose of scrap metal, tires, yard debris, household chemicals and e-waste, so we want to make sure residents have an opportunity to learn to recycle correctly.”<br>Residents can learn to recycle correctly by taking part in a series of free online workshops beginning in late March. The 30-minute webinar, presented by the Pennsylvania Resources Council, will spotlight bin use as well as options for recycling hard-to-recycle materials. Individuals can register for a webinar at [www.pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/recycling-blue-bins](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/recycling-blue-bins).<br>Webinars will take place: Sunday, March 21, at 2:00 p.m.; Wednesday, March 24, at 6:30 p.m.; Tuesday, April 6, at 6:30 p.m.; Saturday, April 10, at 10:30 a.m.; Wednesday, April 14, at 6:30 p.m.; Tuesday, April 20, at 6:30 p.m.; Saturday, April 24, at 10:30 a.m.; Monday, May 3, at 6:30 p.m.; and Monday, May 10, at 6:30 p.m. A Spanish language webinar will take place Wednesday, April 28, at 6:30 p.m.<br>Pop-up events taking place in the spring will provide several in-person opportunities to learn more.<br>Funding for the Blue Bin Rollout is provided in part by grants from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, The Recycling Partnership and the Mayor's commitment to move the City toward zero waste. The distribution plan is based on multiple factors: available funds, Bureau of Environmental Services' recycling routes, recycling participation surveys and technical assistance provided by The Recycling Partnership.<br>“Pittsburgh is adapting to a stronger culture of waste reduction and material reuse, and blue bin recycling will make that culture change more accessible and equitable for all residents,” said Mayor Peduto. <br>Residents can learn more about the Blue Bin Rollout program at 311 City Response Center, Twitter @PGH311, [PGH.ST](http://pgh.st/) and [www.pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/recycling-blue-bins](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/recycling-blue-bins). | 16/3/2021 09:52:55 |

| Sustainability and Resilience Division Details 2020 Successes | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 22, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Division of Sustainability and Resilience reported a number of successful steps on behalf of the environment in 2020 on topics as varied as fossil fuel disinvestment, electric vehicles, building efficiency and food security. <br>“The City of Pittsburgh is making real and verifiable steps toward meeting our climate goals, and when they are added to the work of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and others worldwide it proves that cities are leading the way in the fight against climate change,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>"We are proud of the work of our team and partnerships with all of the city departments. These results are a demonstration that sustainability is everyone's responsibility in an organization,” said Chief Resilience Officer Grant Ervin. <br>“Over the last year, even under the duress of the pandemic, we are seeing the implementation of the City's Climate Action Plan being activated all corners of city government.

| Pittsburgh Police Win State Grant to Support Youth Outreach Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 23, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has won a state grant to boost efforts to work with city youth to reduce violence. <br>The Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency awarded the Bureau a $126,718 [Community Violence grant](https://www.pccd.pa.gov/AboutUs/Pages/Press%20Releases/School-Safety-and-Security-Committee-Approves-$7-5-Million-in-Community-Violence-Grants.aspx) to fund officer participation in Youth Connections programming, develop and train Youth Advisory Council members, and provide implicit bias training to teachers and staff at local schools. <br>Youth Connections (YC) is a program Pittsburgh Police designed to build relationships between Pittsburgh youth and police officers in City communities. <br>Through the program officers meet monthly with 9th grade students at Pittsburgh Public Schools, where they engage in mentoring, conduct lessons about the rights and responsibilities of young people during police interactions, engage in conversations about negative or positive police experiences, discuss stereotypes associated with each group, and engage in reverse role-play scenarios where the youth assume the role of the police officer in reality-based scenarios. <br>“Youth Connections is among the most important outreach programs Pittsburgh Police have right now, and is making a real difference in improving community relations and sparking interest in the Public Safety Academy at Westinghouse High School,” Mayor William Peduto said. “I want to thank PCCD for this grant, as well as the students and Police Bureau officials participating in the program.” <br>“PBP is so honored to receive PCCD grant monies to support efforts at building relationships with Pittsburgh youth,” says Community Engagement Officer Sergeant Tiffany Costa. “Youth Connections is a powerful way to establish bonds between youth and officers in a neutral environment that is conducive to hearing each other and building trust.” <br>The grant funds will pay for wages for patrol officers who attend Youth Connections programming while not on duty, meals at Youth Connections mentor-focused sessions, and a consultant fee for 5A Elite, which is the nonprofit that trains youth leaders who have graduations from YC session to join its Youth Advisory Council. | 23/3/2021 14:18:03 |
| Pittsburgh Financial Empowerment Center Saves Clients Millions in Savings and Debt | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 23, 2021) The Pittsburgh Financial Empowerment Center (FEC) has provided direct personal financial management support to 868 people since the City of Pittsburgh and Neighborhood Allies launched the program in March 2019, leading to nearly $1.3 million in total debt reduction and $1 million in increased savings. <br>[The Pittsburgh FEC](https://pittsburghpa.gov/fec/) offers free professional one-on-one financial counseling for individuals and families looking to address their financial challenges and plan for their futures. Any area resident over the age of 18 can register to meet regularly with an accredited financial counselor — by phone or video during the pandemic — who will help them define and reach their own financial goals.   <br>“Working with the FEC gave us a clearer picture of our finances and alleviated the stress of not being able to pay down our debt. We now have the confidence to be accountable to handle our debt with their tools and expertise,” one FEC client said. “Our FEC office has an amazing supportive staff that continues to point us in the right direction.” <br>Henry Horn Pyatt, Economic Opportunity Manager for the City of Pittsburgh, said "We know that one of the most pernicious aspects of structural inequity is that it gets worse from generation to generation as folks don't have wealth and experience managing it to pass on to the next generation, and so that generation starts off behind their peers, and the cycle continues.  With an FEC counselor, clients can tap into expert level financial advice, and be connected with tools like income supports and business capital, that help make meaningful strides toward ending the "ratchet" effect of generational economic inequity." <br>The latest figures from the FEC show: <br>- Total Debt Reduction (all clients): -$1,263,673 <br>- Total Savings Increase (all clients): $1,001,041 <br>- Average Debt Reduction per Client: 243 clients reduced debt by an average of $5,200 <br>- Average savings increase per client: 256 clients increased saving by an average of almost $3,928 <br>Other figures show: <br>- Clients are 47.5% Black, 35% White, 17.5% other or multiple races <br>- 85% of client households are below AMI <br>- 64% of client households have an income of less than $35k/yr <br>Pittsburgh FEC has been nationally recognized for its COVID-19 response in quickly migrating their services to phone and video and having counselors specially trained in federal and state COVID-19-specific assistance programs. In May, they received a grant from the [Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund](https://cfefund.org/) to hire an additional counselor to assist in the COVID-19 emergency response to Pittsburgh residents’ financial hardships. Pittsburgh FEC was recently highlighted for its leadership in financial counseling assistance in the [Bloomberg Cities SPARK](https://medium.com/@BloombergCities/how-virtual-financial-counseling-is-boosting-peoples-bottom-line-242eebd15e65) newsletter. <br>Pittsburgh FEC is a free public service provided in partnership between the City of Pittsburgh Mayor’s Office of Equity, Neighborhood Allies, Advantage Credit Counseling Service, and Cities for Financial Empowerment.

| City of Pittsburgh to Revamp Recruitment of Minority and Women Firefighters | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 30, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh will introduce improvements to boost recruitment of qualified women and minorities to be firefighters through the recommendations of a year-long Firefighter Barrier Assessment study.<br>Of the Fire Bureau’s 474 firefighters, five are women and 53 are minorities.<br>After talks between Mayor William Peduto and International Association of Fire Fighters Local No. 1, the Department of Human Resources and Civil Service (HRCS) contracted with the National Testing Network in late 2019 to study ways to increase diversity within the Bureau of Fire, and it was submitted to the City late last year. After further discussions among HRCS, the Department of Public Safety, the Fire Bureau and IAFF new recruitment methods are ready to be introduced.<br>“All of our Public Safety bureaus strive to reflect the make up of the communities they serve,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “In Pittsburgh, the population consists of 52% women and 28% minorities, yet the number of applications to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire does not currently mirror those numbers. The City is committed to attracting a more diverse workforce to choose a rewarding career with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. This way we will better understand and communicate with our neighbors, keeping us all safe.”<br>“A fire department is stronger when it understands its community and reflects the diversity of the community,” said Ralph Sicuro, President of the Pittsburgh Fire Fights, IAFF Local No. 1. “We will provide a higher level of service to our communities with a diverse organization because different viewpoints are embraced and effective making a healthier, more functional, more innovative and creative department. Understanding leads to safety.”<br>Recommendations for the improved recruitment of qualified minority and women candidates to be Pittsburgh firefighters included:<br>- Update the written exam to one that is more modern, has less group differences, and is appropriate for rank order use. Using written exams to rank order requires evaluating the impact within the upper scores on the test to ensure the barrier is not present.<br>- Change the physical test to the Candidate Physical Abilities Test (CPAT) and use it as a pass/fail exam that does not have a weighted score. While the CPAT is the likely choice because it is a national standard, there are other validated options that are less costly.<br>- Provide more candidate convenience in the hiring process. Allow candidates to test and/or submit applications for a longer period of time, including having more testing times and locations. The more the better. Also, provide opportunities to submit applications electronically.<br>- Recruitment will have a larger impact once barriers are reduced. A broad candidate pool can help increase both the quality and diversity of candidates. However, process barriers will work against the positive impact of a large candidate pool.<br>The City has already adopted some measures recommended by the study from youth recruitment (at the Public Safety Academy at PPS Westinghouse, and a youth camp for girls); a new written exam; and the ability to submit applications electronically.<br>**A correction has been made. It was previously reported that there were three women in the Fire Bureau. It has been updated to the correct number of five women.** | 30/3/2021 10:31:30 |

Dr. Howard B. Slaughter, Jr., President & CEO of Habitat Pittsburgh and U.S. Navy and U.S. Army Reserve Veteran, said, “Habitat Pittsburgh's collaborative partnership with the City of Pittsburgh is the catalyst for increasing an essential path to homeownership and economic stability for Veterans in need of quality affordable homeownership.”  <br>Habitat Pittsburgh purchased several properties in Larimer for the Veterans Homeownership Initiative, and this is the second home that has been completed and will be sold to a veteran family in the neighborhood. This marks the 105th property completed as part of Habitat Pittsburgh’s premier Homeownership Program, which has included homes in Garfield, East Liberty, Homewood the Hill District and other municipalities throughout Allegheny County.

| City Breaks Ground for New State-of-the-Art DPW 4th Division Facility | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 1, 2021) Today the City of Pittsburgh broke ground for a new, state-of the-art Department of Public Works (DPW) facility in the Knoxville neighborhood. The new facility will replace the former DPW Division 4 building on the same site on Bausman Street.  <br>The DPW Division 4 building was previously a bakery prior to the City acquiring it in 1971. The building housed DPW operations staff and equipment that primarily serviced Hilltop and southern neighborhoods. It was closed in 2017 after a structural engineering report found the facilities were unsafe for both workers and machinery. It was demolished in 2018. <br>The new DPW facility will be built from the ground up for today’s modern workforce. It will be energy efficient and outfitted with current technology standards to support workers in their duties, allowing them to more easily plan and coordinate their work in conjunction with other DPW divisions and city departments. DPW intends to use the facility as a model standard for all DPW division buildings moving forward.  <br>“We are pleased to be breaking ground on this brand new building for the 4th Division,” Mayor William Peduto said. “Providing public works services is one of the most important roles the city performs. This state-of-the-art facility will help our crews improve efficiency in delivering services for our residents while also providing a high quality workplace for our employees.” <br>"This could not have happened without the support of Mayor Peduto and his unwavering commitment to delivering core city services to our southwest neighborhoods,” said Councilman Bruce Kraus.  <br>"I am thrilled to work with my colleagues and the Mayor to bring forth the announcement of the re-building of our 4th Division Public Works facility,” said Councilman Anthony Coghill. “By re-opening this division, the city can assure that the hard working men and women of the 4th Division can provide coverage for our residents' basic needs in District 4. A special thanks to Chief of Staff Dan Gilman, Councilman Bruce Kraus and Councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith for the unwavering support and efforts on behalf of the people of my district." <br>Mayor Peduto and the City Councilmembers were joined today by Acting DPW Director Chris Hornstein and Supervisor Jeff Koch.<br>The project is currently budgeted for $3.2 million in capital funding and construction is expected to begin in August. | 1/4/2021 11:14:37 |

| Free Mulch From Recycled Christmas Trees Available Starting Saturday | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 5, 2021) Pittsburgh residents are welcome to pick up free mulch from the City's [Christmas Tree Recycling Program](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4569), starting this Saturday. <br>This past holiday season, the City of Pittsburgh diverted more than 2,200 Christmas trees and 38 tons from the landfill over the course of one month. With the help of the Department of Public Works Environmental Services bureau and its Forestry Division, Pittsburgh residents took Christmas trees to five locations throughout the City for recycling. The trees were then chipped into mulch at the zoo drop-off location or composted by Wood Waste Recycling. In addition, organic material from the Forestry division, year round drop-off centers and bi-annual composting events will be made available to the public in the expanded month-long program as well.  <br>Residents interested in picking up mulch for their spring gardens can do so at the locations listed below. Users must bring their own buckets, gloves, and shovels. In addition, face masks or coverings must be worn, and social distancing guidelines followed.  <br>**Dates**: April 10th through May 10th (or until supplies last!) <br>Locations below are open seven days a week, from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.  <br>- Riverview Park- Directly past the division salt dome building <br>- Moore Park - Lower Moore parking lot <br>- Sheraden Park - Take Surban St into the park, at first parking lot.  <br>- The Zoo Overflow Parking Lot - 7370 Baker Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15206 parking area to the right. (pine mulch only) <br>- Highland Park - Across from the dog park  <br>Locations below are open Monday through Saturday, 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. <br>- 5th Division of Public Works <br>- 1330 Hassler St. Pittsburgh, PA 15220  (Off Herschel St. & Steuben St. near Herschel Park)    <br>- 2nd Division of Public Works <br>- 6814 Hamilton Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15208 (North Dallas Ave. at Hamilton Ave.)   <br>- 3rd Division of Public Works <br>- 40 Melanchton St Pittsburgh, PA 15207 (Off 2nd Ave around the corner from the division gate on Dyke St) <br>Pine mulch featured at the zoo location is great for vegetable gardens, blueberries, strawberry patches, tomatoes, and eradicating weeds. All other locations will feature a high grade triple-shred mulch that works well when planting new saplings, perennial gardens or young sprouts since the fine hardwood mulch adds vital nutrients to the growing plants. | 5/4/2021 09:38:25 |
| City of Pittsburgh Offering Free Pediatric First Aid, CPR and Fire Safety Certifications for Childcare Providers | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 6, 2021) Mayor William Peduto announced today that the City of Pittsburgh will host a free training program for childcare providers to receive state-required pediatric first aid, CPR and fire safety certifications. Biennial certifications are critical to ensuring the safety of children and staff, but can be expensive for childcare facilities who often operate with limited funding and resources. This free course helps to alleviate that cost for the city’s childcare facilities, while allowing them to maintain a high standard of safety.  <br>“It can be very difficult and costly for childcare facilities to ensure that their staff members have access to high quality training opportunities. Our program aims to ensure that programs that need this vital training are able to get it and to keep the children in their care safe,” said Tiffini Simoneaux, Youth and Education Manager for the Office of Equity. <br>Due to safety precautions, the program will be offered in a hybrid format with participants at two physical locations following strict COVID-19 protocols. Virtual video instruction by Pittsburgh paramedics and the Fire Prevention Officer will be broadcast live to training locations. University of Pittsburgh Student EMS monitors will be at each location to verify certifications for participants.  <br>“Bystanders are often the first people on scene of a medical emergency. Providing first aid and CPR training to childcare providers will allow for high quality bystander care to be rendered prior to the arrival of emergency medical personnel and will improve patient outcomes. Pittsburgh EMS is proud to safely provide this training and encourages everyone to learn CPR,” Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Assistant Chief Pinchalk said.   <br>Fire Prevention Officer Lisa Epps-Cuda added that, “Fire safety is a necessary part of emergency preparedness and every family and business must have a fire safety plan in place. Childcare facilities are no exception. I am looking forward to sharing this information with childcare providers throughout the City of Pittsburgh to make sure that in the event of an emergency, these facilities know exactly what to do and how to stay safe.” <br>Upon completion of this course, each participant will receive an American Heart Association Heartsaver Pediatric First Aid and CPR/AED certification, as well as a Fire Safety certificate at no cost.  <br>The all-day training will be hosted by the Office of Equity, Bureau of EMS and Bureau of Fire in partnership with Trying Together and the Early Learning Resource Center Region 5. Trainings will be held on Saturday, April 10 at 10:00 a.m. Registration is required and space is limited. Childcare staff and early learning professionals who work or reside in the City of Pittsburgh are eligible to participate in this program and can sign up [here](https://tryingtogether.org/event/pediatric-cpr-first-aid/). | 6/4/2021 11:47:20 |

| Pittsburgh Files Brief in Support of Philadelphia Challenge of State Gun Preemption Laws | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 6, 2021) Lawyers for the City of Pittsburgh and Everytown Law have filed a brief in support of [the lawsuit Philadelphia filed last year](https://www.phila.gov/2020-10-07-amid-rising-gun-violence-city-officials-announce-major-legal-action-against-commonwealth-over-preemption-of-gun-safety-laws/) challenging the Pennsylvania General Assembly for blocking cities from enforcing common sense gun safety policies. <br>Pittsburgh and Everytown filed their amicus brief with Commonwealth Court yesterday.  <br>Pittsburgh, the brief says, “is no stranger to the gun violence epidemic that plagues this Commonwealth’s cities. Pittsburgh is also— unfortunately—no stranger to ways in which the Pennsylvania General Assembly perpetuates the epidemic. Were it not for the General Assembly’s actions (and inaction), Pittsburgh’s residents, including individual Petitioners in this lawsuit, would be safer today.” <br>The brief argues that due to the General Assembly preventing cities from enforcing their own gun safety laws city residents — particularly those of color — are regularly harmed by gun violence. Pittsburgh government itself is harmed when reasonable laws and regulations it approves to protect its residents are blocked by state laws. <br>Everytown Law, the litigation arm of the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, is leading the defense of gun safety laws the City of Pittsburgh approved in 2019 after the Tree of Life massacre. The case remains before Commonwealth Court. <br>A copy of the brief filed yesterday [is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13807_2021.04.5_Pitt_Amicus_(final).pdf). | 6/4/2021 12:07:28 |

| Affordable Housing in East Hills Set for Renovations and Sale | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 8, 2021) More than 30 properties in East Hills will be stabilized under plans going before the board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh today in an agreement with Rising Tide Partners. <br>Rising Tide plans to acquire and stabilize 30 vacant properties in the East Hills Park community, and acquire four occupied rental units and one vacant rental unit that will be renovated and sold as affordable housing to buyers between 50-60% Area Median Income (AMI) within five years. <br>As the URA board agenda notes, the East Hills Park Revitalization Strategy Report released in December 2020 shows that more than 50% of the homes in East Hills Park require significant repairs. The report found that 32 of the 167 townhomes are vacant and only 37% are owner-occupied.  <br>By implementing a revitalization strategy that acquires and stabilizes the most troubled units of East Hills Park and removes the nearly 700 liens that encumber the properties, the remaining units have increased likelihood of being sustained as naturally affordable owner-occupied housing and can continue to meet the needs of low-income homeowners. <br>In support of the initiative the URA board is set to vote today on a $400,000 UDAG Program Income Fund (UPIF) Loan and a $81,000 Pittsburgh Housing Construction Fund Loan. | 8/4/2021 11:26:39 |

| Governor Wolf Awards Funding to Big Tom's Barbershop in the Hill District | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 8, 2021) Governor Tom Wolf [today awarded $500,000](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-announces-2-2-million-for-community-revitalization/) for the rehabilitation of what will become Big Tom’s Barbershop and two affordable housing units in the Hill District, at the site of the iconic Hamm’s Barber Shop on Centre Avenue. <br>Owner Thomas Boyd plans to relocate to the first floor of the rehabilitated Hamm’s structure, while the second and third floors will be renovated into 2 two-bedroom apartments, affordable at 50%-80% Area Median Income (AMI). <br>The Governor’s funding — approved today by the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency — came from the sale of tax credits under the Mixed-Use Development Tax Credit Program, the proceeds of which are being used to fund the work of the Community Revitalization Fund Program. <br>The overall project cost is $1.3 million, and the Governor’s $500,000 follows awards of $50,000 each from Neighborhood Allies and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh.  <br>The Big Tom’s project arose from a RFQ the URA released in July 2019 seeking multiple developers to purchase and redevelop any portion of 170 publicly owned parcels along the Centre Avenue Corridor in the Middle Hill neighborhood.  The goal of the RFQ was to select developers to work to implement uses and further concepts articulated by the community as described in the 2015 Centre Avenue Corridor Redevelopment and Design Plan and the 2011 Greater Hill District Master Plan.  <br>“Big Tom’s vision is one that the City and the URA is seeking to repeat across the Hill District and other historically Black business districts, combining a reverence for community wishes and history, affordable residential components, and fostering economic empowerment through private and public partnerships,” Mayor William Peduto said. “I want to thank the Governor, the PHFA, URA, Neighborhood Allies and Big Tom for their work on this tremendous initiative.” | 8/4/2021 15:34:28 |

| City and Teamsters Reach Agreement on New 5 Year Contract for Environmental Services and Animal Control Employees | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 14, 2021) Salary increases, longevity bonuses and new pathways to employment are being offered to Environmental Services and Animal Control workers under a new contract agreement between Teamsters Local 249 and the City of Pittsburgh. <br>The union represents 143 Environmental Services refuse and recycling drivers and co-drivers, and 14 Animal Control employees. <br>“As Pittsburgh residents were reminded over the last challenging year, Environmental Services and Animal Control workers are essential to the quality of life in our city. I want to thank them for their service and welcome others to apply for these jobs and join us in public service,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>The 5-year agreement covering 2021-2025 includes 3% raises in the final four years of the contract (first year salaries were subject to class and compensation analysis and title consolidation), and is the first union contract to add Juneteenth as a day off since Mayor William Peduto officially adopted it as a holiday in February.  <br>In a new incentive to help recruit Environmental Services employees the new contract creates a new “loader” position that allows workers to join the bureau without having a driver’s license, which should be a benefit to those entering or re-entering the workforce. Previously all members of the unit had to have a license upon employment and obtain a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) within six months of starting their jobs. <br>For the first time, employees will now get longevity increases to their annual salaries (kicking in after the fifth year of employment) to reward those who remain longtime employees. <br>The new contract also significantly raises the wages for CDL truck drivers and co-drivers in their first years of employment with the City by eliminating the tiered wage rates for years one through three of employment and starting all drivers and co-drivers at the top wage rate. These higher wages aim to boost recruitment, make Environmental Services jobs with the City more competitive, and improve services to City residents by filling vacant positions. <br>Additionally, the new contract includes: <br>- Paid Parental Leave <br>- Paid Safe Leave <br>- A revised bereavement leave policy to account for the restrictions in place due to COVID-19 that may prevent some employees from attending funerals for family members who have died. <br>- Gender neutral pronouns (they/them/theirs) in the contract language in an effort to be more inclusive for all gender identities. | 14/4/2021 09:50:18 |

One lane of traffic along N, S, E, and W Commons will be maintained throughout the construction project. Detours will be implemented over the course of the project for East Ohio Street, North and South Federal Street, Ridge Avenue, Sandusky Street and Stockton Avenue. Advance notice will be given prior to detours being put in place.<br>A section of Ridge Avenue and East Ohio Street at Allegheny Commons will be closed beginning April 19, 2021 until early July 2021 as part of the Allegheny Circle Phase 2 (City of Pittsburgh) project.<br>The detour routes are as follows:<br>East Ohio Street: Cedar Avenue to East North Avenue to North Federal Street<br>Ridge Avenue: Arch Street to West North Avenue to North Federal Street<br>For more information about the project please see the project fact sheet located here ( [https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/current-projects](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/current-projects)). If you have questions about this you may contact DOMI by email at [patrick.bopp@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:trafficcalming@pittsburghpa.gov), or by dialing 311 or 412-255-2621. | 15/4/2021 08:34:49 |
| Mayor William Peduto Signs Executive Order to Combat Construction Fraud and Promote Worker Safety | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 15, 2021) Following lengthy study by a construction industry tax force, Mayor William Peduto today signed an Executive Order to cut down on construction fraud, promote worker safety and protect City tax revenue. <br>The Construction Fraud Executive Order will combat illicit efforts by fraudulent construction companies to commit tax, insurance, and workers’ compensation fraud to maximize their profits; use subcontractors or labor brokers to screen themselves from responsibility; pay workers in cash to avoid taxes; and decrease their labor costs.  <br>Such moves allow the corrupt firms to outbid honest ones and fuel a cycle of lost wages, decreased tax revenue, and unsafe and hazardous work sites.  <br>To combat that the Mayor and City Councilman Corey O’Connor created the labor-management Joint Task Force on Construction Industry Fraud in December 2018, which forwarded its final recommendations last month. <br>Mayor Peduto signed the Order on April 15 — the traditional tax day\* — alongside members of the Regional Council of Carpenters, which helped write the final report. <br>“Fraud has a devastating impact on worker safety and tax revenue, and it takes experts working together to fully address it. I want to thank all of our partners on working together on this effort, which will reward legitimate construction firms, protect workers and protect the City’s bottom line,” the Mayor said. <br>"The construction industry is the backbone of our region's middle class," said Councilman O'Connor. "The Joint Task Force's findings clearly show there are businesses operating in Pittsburgh that evade their tax obligations, undermine the work of law abiding businesses, and create unsafe working conditions. I applaud Mayor Peduto for taking swift action to safeguard our workers and tax dollars." <br>“Mayor Peduto has taken the time to not just listen the recommendations of the Pittsburgh Joint Task Force on Construction Industry Tax Fraud but to take action, “ said William Sproule, Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters. “Our union is proud of its participation and leadership in the task force and its goal to educate and advocate against wage theft, worker misclassification, and all forms of construction industry tax fraud. This is a step by the City of Pittsburgh to uphold workers’ rights, and create standards to help our industry work on a level playing field.” <br>The Executive Order directs the City of Pittsburgh Departments of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections (PLI) and Finance to convene a committee with representatives of the Master Builders’ Association of Western Pennsylvania, NAIOP Pittsburgh, Builders Guild of Western Pennsylvania, the American Institute of Architects-Pittsburgh Chapter, Pittsburgh Building Trades, and the Chairperson of the City of Pittsburgh Joint Task Force on Construction Industry Fraud.  <br>The committee will craft language to define the term “construction contractor” in the Pittsburgh City Code, to promote workers’ safety, combat construction industry fraud, uplift law-abiding and fair contractors, and create more accountable and transparent construction development processes.  <br>Secondly, PLI  will list the names of all construction contractors on the City of Pittsburgh’s BuildingEye website, or a similar, publicly accessible website or web-based program, to enhance transparency and accountability, discourage the dishonest use of subcontractors to avoid paying taxes and commit fraud, and shine a light on companies that are involved in construction projects throughout Pittsburgh. <br>A copy of the full Order [is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13953_Construction_Fraud_EO.pdf). <br>(\*Note: The City of Pittsburgh, the state and the federal government have pushed back tax day to May 17 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.) | 15/4/2021 08:56:10 |

| Community Asked for Input on Homewood Field and Park | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 16, 2021) Homewood community members are welcomed to provide their input Saturday afternoon on the ongoing plans to upgrade and expand Homewood Park.<br>The Department of Public Works and its partners will host residents from 1-4 p.m. Saturday, April 17, at the corner of Hamilton and N. Lang Avenues to gather their insights on the project. Refreshments will be provided. (In case of inclement weather the gathering wil be moved to the Community Empowerment Association at 7120 Kelly Street.)<br>Here is background on the redesign from DPW:<br>In 2015, Homewood Community Sports (HCS), with the help of Heinz Endowments, Operation Better Block, Neighborhood Allies, Bridging the Gap Development, and The Mission Continues began a grassroots level study of field improvements at Willie Stargell Field. The study identified some of the challenges that the site faces with the existing conditions. Currently, the field serves both as a baseball and football field, however, the field is inadequately sized for both sports.<br>HCS led an extensive community engagement process in order to develop a Master Plan for the existing Stargell Field and expansion of Homewood Park onto the previous Homewood School property along Hamilton Avenue.<br>Based on the results of the Master Plan, the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Public Works, along with these essential community partners and the landscape architecture firm Studio Zewde, will be designing the following improvements:<br>- Site engineering for the development of a combined, regulation-size football and baseball field, seating and site-wide ADA accessibility<br>- Structural engineering for retaining walls surrounding the site<br>- Relocation of existing pool and bathhouse/locker room to accommodate field renovations<br>- Site-wide stormwater management solutions, including cisterns or r-tanks under the athletic fields<br>- Connection to the Martin Luther King Jr. Busway and renovated pedestrian bridge to Westinghouse Park<br>- Cultural/performance space with connections to the Afro American Music Institute<br>- Playground and multi-purpose courts for various youth activities<br>More information on the redesign [is available here](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/homewood). | 16/4/2021 09:19:12 |

| Pittsburgh Releases Public EV Charging Strategic Plan for City Facilities | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 19, 2021) – In collaboration with the [Bloomberg Philanthropies American Cities Climate Challenge](https://www.bloomberg.org/environment/supporting-sustainable-cities/american-cities-climate-challenge/) and the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, the Department of City Planning has published an Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Strategic Plan for Pittsburgh Public Facilities.<br>This plan was created in response to the 2019 [EV Taskforce Recommendations](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/8371_EV_Task_Force_Recommendations.pdf) to create a framework for the City of Pittsburgh to leverage Pittsburgh Parking Authority lots and garages and other City facilities to expand EV charging access citywide. It provides a clear vision and targets for the City and its stakeholders, and outlines goals for expanding public EV charging access through 2025, which will help the City meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 50% by 2030.<br>Today's announcement is one of many the City and Mayor William Peduto will be making in conjunction with Earth Day on April 22.<br>Currently, the City has 35 existing public EV charging plugs, mostly serving Downtown and Oakland. By 2025, the Strategic Plan aims to expand to over 200 new public charging plugs and work with stakeholders to increase the total number of public charging plugs to over 2,000 across the City. This includes at least four plugs in each Council District and a goal to ensure every household is within a 10-minute walk of a public Level 2 charger or a 10-minute drive of a DC fast charger. Level 2 chargers take 6-8 hours to deliver a full charge, while DC fast chargers mimic more of a gas station model of fueling and charge a vehicle to 80% full within 20-30 minutes.<br>“One key recommendation outlined by the plan is to determine a sustainable financing strategy,” said Principal Resilience Planner, Rebecca Kiernan. “This means establishing appropriate pricing structures for public chargers as well as a dedicated fund to cover operational costs that allows us to invest in new chargers throughout Pittsburgh.”<br>An interdepartmental EV Task Force has been assembled to build out charging infrastructure for the City’s growing EV fleet, and will also lead the implementation of the Public EV Charging Strategic Plan.<br>Pittsburgh is one of 25 cities selected to participate in the Bloomberg Philanthropies American Cities Climate Challenge, an effort to resource cities to take strong action to reduce pollution that contributes to climate change and impacts public health. As part of the Climate Challenge, Pittsburgh has pledged to take bold action to reduce emissions from its transportation and building sectors. Working with other Climate Challenge cities and cities around the world, Pittsburgh has explored approaches to increase access to low-carbon transportation options to give residents more choice, improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br>“Pittsburgh’s Public Facility EV Charging Strategic Plan is a great example of how cities across the country are paving the way for EV adoption and accelerating the transition to low-carbon transportation,” said Kelly Shultz, lead for sustainable cities and America Is All In at Bloomberg Philanthropies. “The Bloomberg Philanthropies American Cities Climate Challenge empowers local leaders to take bold and equitable climate action that improves lives for communities. We’re thrilled that Pittsburgh continues to drive us toward that goal.”<br>A copy of the EV Strategic Charging Plan [is available here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13902_FINAL_2021_PGH_EV_Strategic_Plan.pdf).<br>###<br>_For More Information:_<br>**Audrey Wells**<br>Communications Specialist, Department of City Planning<br>[audrey.wells@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:audrey.wells@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>412-255-2215<br>**Rebecca Kiernan**<br>Principal Resilience Planner, Department of City Planning<br>[rebecca.kiernan@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:rebecca.kiernan@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>412-440-8733 | 19/4/2021 10:30:17 |

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Guilty Verdict in the Murder of George Floyd | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 20, 2021) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement today on the murder trial and guilty verdict of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin:  <br>“I was relieved to see that justice was served in the jury’s decision today finding Derek Chauvin guilty of all three charges in the horrific murder last year of George Floyd.  <br>But I also realize that no verdict can bring back a life or eliminate the pain the Floyd family and so many Americans — especially in our Black community — continue to feel. We cannot erase centuries of systemic racism, and our efforts to uplift and support our minority neighbors must continue today and for years to come.” | 20/4/2021 17:19:10 |
| Mayor Peduto Signs Executive Order to Create a Building Deconstruction Policy | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 20, 2021) Today, Mayor William Peduto issued an [Executive Order](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13981_Deconstruction_Executive_Order_-_FINAL.pdf) to create a unified, City-led deconstruction policy designed to remediate blight in city neighborhoods while diverting building materials from landfills, advancing climate action goals, promoting equity, and creating job training opportunities.  <br>The policy aims to reduce blight in neighborhoods by deconstructing city-owned properties that are condemned but not yet slated for demolition. Deconstruction is the process of disassembling an entire building or parts of it rather than demolishing it. The goal is to recover, reuse, and recycle building materials like bricks, lumber, shingles, and tile that otherwise would have be sent to landfill, while safely disposing of hazardous materials.  <br>“Data shows that living in proximity to blight can cause serious health issues for neighbors, and we also know that too many salvageable building materials languish in a landfill, which only harms our planet,” said Mayor Peduto. “Deconstruction will allow us to better remove blight from our neighborhoods, preserve assets from historic buildings, divert reusable materials from our over-burdened landfill, improve air quality, and create a pipeline for family-sustaining jobs.” <br>The Executive Order calls for the City to create a process for identifying deconstruction-eligible structures that includes taking account of neighbor and community concern about the property, focusing on structures in historically Black business districts and low-income communities, and conducting a sustainability deconstruction assessment. The policy will pilot deconstruction on city-owned properties and city facilities, but will also create standards for recovery and recycling of materials for city-funded demolitions.  <br>“Deconstruction represents yet another action that city government has taken to advance equity, achieve our climate goals, improve quality of life for our neighbors, and create well-paying jobs in the process,” said the City’s Chief Equity Officer Majestic Lane. “This policy will set a standard for other cities to follow.”  <br>Additional directives for city departments in the Executive Order include the creation of robust community engagement plans to ensure neighbors understand the process and public benefits of deconstruction. It also calls for the convening of a Deconstruction Action Council comprised of members from various city departments, industries, and institutions to study and advocate for the expansion of the policy. <br>“Deconstruction provides the City with a tool in its toolbox to remove blighted properties that have deteriorated beyond repair, but still contain materials that can be salvaged and diverted from the landfill,” said Sarah Kinter, Director of the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections. "By taking apart a building rather than using traditional demolition we can reduce construction waste, continue to address environmental hazards, and promote the highest demolition standards.” <br>"We applaud the City’s leadership to divert building material waste from landfill to productive reuse and recycling,” said Mike Gable, Executive Director of Construction Junction, community partners and local experts on the recovery, reuse and recycling of building materials. “We know from 22 years of experience in promoting the reuse of building materials that these efforts create more jobs than disposal and allow the public to make purchases that are better for the environment." <br>Details on the policy and updates will be posted [on the City’s Deconstruction website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/deconstruction). The public is encouraged to take [this survey](https://cityofpittsburgh-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/ernest_rajakone_pittsburghpa_gov/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?guestaccesstoken=AD%2f3i4by3qiw2f4sf4Zjmm3eWk1mWboB5Xxx8625kuY%3d&docid=1_19d4ea0ee497c48a99e0f75770580c8d4&wdFormId=%7B8D6D94FE%2DDDD9%2D4F65%2DA9BB%2DDEEDD75BA473%7D&action=formsubmit&cid=4af93ed7-10f6-4176-a171-c8c55f5fa627) to share ideas, interest, and feedback. | 20/4/2021 13:12:47 |

| Mayor Peduto Urges More Federal Support for Urban Forests | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 21, 2021) Mayor William Peduto delivered a letter to the White House today on behalf of 34 cities and counties across the US calling on more federal support for urban forests and their role in public health, equitable communities and economic vitality. <br>Mayor Peduto issued the letter in conjunction with Trees for Urban Recovery, a consortium of cities, counties and community and conservation organizations seeking to advance a government-wide increase for urban and community forestry in the President’s budget and to start a dialogue on how it can further support urban and community trees. <br>“As mayors committed to a better future for our cities, we thank you for advancing actions and policies that prioritize climate change and economic recovery with a strong focus on equity. As part of that commitment, we recognize the critical importance of city and community trees to economic vitality, public health, environmental justice, and effective climate action. Our urban and community forests are vital to combating climate change, creating good paying jobs, and building more equitable communities. For these nature-based solutions to flourish and for their much-needed economic and climate benefits to be realized by neighborhoods in greatest need, a decisive new approach is required. We write today to urge you to work with us to develop a robust whole-of-government partnership with the renewed federal resolve and increased Fiscal Year 2022 resources this effort will require to meet your recovery, climate, and equity goals in our jurisdictions,” the letter says.<br>Mayor Peduto issued the letter as part of the City of Pittsburgh’s Earth Day commitments in 2021, which include efforts [to increase electric vehicle charging](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4876) stations, [a new deconstruction initiative](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4881) for the reuse of building materials, [outdoor recreation opportunities](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4878) for youth, and a new Executive Order on climate change that will be issued on Earth Day tomorrow. <br>Others in Trees for Urban Recovery include American Forests, the Trust for Public Land, Urban Drawdown Initiative, and Davey Resource Group.

| Mayor Peduto Issues Executive Order Committing Pittsburgh to Be Carbon Neutral by 2050 | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 22, 2021) Mayor William Peduto issued a sweeping Earth Day Executive Order today that builds upon Pittsburgh’s leadership in fighting climate change by committing the city to become fully carbon-neutral by 2050. <br>The Order reviews concrete steps the Peduto Administration has taken the past seven years on climate change efforts and lays out the next moves City of Pittsburgh departments and authorities must make to further protect the environment. <br>The centerpiece of the Order is Pittsburgh joining the [ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability Network](https://iclei.org/en/climate_neutrality.html), in which communities agree to reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and GHG avoidance to a net-zero emission level at the latest by 2050. <br>Mayor Peduto has been one of Pittsburgh’s leading environmental voices across three decades in local government. He is the North American representative to the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, and in February joined international leaders including Special Presidential Envoy on Climate John Kerry, White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and UN Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions Mike Bloomberg to celebrate the United States rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, among other accomplishments. <br>“Climate change is a global issue but has severe local impacts on Pittsburgh residents, especially upon those in low-income communities who bear the brunt of negative impacts from rising temperatures, tainted air and water, and severe weather,” Mayor Peduto said. “The good news is we are taking serious steps to confront these issues and emerge from this crisis with

| City Celebrates the Rebuilding and Reopening of the Lowrie Street Bridge in Troy Hill | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 23, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) has announced the reopening of the Lowrie Street Bridge over Rialto Street in Troy Hill. Mayor William Peduto will be joining the Troy Hill community and DOMI project team on Saturday to cut the ribbon on this $1.14 million project.  <br>This project marks the second replacement of the Lowrie Street Bridge as the original stone abutments laid in 1900 were replaced in 1972 by a concrete structure. The bridge was fully closed to traffic in July 2020 to undergo a total rebuild due to its diminished capacity and the deterioration of its concrete beams.  <br>The bridge superstructure was demolished and replaced between 4 residential homes and suspended over one of the steepest streets in the city. The project replaced the bridge beams, deck, sidewalks, railings and added safety enhancements for pedestrians and vehicles. While the new design has a similar look to the previous bridge, the team employed enhanced engineering technologies to ensure the bridge will serve the Troy Hill community for another 75+ years.   <br>"Replacing the Lowrie Street Bridge is an essential infrastructure investment in Troy Hill,” said City Councilman Bobby Wilson. “After a $1.14 million construction project, I am thrilled the bridge will again be fully open to the public. I am very appreciative of the hard work of the Department of Mobility & Infrastructure, Mayor Peduto’s Office and all the government partners that helped us reopen this bridge." <br>"Troy Hill is excited to have Lowrie Street and Rialto Street open again after a substantial rebuild of the Lowrie Street Bridge,” said Abby Vanim, President of the Troy Hill Citizens community group. “As two of the main arteries in our neighborhood, Lowrie and Rialto provide essential access to our business district and for our neighbors and friends. Troy Hill Citizens appreciates our neighbors’ patience and understanding during this project. Thank you to the City and the project contractors, as they dealt with weather delays and issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic to get this completed. We look forward to celebrating the re-opening!”  <br>The construction team was led by A. Merante Contracting, with SAI Consulting Engineers overseeing construction and conducting daily inspections. The team also coordinated with People’s and Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, who have utility lines supported by the bridge.   <br>Troy Hill Citizens will host a reopening community celebration with neighbors and city officials as they cut the ribbon on the bridge at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 24.   <br>BEFORE: View of the previous Lowrie Street Bridge from Below on Rialto Street <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14072_Lowrie_Bridge_Before.jpg)<br>AFTER: View of the newly constructed bridge from Lowrie Street <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14073_Lowrie_Bridge_After.jpg) | 23/4/2021 09:23:01 |

| URA Announces Free Housing Legal Services for City of Pittsburgh Renters and Homeowners | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 10, 2021) The Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) announced today that the [Housing Opportunity Fund](https://www.ura.org/pages/HOF)’s (HOF) Legal Assistance Program (LAP) is officially up and running just in time to meet the legal needs of City residents as the [national eviction moratorium](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-eviction-declaration.html) is set to expire in June 2021. The $1 million program is expected to serve over 1,300 households.   <br>LAP is the first legal assistance program in the City of Pittsburgh to offer a slate of five different free legal services to income-qualifying households. The services include:   <br>**Tenant Services**<br>- Mediation: Third party trained mediators facilitate a resolution between landlord and tenant issues.   <br>- Limited Legal Consultation: Attorneys provide limited and brief legal advice related to tenant issues and provide information on options, rights and responsibilities.  <br>- Full Legal Representation: Attorneys provide representation through court proceedings to help prevent evictions and stabilize housing.   <br>**Homeowner Services**<br>- Tangled Title: Legal assistance to help transfer the home’s record title to the current occupant.  <br>- Foreclosure Prevention: Assistance to help prevent foreclosure by helping to explore options such as repayment plans, forbearance and deferrals, mortgage modifications, refinancing and/or bankruptcy.    <br>“Access to housing is a basic human right, and for too many Pittsburghers during this pandemic the threat of losing homes has been a constant worry, especially for those with low incomes. The City and URA are doing all they can to provide tenants and homeowners with the protections they need to provide their families shelter,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>At the April 2021 URA Board meeting, five agencies were approved to serve as the providers for the Legal Assistance Program. The firms are:  <br>- [Community Justice Project](https://www.communityjusticeproject.org/) (Coordinated entry; legal services for undocumented residents)  <br>- [Neighborhood Legal Services](https://www.nlsa.us/) (Limited legal consultation; Full legal representation; Tangled title; Foreclosure prevention)  <br>- [Just Mediation Pittsburgh](https://www.justmediationpgh.org/) (Mediation services)  <br>- [Morant Law](http://www.morantlawoffices.com/) (Tangled title)  <br>- [Ebony Law](https://ebonylaw.com/) (Limited legal consultation; Full legal representation)  <br>The Legal Assistance Program was funded out of the Housing Opportunity Fund 2021 Annual Allocation Plan. The guidelines were approved in March 2021 after a robust community input process gathering feedback on program design from nearly a dozen groups operating in the housing and legal assistance environment in Pittsburgh.   <br>“We set out to make a comprehensive legal assistance program that serves both tenants and homeowners,” said URA Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker. “We’ve incorporated systems to make it easier to obtain financial assistance to help resolve the housing issue - whether that is rent assistance, mortgage payments or financing to help landlords fix up their units. We are also excited to bring mediation services into the mix as this has been a proven method to resolve issues between landlords and tenants, prevent eviction filings, and stabilize households often without involving the courts.”  <br>The program is utilizing [RentHelpPGH](https://renthelppgh.org/about) and the [Pittsburgh Hispanic Development Corporation](https://www.phdcincubator.org/) (PHDC) to serve as coordinated entry for this program, because they have been providing a similar service throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, $43,000 of funding is specifically earmarked to serve residents who may be undocumented or otherwise ineligible from receiving services from other legal assistance providers.   <br>Walker continued, “It was imperative to ensure that the program was diverse - in services and staff. This slate of services ensures that we meet the housing legal needs of our residents, regardless of where they are in resolving their problem. We also ensured that we had diverse providers offering the services.” <br>To be eligible, renters must have total household income at or below 50% Area Median Income (AMI) and homeowners must have total household income at or below 80% AMI. Participants must be a City of Pittsburgh resident. The legal need must be related to housing stability.   <br>**For a Legal Assistance Program referral, please call: 412-534-6600**<br>_**For non-English speakers, call: 412-530-5244**_<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14236_Legal-Assistance-Program-Flyer_Page_1.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14237_Legal-Assistance-Program-Flyer_Page_2.jpg) | 10/5/2021 09:58:13 |

| Mayor Peduto Joining Lawrenceville Community for Centennial Celebration of Doughboy Statue | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 28, 2021) Mayor William Peduto will be joining the [Lawrenceville Historical Society](https://www.lawrencevillehistoricalsociety.org/newsevents/) and community on Sunday, May 30, 2021 to commemorate the centennial of the neighborhood’s iconic Doughboy statue at the intersection of Penn Avenue and Butler Street.  <br>The Doughboy statue serves as the iconic entryway into the Lawrenceville neighborhood. The community organization at the time, the Lawrenceville Board of Trade, led community fundraising efforts throughout 1918-1919 to commission the statue. It was designed by Allen Newman and approved by the City of Pittsburgh Art Commission in 1920. It was dedicated on May 30, 1921.  <br>Throughout its one hundred years as serving as a symbol of the Lawrenceville neighborhood, the community has worked to preserve the statue. In 1947, it was redesigned to include the names of 2,729 service men and women around the circular plinth that the Doughboy stands atop. There was also a large community effort in the 1980s led by the then-Lawrenceville Citizens Council to refurbish the Doughboy and the surrounding area they called “Doughboy Square”.  <br>Members of the Lawrenceville community continue to promote the preservation and fundraising efforts for the Doughboy statue and work with the City on its maintenance. Mayor Peduto will be joined by the Lawrenceville Historical Society, Lawrenceville Corporation, Lawrenceville United, VFW Posts 214 and 351 and community advocates for the commemoration event.  <br>A video will be produced by the City Channel Pittsburgh from the event with interviews about the Doughboy from key community historians and members that will be available on the [City’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/citychannelpittsburgh).  <br>Motorist may experience some delays near this location during the 12:30 p.m. ceremony as there will be partial closures on Penn and Butler to safely accommodate the audience attendees. | 28/5/2021 10:22:29 |
| City of Pittsburgh Receives Two Grants to Make Historical Records More Accessible | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 1, 2021) The Office of the City Clerk has been awarded over $140,000 to support two projects designed to increase the accessibility of City records.<br>A grant of $133,934 from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission of the National Archives will fund a two-year project to increase access to a backlog of 751 cubic feet of historical government records. The collections targeted in this project provide an unprecedented window into primary source material from important entities of the City of Pittsburgh, including City Council, the City Planning Department, the City Planning Commission, the Historic Review Commission, the Department of Public Works and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.<br>Dating from the formation of the City in 1816 to the early 2000s, the records document the evolution of the city’s built environment and the administrative, legal and policy decisions that supported its development over two centuries. The funding will support the hiring of project staff to process, preserve and catalog the records. Over 50 years of Planning Commission minutes (1918-1969) will also be digitized and made available online.<br>Additionally, a Records Care Grant from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC) will provide $8,016 in support of an ongoing effort by the Clerk’s Office to digitize the City’s entire legislative history. The Office has already digitized City Council meeting minutes and legislation dating back to 1868 and made the information available online here: [https://pittsburghpa.gov/clerk/instructions](https://pittsburghpa.gov/clerk/instructions).<br>The Records Care grant will expand this digitization effort to include City Council meeting minutes from 1816 to 1877, as well as legislation and minutes from over 20 annexed municipalities, including the City of Allegheny and former boroughs such as Birmingham, Carrick, Lawrenceville and Manchester. Digitization will reduce physical handing of these fragile records, which will also be rehoused in acid-free enclosures to ensure long-term preservation.<br>“The City Clerk’s Office is the official repository for historical government records of the City of Pittsburgh,” said City Clerk Brenda Pree. “And our goal in being the keeper of these records is to make them easily available and accessible. These grants will allow our records management division to expand on our current digitization and access efforts and continue our commitment to service by making our records more accessible.”<br>The digitized content from both grant projects will be made available on the POWER Library’s Pennsylvania Photos and Documents web site, administered by the State of Pennsylvania. For more information, contact City Archivist Nick Hartley at nicholas.hartley@pittsburghpa.gov or 412-255-2138. | 1/6/2021 10:48:55 |
| Construction Begins on Reynolds Street Neighborway | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 1, 2021) The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is pleased to announce the construction of the Reynolds Street Neighborway from Beechwood Boulevard to the Hawthorne Trail past Carnegie Place as part of the Move Forward PGH program.<br>The project will include the installation of neighborhood traffic circles at the intersection of Reynold Street and S Murtland Street and S Lang Avenue. Reynolds Street’s new traffic circles will incorporate design standards that increase accessibility of these intersections for persons with disabilities.

Once installed, DOMI will monitor the project area and modify designs as appropriate.<br>Work is tentatively expected to begin on Wednesday June 2, 2021 and is expected to last until Thursday June 3rd, weather permitting. Hours of construction will be from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. each day. These intersections will remain open, but drivers may experience short delays due to flagging operations.<br>Thank you for your cooperation during this time and we hope there will be only minor inconveniences. If you have questions about this project or other Move Forward projects, you may contact us by email at moveforwardpgh@gmail.com, or by calling 311 or 412-255-2621.

| City Releases Citywide Pedestrian Safety Action Plan | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 2, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is pleased to announce the release of the City’s first Pedestrian Safety Action Plan (PSAP) – key component of Mayor William Peduto’s commitment to Complete Streets. The PSAP identifies the necessary policies and infrastructure improvements required to reduce the number and severity of crashes involving pedestrians.<br>DOMI will be hosting a virtual lunch-and-learn event to introduce plan goals and vision and kick off implementation on June 16th, 2021 from noon to 1 PM. Registration and details for the event are [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZArf--vrjIpHtD80T3NzJJ3oetAxVkDabmh). Residents may also call the DOMI at (412) 255-8850 for assistance in registering.<br>According to census data, Pittsburgh has one of the highest rates of pedestrian commuting in the country, and is one of the least-dependent employment markets. While Pittsburghers enjoy walking, it is not without risk. A review of crash data from the last five years reveals that pedestrian deaths are overrepresented in the total roadway fatalities in the city. Based on a detailed analysis of local crash data, the plan identifies critical pedestrian safety issues, locations with a higher risk for pedestrian crashes, specific actions that DOMI will undertake to improve safety, and metrics for monitoring performance over time.<br>The PSAP was developed over multiple years through a collaborative effort by DOMI, the Federal Highway Administration, and a core group of local stakeholders from the Pittsburgh Complete Streets Advisory Committee. A number of the plan’s recommendations have already been implemented while work is underway on other recommended actions, including the implementation of the city’s Safe Routes to School Program and data collection and evaluation on sidewalk and curb ramp conditions with the help of PGH Lab 6.0 partner, pathVu.<br>The PSAP can be reviewed [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/psap-events). | 2/6/2021 10:10:19 |

| Mayor Peduto Joins Representative Frankel and Community Advocates in Support of State Firearm Preemption Reform | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 3, 2021) City of Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto joined local and state elected officials and community organizations today to announce support for Pennsylvania State Representative Dan Frankel’s proposed legislation that would enable municipalities to pass their own gun reform ordinances, which is currently limited by Pennsylvania’s preemption law.  <br>Representative Frankel has [proposed two pieces of legislation](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&SPick=20210&cosponId=34355&mobile_choice=suppress) that will enable municipalities to pass their own gun reform ordinances that reflect residents’ desire to balance second amendment rights with protections of local and community interests. One bill would remove existing preemption language from the Second Class County Code and the other would remove existing preemption language from both Title 18 (Crimes) and Title 53 (Municipalities).  <br>"Far too many of our neighbors' lives have been stolen in mass shootings and neighborhood gun violence. Cities like Pittsburgh have taken bold action to prevent gun violence, but we need help from Harrisburg to keep our residents and visitors safe and prevent future tragedies," said Mayor William Peduto. "I am proud to support Representative Frankel's legislation that would allow local governments to enact commonsense and reasonable gun reform measures that our communities want and are proven to save lives." <br>There has been overwhelming support for locally-proposed gun reforms in the City of Pittsburgh to prevent gun violence, including laws prohibiting assault weapons, prohibiting firearms modifications and certain ammunition, and an Extreme Risk Protection Order that would allow family members to petition courts to temporarily remove firearms from someone who poses a danger to themselves or others. However, many legal actions taken locally and statewide have been blocked by the preemption law. The City of Pittsburgh recently filed an [Amicus Brief](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4825) in support of the City of Philadelphia’s legal challenge to state preemption law.  <br>Rep. Dan Frankel, who co-founded the PA Safe Caucus 22 years ago to fight for firearm regulations in Harrisburg, said that it is long past time to allow municipal governments to do what state legislators have failed to do. <br>“The reality here is that Pennsylvanians are dying, communities are suffering, and we can do something about it,” Frankel said. “If the state legislature can’t look at the evidence and act to protect the public when it comes to firearm regulation, it needs to get out of the way and allow local officials to keep their residents safe.” <br>Mayor Peduto and Representative Frankel were joined by State Senator Jay Costa, City Councilman Corey O’Connor, City Councilperson Erika Strassburger, and several community-based organizations advocating for commonsense gun regulations such as Voices Against Violence, Moms Demand Action, CeaseFirePA and others.  <br>In addition to gun reform laws, Mayor Peduto’s administration has advocated for community-based violence prevention through creating the Group Violence Intervention team, [STOP the Violence](https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/ps-initiatives), [Health, Safety, and Violence Prevention](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4429) Initiative, [expanding gun violence data](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4914) collection and analysis, [My Brother’s Keeper community violence mini-grant program](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4938), [funding for community-based gun violence prevention programs](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4224), and more. | 3/6/2021 11:43:01 |
| Local Food Policy Collaboration Launches Pittsburgh's First Food Equity Ambassador Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 3, 2021) The Pittsburgh Food Policy Council (PFPC) and #PghFoodTeam is announcing the first cohort of the newly created Pittsburgh Food Equity Ambassador Program.  From over 50 applications, the first Ambassador cohort of 13 residents represent all nine Pittsburgh City Council Districts.<br>The Pittsburgh Food Equity Ambassador program will kick off on Friday, June 4th and include a series of 9 sessions over the next six months to learn from residents about food systems challenges and triumphs and  build community, while developing leadership and advocacy skills. The program seeks to grow partnerships between local governments and communities by co- designing impactful policy solutions. “The pandemic has exacerbated  food insecurity in the region. This program seeks to center community voices in policymaking to address Pittsburgh’s food inequities through the building of robust community food systems and healthy communities,” says Dawn Plummer, Executive Director of the Pittsburgh Food Policy Council about the program.<br>The PghFoodTeam was selected as one of 20 local teams nationwide to participate in the [Healthiest Cities & Counties Challenge](http://www.healthiestcities.org/), a program funded by the Aetna Foundation, together with the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the National Association of Counties (NACo). The Challenge seeks to significantly expand and deepen grassroots leadership and participation in policymaking on urgent matters of healthy food access and preventable chronic disease.  The [Aetna Foundation](https://www.aetna-foundation.org/), which first launched the Healthiest Cities & Counties Challenge in partnership with APHA and NACo in 2016, is an independent, charitable and philanthropic affiliate of [CVS Health](https://cvshealth.com/). The PghFoodTeam, led by the [Pittsburgh Food Policy Council](https://www.pittsburghfoodpolicy.org/), teamed up with leaders at the [City of Pittsburgh](https://www.pittsburghfoodpolicy.org/), [Allegheny County Health Department](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/healthdepartment/index.aspx), [American Heart Association-Greater Pittsburgh](https://www.heart.org/en/affiliates/pennsylvania/pittsburgh), and [One Pennsylvania](https://onepa.org/vote/) to pursue two goals. The first goal is to identify [healthy food priority areas](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/food-access-programs) in Pittsburgh for policy action and focused collective impact. The second goal is to create a consistent mechanism to meaningfully engage residents with local government to co-design policy that positively impacts food and health equity in priority communities.<br>"As we know from the suffering we faced the last year, food insecurity impacts residents in every walk of life and every corner of our city. Working directly with our residents to design food policies that best serve them is precisely the right move at this juncture, and on behalf of all the PghFoodTeam partners I want to thank our Food Equity Ambassadors for their service," Mayor William Peduto said.<br>The nine sessions of the Food Equity Ambassador program will cover topics related to food access such as urban gardens, food apartheid, farmers markets, and transportation that are determined by program participants. Ambassadors will be invited to share their experiences and develop solutions to food access barriers with support from local leaders that include the City of Pittsburgh staff. With grant support provided by the Challenge via the Aetna Foundation, Ambassadors will be compensated for their participation and will have significant opportunities to shape the direction of the program. The Ambassadors, ranging from high school student to elders, include;<br>- Carol Gerner  (District 1, Northside)<br>- Tacumba Turner Jr. (District 2, Sheraden)<br>- Nathaniel Palmer (District 3, Oakland)<br>- Lisa Reihl (District 4, Beecheview)<br>- Christina Mays-Walker (District 5, Hazelwood)<br>- Giavanna Gibson (District 5, Greenfield)<br>- Marcia Scott (District 6, Hill District)<br>- Teaira Collins (District 6, Hill District)<br>- Abigail Gildea (District 7, Bloomfield)<br>- Manuel Michaca (District 8, Shadyside)<br>- Betty Lane (District 9, Larimer)<br>- Anna Sekine (District 9, Garfield)<br>- Zinna Scott (District 9, Homewood)<br>This inaugural cohort will set the stage for what we hope will be a permanent pathway for residents to collaborate with local government and regional leaders in order to accelerate systems change and policy action on food and health equity in the city of bridges.<br>**Contact:**<br>Dawn Plummer, Pittsburgh Food Policy Council, 412-406-6061, dawn@pittsburghfoodpolicy.org<br>###<br>_The Pittsburgh Food Policy Council (PFPC) brings together stakeholders from across the food system to examine, develop and improve our region.  As a collective impact organization, participants in the work of the PFPC are our most important asset. The PFPC comprises individuals and representatives of organizations and stakeholders from all sectors of the local food system. The PFPC seeks to build a just, equitable and sustainable food system._ | 3/6/2021 17:13:00 |

| Welcoming Pittsburgh and Partners Host Call for Safe, Stable Housing for Refugee Resettlement | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 3, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Welcoming Pittsburgh initiative co-hosted a [webinar](https://pittsburghpa.gov/wp/renting-to-refugees) last week called Renting to _Refugees in Allegheny County_, a session for landlords to learn about the opportunity to rent to refugees in partnership with refugee resettlement agencies. Twenty-four local landlords and counting have agreed to assist the families who are anticipated to join the Greater Pittsburgh community in the coming months.  <br>The webinar was hosted in response to President Biden’s announcement that the United States will accept 62,500 refugees this year, including Pittsburgh as a resettlement destination. Refugees are people recognized by the United States government who have left their country and are unable to return to that country due to a well-founded fear of persecution. <br>Landlords were able to learn about refugees, how resettlement agencies help them establish themselves in communities across the United States and the opportunity to partner with agencies to offer safe, stable housing options in Pittsburgh. Landlords who are interested in working with the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) to provide housing for refugees can fill out [this poll](https://forms.gle/YAe7LejW8rPkFsK88).  <br>The webinar included representatives from local federally-recognized refugee resettlement agencies Acculturation for Justice, Access and Peace Outreach (AJAPO) and Jewish Family and Community Services (JFCS) as well as a representative from HUD. Additional partners include All for All, Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, ANSAR, City of Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, Allegheny County Department of Human Services and CREATE Lab.  <br>This announcement comes just days ahead of World Refugee Day on June 18 and Welcoming Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership’s [World Square](https://fb.me/e/2mNVKDKEm) running June 11-13, celebrating all of Pittsburgh's neighbors with a showcase of businesses, artists, makers, performers, food purveyors and more from across various international communities in Market Square. | 2/6/2021 15:05:14 |

Via a showcase of businesses, artists, makers, performers, and food purveyors from across the various international newcomer communities, the event creates a welcoming environment for the Pittsburgh community to experience a diverse array of cultures in a spirit of inclusivity.<br>“Celebrating our rich immigrant cultures and providing opportunities for them to inform our community about the diversity and energy that help shape our city and has never been more important than now” said Mayor Peduto. “We’re thrilled to see the return of this event Downtown, and to recognize and celebrate the cultural expressions of our international neighbors.” <br>The vibrant return will find vendors of hand-crafted items, prepared foods, live entertainment, and much more, spanning three consecutive days that, with drastically reduced safety mandates for outdoor gatherings, is expected to see a significant increase in foot traffic – an extra boost for those vendors who faced serious challenges throughout 2020. <br>“World Square aims to help build connections through an entertaining and immersive experience that highlights the diversity of the various communities that call Pittsburgh home,” said Feyisola Akintola, of Welcoming Pittsburgh. “We have such a vibrant immigrant, refugee, and international community in Pittsburgh. It’s really exciting to have representation of these diverse cultures, different foods, cultural performances and musical acts, and bring them to increasingly engaged audiences in a positive and accurate way.” <br>A sampling of vendors includes: <br>- Alquisiras Restaurante y Paletería, serving authentic Mexican ice cream <br>- Authentically African by Moa, imported West African fashion and accessories, as well as handmade crafts <br>- Costa RicART, featuring handmade goods crafted from reused materials <br>- El Rincon Oaxaqueño, specializing in authentic oaxaqueño recipes <br>- Pisko Peruvian Gourmet, serving authentic Peruvian food <br>- You Can Call Me YOKO, handmade gemstone and crystals jewelry <br>- Zafaron Afghan Cuisine, featuring delicious dishes from Afghanistan <br>- and more. <br>Entertainment will vary over the three days, including performances by Pittsburgh Samba, Oladayo, Geña y Peña, Alba Flamenca, Naina Kathak Dance Troupe, and others.

| URA Board to Vote on New Affordable Housing in East Liberty at Former Parking Lot Site | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 14, 2021) More affordable housing will be coming to East Liberty through an agreement between the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh and Trek Development Group. <br>The URA board is set to vote Thursday on selling a parking lot at the corner of Harvard and Beatty streets to Trek to make way for a 42-unit mixed-income apartment building. The Harvard Beatty development follows the completion of Trek’s mixed-income Mellon’s Orchard development nearby on Station Street.  <br>Both developments are in response to the wave of high-end market-rate rental housing development in the area and the subsequent loss of affordable housing in the East End, including the loss of housing at Penn Plaza. Developers are working with the URA and housing relocation agencies to notify displaced residents of the new housing opportunities, and the new housing comes with long-term deed restrictions to keep them affordable. <br>Of the 42 units planned at Harvard Beatty, nine are market rate; four are available at or below 20% Area Median Income (AMI); four at or below 30% AMI; 14 at or below 50% AMI; and 11 at or below 60% AMI. <br>Harvard Beatty was awarded an allocation of 9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) by the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency (PHFA) in August 2020 to help finance the construction. That was part of [a record number of low-income housing credits secured last year](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4228) by Mayor William Peduto’s administration in support of affordable housing developments citywide. <br>At Thursday’s meeting the URA board plans to sell the property to Trek and approve a $450,000 Rental Gap Program loan with the developer. | 14/6/2021 14:27:53 |

| ShotSpotter Data Shows the Technology Has Saved Lives | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 15, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh announced data from 2019 and 2020 today that shows the system was the only reporting mechanism to first responders for 13 shooting victims over the past two years. <br>ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection service that uses a wide-area network of acoustic sensors to detect when a gun is fired and then precisely and quickly pinpoints the location of the gunfire. In less than a minute, police and 911 dispatchers are notified of the validated gunfire incidents, even if no one calls 911. The ShotSpotter system was piloted in Pittsburgh Police Zone 5 before being deployed citywide in 2018.<br>In 2019 there were 5 shootings where police and paramedics responded to a ShotSpotter notification without any 911 call and found a victim. In 2020, that number grew to 8 shootings. Without the ShotSpotter notification, it is unknown when, if ever, first responders would have been notified and given the opportunity to provide life saving care.<br>In addition to these shootings where first responders were able to save lives, nearly 31% of all ShotSpotter notifications in 2020 did not also have any accompanying 911 call. This allowed police to recover critical evidence and guns that would have otherwise been missed. | 15/6/2021 13:08:23 |

| Pittsburgh Joins Six Midsize Cities in National Effort to Advance Opportunity and Equity Through Housing Policy | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 16, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) announced today Pittsburgh’s participation in the [Housing Solutions Lab](http://www.localhousingsolutions.org/lab), a nationally-funded policy initiative for small and midsize cities to advance innovative, evidence-based solutions to address their pressing housing challenges.  <br>The Housing Solutions Lab, led by an interdisciplinary team from the New York University Furman Center with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, will help seven cities to plan, develop, implement, monitor, and evaluate promising local housing policies that advance equity and opportunity for Pittsburgh residents. While large coastal cities often receive the majority of policy attention for their housing challenges, the Housing Solutions Lab will focus on serving cities with populations between 5,000 and 500,000.  <br>"The City of Pittsburgh is thankful for this great opportunity to have real discussions and think about real solutions for affordable housing with cities that have similar concerns, similar resources but unique local community needs and challenges,” said Mayor William Peduto. “We look forward to working with the six other cities to design equitable solutions so that all Pittsburghers can find and live in quality affordable housing.” <br>In order to foster shared learning and innovation among city leaders, one component of the Lab’s work will be to host housing policy peer networks with cities across the country. Pittsburgh was selected to participate in the inaugural group, which also includes Arlington, TX; Boulder, CO; Cleveland, OH; Jackson, MS; Oakland, CA; and Syracuse, NY.  <br>The City and URA will be using this opportunity to use citywide data analysis and peer support to examine the historic and current context of affordable housing, vacant parcels and neighborhood development throughout Pittsburgh. This will allow them to design programs and solutions to meet the unique affordable housing needs of our communities.  <br>“The City of Pittsburgh and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh are looking forward to furthering the work of housing equity in Pittsburgh in collaboration with the Housing Solutions Lab and our fellow cities through this innovative program,” said Jeremy Carter, Housing Opportunity Fund Consumer Programs’ Manager at the URA. “Pittsburgh has unique challenges and assets related to housing policy and equity including its complex history, geography, environmental factors and the housing stock and availability in our City. We have an incredible opportunity to work with and learn from other similar-sized cities on how to advance housing policy work that results in a more equitable and just Pittsburgh for all.” <br>“Through our first Housing Solutions peer network, we’ve gained incredibly valuable insights into the ways that small and midsize cities are tackling housing instability and a variety of other concerns, particularly during the COVID-19 crisis,” said Martha Galvez, Executive Director of the Housing Solutions Lab. “Working with Pittsburgh and the other network cities has helped lay the foundation for our new Housing Solutions Lab, which will take the next step to identify and share the most successful policy solutions that are steeped in values of racial equity, cross-sector collaboration, and elevating the voice of marginalized communities.” <br>The Housing Solutions Lab provides the following services to cities: <br>1. Policy and Data Analysis: Helping cities to use data to design, adapt and monitor local housing programs and policies <br>2. Policy Evaluations: Developing and conducting evaluations to examine the effectiveness of local housing policies and programs  <br>3. Technical Assistance: Assisting cities with real-time policy and program implementation <br>4. Peer Support: Facilitating connections between city leaders to foster shared learning, support, and innovation  <br>5. Dissemination: Collaborating with localities to develop and disseminate policy products that highlight successful strategies and outcomes   <br>NYU Furman Center Media Contact: <br>Charles McNally<br>charles.mcnally@nyu.edu<br>917-512-1571<br>About the NYU Furman Center: The NYU Furman Center advances research and debate on housing, neighborhoods, and urban policy.

Research shows pre-K children benefit from the socialization and hands-on activities central to early learning curriculums found in many childcare programs. The fund is a welcome step in addressing this issue and is sure to have a widespread impact on the wellbeing of our community.”<br>Launching June 23, 2021, the loan program will be paired with additional technical assistance opportunities for childcare businesses through partnerships with Chatham University’s Center for Women’s Entrepreneurship and Trying Together.<br>The pilot program will be part of Invest PGH, a new nonprofit and Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) organization that aids small business and affordable housing initiatives throughout the City of Pittsburgh. | 17/6/2021 10:13:54 |

Corporation (NYSE: FNB), is providing a generous $1 million capital investment to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to help support small contractors in the Hill District through the new Avenues of Hope Small Contractor Line of Credit program.<br>Mayor William Peduto and the URA [launched](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4380) [Avenues of Hope](https://www.ura.org/pages/avenues-of-hope) in October to reprioritize business district investments in diverse city neighborhoods. Through the new Small Contractor Line of Credit program, lines of credit of up to $100,000 will be available.

| City Secures Former Veterans Administration Site | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 21, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has finalized the acquisition – for free – of the former VA Highland Drive campus in Lincoln-Lemington, with plans to create a regional Public Safety training site and introduce stormwater management solutions to the flood-plagued Washington Boulevard corridor. <br>The moves will also allow the City to save millions of taxpayer dollars on leases of private properties used by the Department of Public Safety and to move key City-owned properties and parcels back onto tax rolls. <br>Placing the Public Safety facilities on Highland Drive would allow the City to move out of properties it owns on the Strip District riverfront and the Emergency Medical Services headquarters in Shadyside; opt out of leases for Police Headquarters and the Police Training Academy in Chateau and Allegheny West; and relocate Public Safety facilities on Washington Boulevard to make way for stormwater remediation efforts in the corridor.  <br>Renovations at the VA buildings will be net zero (meaning they have efficiencies making them produce as much energy as they consume), following City building requirements in 2019 legislation introduced by the Peduto Administration. <br>“This site provides us with a historic opportunity that we cannot let pass us by,” Mayor William Peduto said. “We can advance sustainable green development in the city, provide a solution to decades of intractable flood mitigation challenges in the area, offer the best in life-saving training to personnel from around the region, and expand the City’s tax base.”  <br>The Veterans Administration vacated the Highland Drive Medical Center property in 2013 and announced plans to dispose of it in 2017. The City submitted plans to the General Services Administration the following year to take it over, for free, the following year. <br>Federal government agencies approved its use by the City as a Public Safety complex and signed a Memorandum of Understanding on transferring the property early this year. The City plans to use it as a state of the art Public Safety Training Academy; a Public Safety Department and Emergency Management headquarters; a home for police K-9 and mounted units; storage of emergency response and winter weather response vehicles and equipment; and other uses. <br>Long-term financing plans for the training center are listed in the [City’s 2021 Capital Budget](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12734_Capital_budget_as_approved_12-21-20.pdf). | 21/6/2021 09:39:51 |

| City of Pittsburgh Launches Community Engagement Website for Condemned Structures | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 24, 2021) – The City of Pittsburgh Department of Permits, Licenses and <br>Inspections (PLI) has launched a new interactive website on [EngagePGH](http://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/pli-demolition-engagement) for the city’s condemned <br>properties. Residents can view all condemned structures and key information about them as well as <br>provide comments on specific structures. Community feedback collected from the site will be used with <br>PLI’s internal condemned properties scoring system to prioritize demolitions and better account for <br>community and funding needs. <br>“We are dedicated to ensuring continued safety in our built environment. In 2020, PLI performed 29 <br>emergency demolitions to imminently dangerous properties,” said PLI Director Sarah Kinter. “PLI will <br>continue to immediately demolish the most dangerous structures in the city. This webpage provides us <br>with an opportunity to incorporate public feedback into our decisions to prioritize demolition of <br>condemned structures that are not imminently dangerous, but are unsafe and effect the wellbeing of <br>neighbors.”<br>Currently, there are more than 1,900 condemned properties across the city that require ongoing <br>assessment and monitoring. In June 2020, PLI launched a new code enforcement system in [OneStopPGH](http://pittsburghpa.gov/onestoppgh/index.html)<br>which allows them to automate inspection cycles and adopt a new scoring system to standardize and <br>accurately compare condemned structures. Within the last year, PLI's team of Vacant Property Inspectors <br>have scored over 1,600 of the current condemned properties.<br>The scoring system, which ranges from one to 60, allows the City to appropriately identify the worst <br>structures, anticipate the need and costs for annual demolitions, and provide other agencies with <br>information about structures that can be put back into productive use. It’s based on structural factors such <br>as major and minor damage to key building elements and additional conditions including the structure’s <br>proximity to the right of way and to adjacent occupied structures. The City’s Department of City Planning <br>(DCP) has also scored condemned buildings to identify and save key structures that are historically and <br>architecturally significant.<br>For more information, visit the [EngagePGH site.](http://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/pli-demolition-engagement) | 24/6/2021 12:10:37 |

Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.    <br>While many residents are continuing to work from home, the City will be continuing extra efforts to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for resurfacing will be posted weekly on [DOMI’s website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule) and will be publicized through city social media channels. | 25/6/2021 11:20:27 |

| Mayor Peduto Joins Robotics and Technology Leaders to Celebrate Region's Successes | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 29, 2021) Today, Mayor William Peduto will be meeting with local robotics industry leaders and _TechCrunch_ at two events to discuss the technology ecosystem in Pittsburgh. Mayor Peduto will be attending the Pittsburgh Robotics Network event in Lawrenceville this morning and will be a keynote speaker at _TechCrunch_’s virtual [City Spotlight: Pittsburgh](https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg) at 2:00 p.m. <br>Growth in the technology sector has thrived over the last decade, with the [Pittsburgh Robotics Network](https://robopgh.org/) reporting that there are over 7,000 jobs in the robotics industry in Pittsburgh and over $3.4 billion invested in local robotics companies. With Pittsburgh as the home for over 105 robotics organizations, the region is leading the United States in basic science, research and development in robotics and artificial intelligence and has emerged as an opportunity hub for technology companies, startups and talent.  <br>“As our technology economy grows stronger, our city grows stronger. We retain the talent our universities attract, we emerge as a leader in research and development globally, we attract investment into our communities, we support our locally-owned and small businesses and we create the opportunity to educate and train the next generation of Pittsburghers to participate in the technology sector,” said Mayor Peduto.  <br>Supporting the technology ecosystem has been part of Pittsburgh’s economic development strategy.  Mayor Peduto has forged partnerships with leaders in several industries including government, technology, health care, universities, corporations and philanthropies to promote equitable growth of the technology sector for today and tomorrow’s Pittsburgh. This includes Pittsburgh-based startup Duolingo,  Pittsburgh’s first venture capital-funded $1 billion startup, which filed to go public yesterday.  <br>To encourage the growth of tech talent within our communities, the Peduto Administration piloted and implemented [Rec2Tech](https://pittsburghpa.gov/citiparks/rec2tech), a program for community recreation centers to use city resources to increase access to technology for young people and provide them learning opportunities to create career paths in innovation and technology.  <br>In an effort to further support the startup community, Mayor Peduto also created an incubator within city hall by launching [PGH Lab](https://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/pghlab/index.html), which is currently hosting its sixth cohort. Local startups are paired with city departments or authorities to test new products and provide innovative solutions that improve the efficiency, transparency, sustainability and inclusivity of government services. [PGH Lab 6.0 focused on equity and community-impact applications](https://medium.com/department-of-innovation-performance/pghlab-is-back-focused-on-equity-and-community-impact-9d7a8a7b4d6f#) and will be hosting a [virtual company showcase](https://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-civicinnovation-meetup/events/278911210/) tomorrow at 11 a.m. PGH Lab is part of the city’s Inclusive Innovation initiative, celebrating and encouraging diversity and innovation in the technology and Pittsburgh community. | 29/6/2021 10:19:11 |
| City Creates Grant Program to Support Community Youth Sports Programs | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 29, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and City Council President Theresa Kail-Smith have proposed the creation of a new Youth Sports Grant Program that will allow neighborhood and community sports organizations to apply for funding.  <br>Many communities organize sport programs to provide development opportunities for young people, but managing youth sport programming can be costly. Grant funding from this program can be used to fund operations and purchasing of equipment and uniforms. The program is budgeted to have $150,000 a year available for applications from community sports organizations and will be managed by the Department of Parks and Recreation.  <br>“I’d like to thank Mayor Peduto, Chief of Staff Dan Gilman and Office of Management and Budget Director Kevin Pawlos for committing this investment for our youth around the city and my colleagues on City Council for their anticipated support,” said Council President Kail-Smith. “I also want to thank our coaches, families and volunteers who are doing important work for our young people and strengthening our communities by giving them the opportunity to be part of a team and who will now have additional city resources to continue their great work.” | 29/6/2021 12:00:26 |

| City and Partners Launch Childcare Quality Fund to Support Childcare Facilities | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has announced the launch of their [Childcare Quality Fund](https://tryingtogether.org/child-care-quality-fund/), which will allow licensed childcare centers in the city to apply for grant funding for facility and program improvements. The funding will allow childcare facilities to implement strategic investments that can help improve their state Keystone STARS quality rating while minimizing incurred debt.  <br>The total funding for the program is $2 million and childcare businesses and non-profits are eligible to apply for funding based on their size. Family and group childcare homes are eligible for up to $12,500; childcare centers licensed for under 100 children are eligible for up to $25,000; and centers licensed for over 100 children are eligible for up to $50,000.  <br>Expenses eligible under the Childcare Quality Fund include facility improvements such as roof, window, HVAC, plumbing, flooring replacements, mold and lead testing and remediation, safety infrastructure like fire suppression systems, sprinklers and security cameras/systems, playground surfacing or equipment and fencing installation, repairs and retrofitting facilities to expand capacity.  <br>Childcare centers can also apply for program improvement expenses like curriculum materials, child assessment instruments, professional development, literacy, gross motor, art, STEM or dramatic play materials, child-sized furniture, child safety materials, hand washing sinks and other health and safety materials.  <br>The launch of the fund comes just after the City [announced the Childcare Reinvestment Business Fund (CRiB)](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/5028), administered by [Invest PGH](http://www.investpgh.org/) with generous funding from the PNC Foundation. This pilot program will provide loans between $5,000 and $20,000 for childcare businesses to assist with working capital expenses like payroll, enrollment subsidies, leasehold improvements, software, and other eligible business operations expenses.   <br>Childcare businesses are able to apply for assistance from both programs as the funding is specified for different uses. The main difference is that the Childcare Quality Fund grants are to be used to improve the quality of services and facilities while CRiB loans are to be used to pay for business operations. Additional information for both programs is available [here](https://tryingtogether.org/provider-application-info-2021/).   <br>The Childcare Quality Fund was developed in partnership between the Mayor’s Office of Equity, Pittsburgh City Council Women’s Caucus, Early Learning Resource Center Region 5, Allegheny County, Trying Together and the Alliance for Infants & Toddlers. Applications for the program will be managed by [Trying Together](https://tryingtogether.org/child-care-quality-fund/) and are available [here](https://alleghenycounty.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dcHUdWNfrP5QSrk). | 1/7/2021 10:54:42 |

| Office of Community Health and Safety Receives Grant for Neighborhood Health and Safety Academy Pilot | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 6, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s new Office of Community Health and Safety (OCHS) has received a $17,500 grant from the [Staunton Farm Foundation](https://www.stauntonfarm.org/) for the launch of their Neighborhood Health and Safety Academy pilot. This initiative aims to empower communities and neighbors with certifications, resources and skills to play an active role in providing for the wellness, health, safety, and wellbeing of their neighbors.  <br>While community members are intimately familiar with the needs of their neighbors and neighborhoods, knowing the most effective way to meet those needs can be a challenge. The Neighborhood Health and Safety Academy will be a two month training and education series for 20 residents to learn about the regional public safety and social service landscape so they are better equipped to identify and provide support in their communities. The majority of this grant funding will be used to provide stipends to selected attendees to reduce barriers to participation. <br>“Nobody knows the needs of our communities better than our community members,” said Mayor William Peduto. “The Neighborhood Health and Safety Academy will bring together community leaders to share what’s happening in their neighborhoods so we get a better sense of where they need support, but also will provide them the tools, resources, training and connections to services they need to help address neighborhood concerns.”  <br>Participants will learn about the public safety and health continuum of response to a wide range of issues. Educational trainings will focus on areas like housing, substance use, mental health, food security, violence prevention, police reform, criminal justice reform, homelessness, aging and youth. Each session will explore these topics from multiple angles by focusing on history, intersections of policy and practice, and a deep discussion of how each topic interfaces with poverty and systemic racism.  <br>Participants will also have access to free certifications and skills training in CPR, opioid overdose care, naloxone administration, mental health first aid, de-escalation, bleeding control, federal benefits application workshop, public housing application workshop, sexual assault survivor assistance, advocate training, financial empowerment, and motivational interviewing. <br>“Community members have made it clear that they want to have a more direct role in providing for the health, safety, and wellbeing of their neighbors,” said OCHS’ Overdose Prevention Coordinator, Joshua Schneider. “The Neighborhood Health and Safety Academy aims to help residents navigate systems  and  understand how to provide direct support to prevent crises.” <br>The Neighborhood Health and Safety Academy pilot is being designed based on feedback provided by the community through the City’s [EngagePGH platform](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/healthandsafetyacademy) to ensure course material and subject areas are relevant to what neighborhoods are experiencing and content will be guided by a board of community advisors. The 20 members of the Neighborhood Health and Safety Academy inaugural class will become community ambassadors that will continue to work with the Office of Community Health and Safety to address community needs and consult on future initiatives. <br>"Staunton Farm Foundation is committed to building healthy and thriving communities,” said Joni Schwager of Staunton Farm Foundation. “We are excited to support the Office of Community Health and Safety, Pittsburgh residents, and community-based trainers to promote safety and health for everyone." <br>About the Staunton Farm Foundation  <br>The Staunton Farm Foundation is dedicated to improving the lives of people who live with mental illness and substance use disorders. The Foundation works to enhance behavioral health treatment, support, and recovery through grant making to nonprofit organizations in 10 southwestern Pennsylvania counties (Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Washington, and Westmoreland). | 6/7/2021 12:05:07 |
| City of Pittsburgh Receives Grant to Support Civil Rights Historical Research in Manchester | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 6, 2021) — The City of Pittsburgh has received a $17,500 Keystone Historic Preservation Grant from the Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission to support civil rights historical research in the Manchester neighborhood to identify and commemorate people and places of historical significance or contribution to the Civil Rights Movement. <br>“This is an amazing opportunity for us to further explore one of Pittsburgh’s beloved historic neighborhoods,” said Director Andrew Dash. “We have received an outpouring of support from City Council members and local organizations like Preservation Pittsburgh and can’t wait to immerse ourselves in Manchester’s rich history.” <br>The Manchester Neighborhood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and was named a City Historic District in 1979. With this grant funding, the Department of City Planning will conduct additional research in the coming months to determine if the neighborhood or properties within the neighborhood could qualify for the National Parks Service’s African American Civil Rights Grants. This research includes recording oral histories from older neighborhood residents, pulling information from the City archive, and gathering other primary and secondary resources such as newspaper articles and photos. <br>"Many residents have families that have lived in Manchester for generations and have important stories to share, particularly as it relates to the Civil Rights Movement. This is a wonderful opportunity to capture their stories, preserve their memories, and celebrate the people who make up this community,” said Manchester Citizens Corporation’s Executive Director LaShawn Burton-Faulk. <br>Keystone Historic Preservation Grants, administered by the Pennsylvania Museum and Historical Commission, provide funding to support projects that identify, preserve, promote and protect historic resources in Pennsylvania that benefit the public and community revitalization. It also supports construction activities at resources listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The City is matching the grant amount to dedicate a total amount of $35,000 to this research.  <br>City Planning Contact: <br>Audrey Wells<br>Communications Specialist<br>Audrey.Wells@pittsburghpa.gov | 6/7/2021 13:32:20 |

| Governor Wolf Awards City Nearly $400,000 for Traffic Signal Improvement Projects | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 8, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure has been awarded over $398,000 for two traffic signal upgrade projects from Governor Wolf on behalf of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation’s Green Light-Go program. <br>Green Light-Go grants are intended to enhance mobility and efficiency within communities by improving existing traffic signals. DOMI received $266,000 to expand the city’s fiber optic network which will enhance communication between the city’s traffic signals and the city’s traffic management center, which is currently under design.  This will allow the City to provide more responsive service by being able to assess and revise traffic signal timings from a remote location. <br>The East End Signal Retiming Project was awarded $132,000 for the study of existing signal timing and phasing for approximately 50 traffic signals in the East Liberty, Point Breeze, Shadyside, Bloomfield and Friendship neighborhoods. This study will analyze and provide recommendations for adjusted vehicular signal timings, pedestrian signal timings and signal operations which will improve performance and safety for all users.  Improved signal timings also reduce car idling times and emissions.  <br>More information about the grant program can be found [here](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-announces-over-15-million-in-green-light-go-grant-funds-to-improve-traffic-safety/). | 8/7/2021 11:17:11 |

| Pittsburgh Launches Innovative Mobility and Equity Initiatives Move PGH and Universal Basic Mobility | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 9, 2021) Mayor William Peduto joined the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) and partners today in launching Move PGH – a first of its kind Mobility as a Service (MaaS) system. Move PGH integrates transit and shared mobility in both physical and digital “mobility hubs” making multimodal travel in the city easy and convenient.  <br>This new system of integrated services enables the second program, a “Universal Basic Mobility” pilot, which will provide up to 100 local low-income residents with monthly transit subscriptions and shared mobility services to address mobility insecurity.  <br>Both programs support the City’s equity principles that all Pittsburghers can easily access fresh food, afford basic transportation and safe travel without reliance on a vehicle.  <br>"Transportation mobility is key to economic mobility and a major determinant in household health, education, and welfare. In Pittsburgh, too many residents are one missed bus or one flat tire away from losing their job or missing a critical appointment,” said Mayor Peduto. “Universal Basic Mobility, using the services of Move PGH, will demonstrate that when people have a readily available transportation back-up plan they are able to access more opportunities and climb the economic ladder.” <br>Move PGH is the first integrated MaaS project in the U.S. to connect traditional and emerging low-cost, shared transportation options into a single, easy to use system. Travelers can find a bus, bike, scooter, moped, car or shared ride using the [Transit](https://transitapp.com/) app or by visiting one of the 50 new mobility hubs throughout the city.  <br>The two initiatives are the result of more than two years of work by a unique public-private-nonprofit partnership. Led by DOMI and built around existing foundational systems of public transit and bike share, Move PGH integrates a coalition of existing and new “last mile” service providers organized by Spin including:  <br>- A new fleet of shared low-speed electric scooters provided by [Spin](http://www.spin.app/)<br>- Expanded carshare services provided by [Zipcar](http://www.zipcar.com/pittsburgh)<br>- A fleet of electric mopeds by [Scoobi](http://www.scoobi.co/)<br>- Carpool matching and commuting services facilitated through [Waze Carpool](http://www.waze.com/carpool/cities/US/Pittsburgh)<br>- Electric charging for e-scooters provided by [Swiftmile](http://swiftmile.com/)<br>- Real time transit and mobility information on [TransitScreens](http://transitscreen.com/) at mobility hubs <br>- Trip planning and most trip booking available through [Transit](http://transitapp.com/)<br>In addition to improving transportation flexibility and resiliency for the general public, the Move PGH Universal Basic Mobility demonstration will specifically test if reliable access to transit and a range of shared mobility options improves employment and health outcomes for low-income workers and their households.  <br>Grant funding will cover the cost of monthly subscriptions to Move PGH partner services for 100 low-income individuals for six months. The Manchester Citizens Corporation will further support these individuals with “trip coaching” to ensure they know how to use the various services. Spin is providing funding to researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and will also be working with [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/) to evaluate the demonstration to potentially serve as a national model.  <br>Move PGH and the Universal Basic Mobility demonstration are funded by the Richard King Mellon Foundation and Spin, in partnership with InnovatePGH.  <br>**Additional Comments from Move PGH Partners:**<br>**Bike Share Pittsburgh, Healthy Ride**<br>“Healthy Ride has had the honor of working with Pittsburgh communities for the past six years to build a more equitable bike share program,” said David White, Executive Director, Bike Share Pittsburgh. “We’ve more than doubled our network while prioritizing marginalized communities, established a Community Coalition of partners who inform major organizational decisions, and are re-building our system in 2022 to include e-bikes that will make it easier for more people to utilize bikes to get around. Pittsburghers deserve more ways to get around, and we’re excited to be a part of this inclusive network of services. <br>**InnovatePGH**<br>“InnovatePGH’s mission to accelerate Pittsburgh’s standing as a global innovation hub requires exactly the type of next-generation mobility solutions provided by Move PGH; we are thrilled to be a member of the coalition,” said Sean Luther, Executive Director of InnovatePGH. “As the fiscal sponsor for this exciting public/private partnership, we are particularly grateful to the R.K. Mellon Foundation and the New Urban Mobility Alliance, whose generosity will make getting around our city easier and more joyful for all Pittsburghers.” <br>**New Urban Mobility Alliance (NUMO)**<br>“NUMO strongly supports innovative and inclusive public-private partnerships like Move PGH,” said Harriet Tregoning, Director of NUMO, “which is unique in its approach to improve access to mobility for Pittsburgh residents by bringing private new mobility services, city agencies and the broader community together. Tackling systemic transportation inequities means addressing how lack of access to transportation options limits access to jobs, inhibits economic mobility and makes it challenging for residents to get where they need to go safely, conveniently and affordably. With the launch of the city’s mobility hub network, and collaborating with public transit, bike share and a diverse suite of mobility services options, Pittsburgh is demonstrating its commitment to building an integrated, multimodal transportation system that is accessible to all and can lead to more equitable outcomes.”<br>**Port Authority**<br>"Real accessibility means having the freedom to go where you want to go and the ability to get there," said Port Authority CEO Katharine Kelleman. "Port Authority is proud to provide the access, and we're excited for Move PGH, together with Transit, to offer the options. We may be the primary agency that moves our region forward, but we're happy that our riders have so many other reliable transit options that allow them to be able to access our region. <br>**Scoobi**<br>“We’re looking forward to the addition of new electric form factors and other mobility providers  improving local transportation systems through this collaborative effort to reduce roadway congestion and carbon emissions as Pittsburgh continues its transformation into a more sustainable City,” stated Scoobi Founder, Michael Moran.  “We’re also excited to announce the pending launch of our reengineered mobile app, a 50% increase of our vehicle fleet with the addition of new service areas, and a number programs to increase mobility access to underserved neighborhoods.” <br>**Spin**<br>"Making mobility cleaner, more equitable, and more reliable is central to Spin's mission; participating in this first-of-its-kind project gets us that much closer,” said Ben Bear, CEO of Spin. “As a Pittsburgh native, it's been rewarding to be able to launch our pilot, and watch this project come to fruition giving residents a suite of options making it as easy to get around without a car as it is with a car. What I’m most proud of is that the City is pioneering a universal basic mobility pilot that will give a group of low-income residents access to Move PGH. We hope Move PGH can become a model for how micromobility operators can collaborate with cities and other mobility companies to better serve the public."<br>**Transit**<br>“Bringing multiple mobility options together for better trips is what Transit does best, and we’re excited to be part of the City’s launch of Move PGH,” said David Block-Schachter, Chief Business Officer at Transit. “Move PGH brought together all the mobility options available in Pittsburgh, and with the addition of Mobility Hub locations directly on our map, Pittsburghers have everything they need to get the most out of Move PGH.” <br>**Waze Carpool**<br>“The City of Pittsburgh is helping to create a more mobile, equitable and safe environment for its residents, which is why Waze is excited to partner on the launch of Move PGH. At Waze, we are committed to ending traffic together, and we could not do that without the support of cities like Pittsburgh,” said Adam Fried, Head of Global Partnerships at Waze. “Waze Carpool makes it easy and fun for Wazers to commute together, saving Pittsburghers time and money. Drivers and riders with similar origins and destinations in Pittsburgh will be matched, helping to reduce strain on the roads and the environment throughout the city.” <br>**Zipcar**<br>“Zipcar is proud to be part of Pittsburgh’s coalition of transportation providers, expanding access to mobility for Pittsburgh residents,” said Justin Holmes, Vice President, Marketing and Public Policy, Zipcar. “We are dedicated to providing convenient and affordable mobility solutions to the city, especially to those without easy access to vehicles or alternative modes of transportation. Whether it be for essential trips or travel beyond the city limits to see family and friends, Zipcar is here to support.” | 8/7/2021 17:42:21 |

| Pittsburgh Police and Office of Community Health and Safety Selected to Develop Crisis Response and Intervention Team Co-Response Model | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 12, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Office of Community Health and Safety (OCHS) and Bureau of Police have been awarded a Crisis Response and Intervention Team (CRIT) technical assistance and training grant from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Administration to further develop an effective model for police to identify what co-responders can best help in emergency situations.  <br>As the City expands its program of co-response to ensure those experiencing behavioral health conditions, like mental health and substance use, and intellectual and development disabilities receive appropriate support for emergency calls, the CRIT program will further equip police officers to call in the right co-responders who can make appropriate referrals. The initiative will increase police’s access to training, technical assistance and other resources to develop and deliver multilayered approaches for people whose needs are outside the realm of traditional law enforcement.  <br>Through this program police will have support to strategically plan crisis response teams, expand relationships with support services and community-based resources, train officers and partners and develop a co-responder academy from national subject matter experts and local partners. <br>"As the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police partners with OCHS to develop co-response, alternative response, diversion and enhanced recruit and officer training, it is essential that officers who are dispatched to calls involving people experiencing mental health, substance use and other challenges are well-supported and trained to safely and compassionately address needs,” said Pittsburgh Police Academy Sergeant Colleen Bristow. <br>OCHS and Police aim to use this opportunity for the following goals: <br>- Police officers and crisis response teams will be able to recognize individuals in crisis, or at risk of experiencing crisis. <br>- Police crisis response teams will ensure that people experiencing a crisis are given proper care, time, and referrals, including the sub-dispatch of right responders. <br>- Police and partners will have meaningful relationships to ensure that individuals with behavioral health conditions and/or intellectual and development disabilities are connected to resources or aid and diverted from the criminal legal system. <br>- The safety for all community members is the top priority for police and staff. <br>“The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is committed to ensuring safer and more supportive interactions with people experiencing mental health challenges and the development of crisis response policy and practice that benefits community stakeholders in general,” said Police Employee Wellness and Resource coordinator Officer Matt Schlick.  <br>Pittsburgh was one of three cities selected to be a part of this Bureau of Justice Assistance’s [Academic Training to Inform Police Responses](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theiacp.org%2Fprojects%2Facademic-training-to-inform-police-responses&data=04%7C01%7Cmelanie.ondek%40pittsburghpa.gov%7Ccdc01d1b61b64fdcd9da08d921d507a0%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C0%7C637578021121122370%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=4d%2BRgmXw9Btj1SLwVqy3yXRI3%2F2gac%2BxBUn%2BYSwk7is%3D&reserved=0) initiative and the only city selected for enhanced technical assistance.

| Mayor William Peduto's Public Schedule - Tuesday, July 13, 2021 | **Global Covenant of Mayors Board Meeting**<br>Time: 8 a.m.<br>**Upper Hill Housing Development Walking Tour with Pittsburgh Housing Development Corporation and Schenley Heights Collaborative**<br>Time: 2 p.m. | 13/7/2021 08:55:35 |
| City, Pittsburgh Housing Development Corporation and Partners Showcase Affordable Housing Development Projects in the Upper Hill District Neighborhood | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 13, 2021) Mayor William Peduto joined other elected officials and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Pittsburgh Housing Development Corporation (PHDC) and Schenley Heights Collaborative (SHC) for a walking tour of PHDC’s home rehabilitation projects in the Upper Hill District. The tour featured 15 homes along Anaheim, Cherokee, Camp and Shawnee Streets and Bryn Mawr Road.  <br>PHDC has been working with SHC, a local community group, to identify and complete housing projects in the Upper Hill to preserve a balance of market rate homes, rental units and for-sale houses affordable to residents at or below 120% of the area median income (AMI). In total, the PHDC has developed 21 affordable homes in the Upper Hill investing $4.6 million, with current plans for an additional 11 units in the neighborhood.  <br>“The work of the PHDC and the SHC on these projects shows how we can be successful in creating opportunity and meeting our neighborhoods’ needs when the community can work with government agencies to realize their vision,” said Mayor Peduto. “We have been able to put the community in the driver’s seat to develop affordable options in their neighborhood and creating opportunities for new homeowners who are now invested in the future of their neighborhood. This builds wealth, pride and continued investment in our communities.” <br>An affiliate organization of the URA, PHDC was created in 1994 to develop housing in neighborhoods that were underserved by private development markets. PHDC operates in low-to-moderate income areas to serve low-to-moderate income homebuyers to help build wealth and investment in neighborhoods. The PHDC has developed or assisted in developing nearly 300 units of affordable housing and has invested $68 million in housing in City of Pittsburgh neighborhoods.  <br>“Homeownership is the primary way families can pass on generational wealth, yet there are many challenges to providing affordable housing, such as construction costs and affordability gaps,” PHDC Deputy Executive Director Richard Snipe said. “Through strong and committed partnerships with Lowes and Home Depot, and creativity in acquiring housing stock that can be rehabilitated, PHDC has been able to address these challenges. Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the pride in the face of a client who is now a homeowner – a dream they never thought possible.”   <br>Today’s walking tour showcased only a sampling of the PHDC homes in the Hill District. Financial support for these projects was provided by Dollar Bank, First Commonwealth Bank, Neighborhood Allies and the Heinz Endowments, with the support of Mayor Peduto, Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle, State Senator Wayne Fontana, State Representative Jake Wheatley Jr. and Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. Developments are also made possible through strong and committed partnerships with Lowes, Home Depot and IKEA.  <br>Currently, PHDC has seven units under construction (two pre-sold) and 24 units in predevelopment citywide. To learn more, visit [phdchomes.org](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ura.org%2Fpages%2Fpittsburgh-housing-development-corporation&data=04%7C01%7Cmolly.onufer%40pittsburghpa.gov%7C389d231c52464156f3f308d9424442fc%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C1%7C637613683232727943%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000&sdata=Y9jiN4HG53AxIGnCnfTNmHI7sOEUAkEsaF3mMNnAYxM%3D&reserved=0). | 13/7/2021 12:10:53 |
| City Seeking Historic Restoration Specialty Contractors for Neill Log House in Schenley Park | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 14, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Office of Management and Budget Procurement Division has announced a specialized request for qualifications (RFQ) has been released for the stabilization and restoration of the Neill Log House in Schenley Park, the oldest domestic structure in the City of Pittsburgh.   <br>The Neill Log House is a designated Pittsburgh Historic Landmark. Though sources vary as to the exact date of its construction, the most common belief is that Robert Neill constructed the cabin shortly after 1787. It changed ownership throughout the nineteenth century before it was donated to the City of Pittsburgh along with 300 acres of land by Mary Croghan Schenley. Schenley Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br>The preservation and stabilization of the historic structure will require firms that specialize in the restoration of log houses per U.S. Secretary of the Interior standards, so the City of Pittsburgh is seeking RFQs to gauge interest and establish a pool of contractors with the necessary expertise to complete projects on the house. No work will be awarded as a result of this RFQ, but vendors who respond would have the opportunity to bid for work if or when the City solicits specific preservation projects for Neill Log House.   <br>Management of the restoration will be led by the Department of Public Works with the support of community and local historic preservation partners. More information about the RFQ is available [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14891_Neill_Log_House_RFQ.pdf). Interested firms must submit a statement of qualification to daniel.tobin@pittsburghpa.gov by August 21, 2021.<br>[![photo from 1900 of Neill Log House on a hill with horse and man at the bottom of the hill](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14892_Neill_Log_House_1900s.jpg)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14892_Neill_Log_House_1900s.jpg)<br>Neill Log House, early 1900s<br>![Neill Log House in present day with snow around the log house](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14893_Neill_Log_House.jpg)<br>Neill Log House, recent | 14/7/2021 12:12:47 |

| City Accelerator Initiative Receives 2021 HUD Secretary's Award for Public-Private Partnerships | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 15, 2021) The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Council on Foundations have recognized the Citi Foundation and Living Cities for the 2021 Secretary’s Award for Public-Philanthropic Partnerships for launching the “City Accelerator” initiative. The City of Pittsburgh is one of the U.S. cities participating in the City Accelerator.  <br>The City Accelerator initiative competitively selects cities to receive flexible financial resources and technical expertise to test specific administrative, financial, political or cultural innovation efforts that produce stronger outcomes for residents and help cities run more efficiently, effectively, and equitably. <br>The City of Pittsburgh is one of 10 U.S. cities participating in the inclusive procurement cohort and one of 27 U.S. cities that have been selected to participate in the City Accelerator since it started in 2014. Through its participation in the City Accelerator for inclusive procurement, the City has changed its procurement systems to better meet the needs of local businesses owned by women and people of color when they do business with the City. The City has:  <br>- [Implemented](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3678) a 12-month procurement forecasting system called the [Buying Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html) so small businesses can view upcoming contracting opportunities from all city departments and authorities in one centralized place and have more time to prepare or plan their proposals. <br>  <br>- Shortened the time between when a contract is awarded and executed, which further helps small businesses plan for income from contracts and the labor and other costs they would need to complete their work.<br>  <br>- [Launched](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4285) “Contract Connections: Bids for PGH,” a remote training series to help local, diverse small businesses learn how to participate in the City and other agencies’ procurement processes. <br>  <br>“I’d like to congratulate the Citi Foundation and Living Cities for this well-deserved recognition for helping cities create systems and processes that promote equity and efficiency across the nation,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Pittsburgh has benefitted from the opportunity to change our procurement systems to meet the needs of our minority- and women-owned businesses. When minority- and women-owned businesses can get city contracts, our money is invested equitably into our communities and strengthens our local economy.” <br>If the racial wealth gap were eliminated, it is estimated that tax revenues could increase by up to $325 billion for state and local governments, and the national GDP could rise by 22 percent. Government contracts have long served as a springboard for business growth for white owned businesses – including some leading U.S. businesses – and over the past fifty years, government procurement has evolved as a critical tool in addressing our nation’s history of economic exclusion by promoting diverse business formation and growth across the United States.  <br>“This award is a testament to our collective responsiveness to the needs of cities. As the City Accelerator expanded to 20 more cities in 2016, we learned that cities could not achieve improved economic opportunity for all without applying a racial equity lens to our work, ” said Living Cities CEO and President Ben Hecht.  <br>The Secretary’s Award for Public-Philanthropic Partnerships recognizes excellence in partnerships that have both transformed the relationships between the government and philanthropy sectors and led to measurable benefits in housing and community development, including increased economic development, health, safety, and education for low-income families across the country. This award is a testament to the cross-sector relationships developed through the City Accelerator between 27 unique U.S. cities, Living Cities, and Citi Foundation. | 15/7/2021 10:14:23 |

| City Installs Safe Connector Path for Pedestrians and Bicyclists in Lawrenceville | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 20, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure announced today the installation of the [Hatfield Connector](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14408_Hatfield_Connector.pdf), the final portion of the Central Lawrenceville Neighborway. The connector is a shared-use pedestrian and bike path that closes the pedestrian and bicycle path gap between 50th and 51st Streets.  <br>[Neighborways](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/neighborways) are low-traffic streets that prioritize pedestrians, bicycles and other non-vehicular traffic to offer a safer, more comfortable alternative to busy arterial streets. Sometimes, Neighborways create connections for bicyclists and pedestrians by creating ramps or trails on the public right of way.  <br>The Hatfield Connector was constructed by the Department of Public Works’ Construction Division through an old City right of way and extends from 50th to 51st, closing a crucial gap in the bike network between the Central Lawrenceville Neighborway (on Foster, 44th and Hatfield) and Upper Lawrenceville and Stanton Heights. <br>“It is always exciting to see an idea from a community meeting or community plan advance to a real life project,” said Lauren Byrne Connelly, Executive Director for Lawrenceville Corporation. “The Neighborway, and its improved infrastructure along Willow, Hatfield, and now through the connector, provides a critical connection for pedestrians, bicyclists, and others looking for safe and accessible routes to and through the Lawrenceville community. A healthy community is one where leaders can plan and implement both short- and long-term infrastructure & policy improvements that enhance the safety and livability of our neighborhood, and we are appreciative to the City for working with us to create a safe and accessible Lawrenceville.” <br>The construction included grading and paving the 10-foot path, constructing modular block walls, installing new sidewalk ramps and includes a long tree pit on 51st Street and sodding of the adjacent land. The City will be installing bollards, railings, signage and planting additional trees. <br>BEFORE:<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14943_Spirit_Connector_4.jpg)<br>AFTER:<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14942_Spirit_Connector_1.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14944_Spirit_Connector_2.jpg) | 20/7/2021 11:04:52 |
| Mayor Peduto Signs Executive Order Calling for City Youth Bullying Prevention Policy | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 21, 2021) Mayor William Peduto signed an Executive Order today for the development and implementation of a Youth Bullying Prevention Policy to cover all youth-focused programming provided by the City of Pittsburgh.  <br>"The City offers our youngest residents opportunities to play sports, engage in career exploration, build skills and express their creativity,” said Mayor Peduto. “Today, we reaffirm our commitment as a city to providing kids with safe and healthy spaces to be themselves no matter who they are, how they identify, how they choose to express themselves or where they come from. Bullying has a dangerous impact on the mental and physical health of our youngest residents. These harmful actions have no place in Pittsburgh, and my Executive Order represents a major step toward preventing and responding to bullying incidents in city facilities."  <br>The Executive Order directs city departments that work with young people to develop a unified anti-bullying policy to create safe space for young people in city facilities, particularly those of protected classes who may be more vulnerable to bullying. Being bullied can lead to increased feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, loss of interest and absence from school or programs. Data shows that children with disabilities, immigrant children, children of color and LGBTQIA+ youth are much more likely to be bullied and verbally harassed. <br>The order also calls for the ongoing training of staff to recognize and mitigate bullying as well as help cultivate better understanding of youth experiencing bullying such as Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Gender Expression (SOGIE) training.  <br>Mayor Peduto has called for the Departments of Parks and Recreation, Human Resourves and Civil Service and Public Safety to develop and publicize the Youth Bullying Prevention Policy and share with external partners to develop similar policies.  <br>A full copy of the Executive Order is available [here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14951_FINAL_Mayor_Executive_Order_Youth_Bullying_Prevention_Policy.pdf). | 21/7/2021 09:15:35 |

| PWSA Receives Nearly $24 Million State Wastewater Infrastructure Low-Interest Loan for Sewer Line Repairs | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 26, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has announced that the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) has been awarded a $23,970,000 low-interest loan from the Pennsylvania Investment Authority (PENNVEST) for wastewater infrastructure repairs. This funding will jump-start critical work that is needed to strengthen the sewer system and provide PWSA ratepayers with safer, more reliable wastewater services. <br>PWSA will use the funding to repair approximately 22 miles of sewer collection lines in Homewood, Squirrel Hill, Marshall-Shadeland, Spring Garden, Highland Park and Carrick. The project will aid in the elimination of sewage overflows and reduce infiltration into the collection lines. <br>“I’d like to thank Governor Wolf for this investment in Pittsburgh’s infrastructure,” said Mayor William Peduto. “We have inherited an infrastructure system that is aging and not equipped to handle the stresses our region has been experiencing. This funding will allow PWSA to continue their work of creating a safe, clean water system that works for our communities.” <br>“We are thankful for the support of the PENNVEST Board, Governor Wolf, Mayor Peduto, and our city and state legislative leaders for recognizing the essential work that is needed to strengthen our sewer system,” said Will Pickering, PWSA’s Chief Executive Officer. “The intense and frequent storms we’ve experienced this summer have elevated the need to rehabilitate aging sewer lines throughout Pittsburgh. This infusion of state funding will save ratepayers approximately $16 million in comparison to traditional municipal financing."<br>This project was one of four projects selected statewide for wastewater infrastructure improvements and is funded through the Clean Water State Revolving Funds and PENNVEST.

| City of Pittsburgh and City of Dortmund, Germany Selected for International Urban and Regional Cooperation Sustainable Agriculture Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 27, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh and Dortmund, Germany have been selected as partner participants in the International Urban and Regional Cooperation (IURC) Program. The cities will work together to share information and develop localized policy as part of the Sustainable Agriculture: Food Systems, Urban Gardens cluster.  <br>The program provides the opportunity for cities to collaborate and share information on municipal policies, programs and initiatives related to sustainable food systems for up to two years.

We have a lot to share and a lot to learn for addressing the resilience of local food systems.”  <br>Pittsburgh and Dortmund are cities that share an industrial past and have previously worked together on climate, sustainability and resilience exchanges. The City’s work in urban agriculture and food systems includes the Pittsburgh Food Policy Council and adopting the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger. Dortmund, like many European cities, is working to grow and produce closer to their population center.  <br>The partnership was made possible through the Sister Cities Association of Pittsburgh (SCAP), who develops, maintains and expands current and future Sister City relationships to bring cities together to address and solve global challenges facing cities of tomorrow to benefit our region’s economic, educational and cultural sectors. Though Pittsburgh and Dortmund are not sister cities, SCAP has worked to connect the two cities for other policy exchange initiatives. Pittsburgh is currently working with six of its Sister Cities to develop localized policy solutions to goals in the EU Green Deal, New Urban Agenda, Agenda 2030 and the European Cohesion Policy.

| City of Pittsburgh Releases Finalized Neighborhood Plan Guide | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 29, 2021) — In collaboration with public agencies and community planning partners, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning has released a finalized [Neighborhood Plan Guide](https://npg.pittsburghpa.gov/). The guide establishes a process for bringing together community stakeholders to create high-quality and consistent neighborhood plans and outlines a set of standards that plans must meet to be adopted by the City’s Planning Commission and become city policy. <br>The Neighborhood Plan Guide lays out how public agencies, Registered Community Organizations (RCOs), and the public work together to create strategic plans for neighborhoods throughout the city, including the framework and phases needed to make sure neighborhood plans can be formally adopted by the Planning Commission. Plans that are formally adopted by the Planning Commission become official City of Pittsburgh policy and guide public investments in the neighborhood, including capital budget decisions, over the next 10 or more years until updated.  <br>The Neighborhood Plan Guide was created based on experiences with the Uptown, Hazelwood, Manchester-Chateau, and Homewood neighborhood plans as well as comments from partner agencies, community stakeholders, and the general public. In the drafting process, over 500 comments were received and addressed in the guide’s three drafts. Some of the changes implemented as a result of public comment include: <br>- Focusing on equity and inclusion in the planning process <br>- Including the EcoDistricts Protocol and the P4 framework <br>- Clarifying roles for Steering Committees, Action Teams, and Technical Advisory Groups <br>- Adding steps to the process that address existing plans and studies<br>- Explaining mandatory versus optional neighborhood plan topics <br>The Neighborhood Plan Guide was presented to the Planning Commission in March 2020. After the presentation and public testimony, the Neighborhood Plan Guide was approved. After this approval, the City partnered with local design agency Fireman Creative to create interactive online and print materials to improve the experience of those using the guide.  <br>“The Neighborhood Plan Guide is the culmination of years of work to empower communities to take a proactive role in their community’s future,” said City Planning Director Andrew Dash. “Over the last decade, we’ve learned that this empowerment can only happen through collaboration and dialogue and we now have a tool that will guide us through the planning process.” <br>Neighborhood Plans are created in five phases: organize, visualize, strategize, formalize, and realize. The guide includes an overview and guidance for each phase as well as resources to support planning teams throughout the process.  <br>The interactive online guide can be found [here](https://npg.pittsburghpa.gov/).<br>Contact: <br>Audrey Wells <br>Communications Specialist <br>Department of City Planning <br>Audrey.Wells@pittsburghpa.gov | 29/7/2021 11:48:10 |

| Department of Energy Awards $3.8 Million Grant to Develop Zero Emissions Curbside Management Model to Benefit Businesses and Environment in Pittsburgh | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 5, 2021) The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) has announced that the U.S. Department of Energy has awarded a 3-year $3.8 million grant to advance zero emissions delivery, study curb use in business districts and implement technologies and policies that accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption by commercial fleets. Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and Santa Monica were the only three cities awarded the inaugural grant to conduct research and create models that other cities can use. <br>The proposal, led by the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator in partnership with the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, Automotus, Carnegie Mellon University, DOMI and others, will expand Pittsburgh’s [curbside parking pilot](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4565). It will deploy around 150 additional “smart loading zone” cameras in areas with high concentrations of vehicle traffic, restaurants and small businesses, starting with Downtown, Lawrenceville and Oakland. The cameras will gather data on the types of activities happening curbside like parcel delivery, food delivery, ride-hailing, patron parking, bus riding or other activities and measure which of these vehicles are electric or combustion engines.  <br>Newly collected data will be analyzed to see what vehicles are using the curbside for what purpose to determine policies that can enhance the safety and efficiency of parking, traffic flow and incentivize the use of electric vehicles. In the first phase of this project, DOMI will be working with local business organizations, restaurants, small businesses and other community stakeholders to pilot dedicated smart loading zone areas for curbside takeout and delivery services. These zones will enable streamline pick-ups and drop-offs and reduce double-parking and fuel emissions from idling vehicles.  <br>This is the first federal grant of its kind to accelerate emission reductions by leveraging curbside management policies and technologies and will serve as a blueprint to cities nationwide. With the increase of curbside services for businesses, cities are looking towards new technologies for ways to reduce traffic congestion, reduce emissions to improve air quality, increase equitable access to business districts and adapt curbside management practices to emerging services. | 5/8/2021 15:36:11 |

| URA Seeking Proposals to Develop Community Plans for Chartiers and Perrysville Business Districts in Avenues of Hope Corridors | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 12, 2021) Mayor William Peduto has announced that the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) is requesting proposals to develop community-based plans to assist in the redevelopment of the Chartiers and Perrysville business districts as part of the [Avenues of Hope initiative](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4380).  <br>The URA is seeking the services from planning, economic development and commercial market professionals to conduct strategic business district planning for the Chartiers, Perrysville/Five Points and Perrysville/Charles business districts.  <br>“Successful development and revitalization fulfills the local community’s vision for their neighborhood,” said Mayor Peduto. “Since these three areas lack written business district plans, we need to work with residents and businesses to create them so that we can drive investment into what the community wants to see on these avenues.”   <br>Those selected will support the inclusive redevelopment of these business districts by developing strategies for each of the corridors by:  <br>- Working with URA staff and stakeholders to collect data for the corridor, including properties, business mix, public safety statistics and rental rates.  <br>- Reviewing market data to determine potential business mix.  <br>- Meeting with existing businesses and community stakeholders to gather information, determine community preferences in terms of business mix and development priorities and get feedback on proposed recommendations.  <br>- Developing recommendations for the implementation of the plan.   <br>"One of the critical aspects of the Avenues of Hope initiative is to have a complete picture of the potential of each of the corridors and to work with the community to determine development priorities. This process will help us to achieve that goal," URA Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker said. <br>These plans will lay out the needs and wants of the community and be used to identify and guide investments in these business districts. Once priorities are defined, the URA, through the Avenues of Hope initiative, can assist with recruiting developers, businesses, entrepreneurs and organizations as well as provide funding resources to invest in revitalizing the corridors based on the community’s vision.  <br>“I want to thank Mayor Peduto, Executive Director Flisram and Deputy Executive Director Walker for identifying the need for economic development for all of Chartiers Avenue from West End to Windgap-Chartiers City,” said City Council President Theresa Kail-Smith. “Our residents want to see new businesses, jobs, entertainment and opportunities in their neighborhoods and we look forward to attracting investment in District 2.” <br>“Small business districts are the beating heart of our neighborhoods, not only offering goods and services, but a place for the community to gather,” said District 1 City Councilman Bobby Wilson. “I’m so glad to see this much needed investment in our Perrysville Ave corridor, supporting existing business owners and bringing more storefronts to the neighborhood. This investment is also an important complement to the affordable housing and housing stabilization efforts of the Observatory Hill and Perry Hilltop communities.” <br>“Both creating and reestablishing parts of Perrysville Ave as a strong business corridor is critical to the long term health of the North Side,” said District 6 City Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle. “In doing so, it is also critical to center minority businesses thus ensuring a diverse and vibrant community for decades to come. This first step of bringing on consultants to help with the strategic planning is important to ensuring our collective vision being realized.” <br>Multiple awards may be made for this project and respondents can choose to focus on all three or may choose to focus on only one or two. The request for proposals (RFP) will open tomorrow, August 13, and can be found on the URA’s [proposals and bids webpage](https://www.ura.org/pages/proposals-bids). Proposals are due September 10, 2021.  <br>[Avenues of Hope](https://www.ura.org/pages/avenues-of-hope) is a place-based, people-first initiative that focuses on revitalizing seven major business corridors in Black and diverse neighborhoods through targeted investment in residents, businesses, entrepreneurs and housing to support inclusive growth of the neighborhoods. | 12/8/2021 10:29:48 |

| Blue Recycling Bin Distribution Phase 3 to Begin August 17 | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 12, 2021) Mayor William Peduto today announced that the Department of Public Works Environmental Services Division will begin phase 3 of its distribution of 32-gallon blue curbside recycling bins to city residents on August 17. The distribution program is part of a transition away from a bag-based recycling program into a bin-based collection method. <br>The Blue Bin Rollout program began in the [fall of 2020](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4412). Over a two-year period, the City of Pittsburgh is distributing over 100,000 blue recycling bins to those they service – single family homes, duplexes and apartment buildings with five or fewer units – with a goal of becoming BAG FREE BY ‘23.  <br>This third phase will serve homes in the remaining central and eastern neighborhoods. Residents of southern, western and northern neighborhoods will receive bins in 2022 and can find a timeline for their neighborhood [here](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/recycling-blue-bins).  <br>“The City of Pittsburgh is now offering residents a method that makes it easy for people to create the habit of single-stream recycling, which allows residents to combine all recyclable materials in one container,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Blue bins offer many advantages such as saving on costs for both residents and the City, providing high-value recyclables to the circular economy and cutting contamination.” <br>Prior to receiving the new recycling bins, residents will receive notification via U.S. Mail announcing when to anticipate the arrival of their new blue curbside recycling containers, along with information on what can and cannot be placed in the bin. <br>Rehrig Pacific Company – which is manufacturing the bins in Pennsylvania – will deliver a 32-gallon blue recycling bin with tight-fitting lid to each designated residence. Each bin will come with an information packet describing its proper use, and each bin will be scanned and linked to a specific address. Up to two 18-gallon totes are available as an alternative for medical exemption. Qualifying individuals must contact 311 City Response Center to request totes. <br>When using the blue bins, residents must loosely place recyclables in the bins without plastic bags, which can jam up equipment at processing facilities. Residents can deposit into the bins glass and plastic bottles, jugs and jars (lids removed), aluminum and steel cans, and mixed paper. Clean cardboard must be flattened, boxed and placed next to the bin. <br>A series of webinars on how to recycle correctly with the City of Pittsburgh were hosted earlier this year and a video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=23&v=H2nP3MVKRwc&feature=emb_logo). Residents can learn more about the Blue Bin Rollout program and recycling in the City of Pittsburgh by visiting the [website](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/recycling-blue-bins) or by contacting 311.  <br>Funding for the Blue Bin Rollout is provided in part by grants from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, The Recycling Partnership and Mayor Peduto's commitment to move the city toward zero waste. | 12/8/2021 11:08:55 |
| Office of Community Health and Safety Launches New Website | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 12, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s newest office, the Office of Community Health and Safety (OCH&S), has launched a new website with information and interactive tools focused on people-centered programs, equity, justice and harm reduction that address individuals’ health and safety needs.  <br>OCH&S is developing programs guided by evidence-based practices and community input. This includes hiring social workers, outreach workers and other professionals who can assist individuals and first responders in situations that require longer-term support like those involving mental and behavioral health conditions, homelessness and substance use.  <br>OCH&S’ new website includes:  <br>- Social service navigation information and additional resources  <br>- Nationally-recognized Opioid Overdose Dashboard used to identify and address trends in overdose prevention and harm reduction strategies  <br>- Job postings for open OCH&S positions  <br>- Information about the Neighborhood Health and Safety Academy  <br>- Public Service Announcements (PSAs), such as [this latest one](https://pittsburghpa.gov/ochs/announcements-press-releases) about the heightened risk of fentanyl exposure and overdose risk for people who use drugs <br>The website can be found [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/ochs/index.html) and additional questions can be directed to ochspgh@pittsburghpa.gov. | 12/8/2021 10:06:26 |
| City Launches New Comprehensive Parks and Trails Website | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 13, 2021) Today, the City of Pittsburgh Office of Mayor William Peduto, Departments of Innovation & Performance (I&P), Parks & Recreation, and Public Works have launched CitiParks, the city’s first official comprehensive and interactive public parks and trails website.  <br>The CitiParks website was created by the I&P GIS & Communications team and provides detailed interactive maps, historical information, attractions, shelter information, public art, amenities and more for our five Allegheny Regional Asset District parks (Schenley, Frick, Riverview, Emerald View, and Highland Parks). The site also features information and resources on the city’s 10 Community Parks, riverfronts, and 150 Neighborhood Parks. I&P’s Applications team has mapped over 130 miles of trails using a high accuracy GPS unit to compile the first ever comprehensive trail map of Pittsburgh that includes trails in parks, greenways, and riverfront trails.  <br>The trails are categorized by difficulty and display elevation information to give the public a resource to plan their trips. This data will also be used internally for planning, maintenance, and public safety purposes. <br>“This critical information had been missing for far too long,” said Mayor Peduto. “We have always known the social, health and economic impacts of having access to park and recreation space, but during the pandemic, we all saw firsthand how much we relied on our parks. Now, we’re able to provide the people of Pittsburgh with a place to learn about their parks like never before.” <br>The website combines the new features and tools with all existing relevant park information in one convenient landing page, which features the public’s most sought after park resources in one place including:  <br>- Parks & Trails <br>- Swimming Pools <br>- Spray Parks <br>- Sports Fields <br>- Park Rangers <br>- Shelters <br>- Recreation Centers <br>- Special Events <br>- Parks Maintenance <br>“So many City Departments work collaboratively for the good of our parks,” said Ross Chapman, Director of the Department of Parks & Recreation. “Providing quality parks and critical programming is a team effort. For the public however, it was becoming confusing to find information. Housing it all under the CitiParks banner makes the most sense.” <br>The City of Pittsburgh’s official website for its park system is available for the public, community groups, and partner organizations at citiparks.net or pittsburghpa.gov/citiparks. <br>This project would not have been possible without the work of the Departments of Innovation & Performance, Parks & Recreation, and Public Works. | 13/8/2021 11:47:51 |

Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.      <br>While many residents are continuing to work from home, the City will be continuing extra efforts to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for resurfacing will be posted weekly on [DOMI’s website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule) and will be publicized through city social media channels. | 13/8/2021 11:44:50 |
| Installation of Speed Humps on California Avenue Next Week | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 13, 2021) The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is pleased to announce the installation of traffic calming measures on California Avenue from Rankin Avenue to Bainton Street.  Data collected during the fall indicated that 94% of vehicles traveling on California Avenue exceed the posted speed limit of 25 mph, with an 85th percentile speed of 41 mph.  Coupled with a long crash history, this rate of speeding indicated a strong need for a traffic calming intervention.<br>The project will include the construction of three speed humps on California Avenue.  Permanent signage and pavement markings will be installed to alert motorists of approaching speed humps.  Speed humps are midblock traffic calming devices that raise the entire wheelbase of a vehicle to reduce its speed.<br>Work is tentatively expected to begin the week of Monday August 16 through Friday August 20, 2021, and is expected to last two days, weather permitting.  Hours of construction will be 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  One lane of traffic on California Avenue will be closed to traffic, with flaggers stationed at each intersection in order to allow for local traffic access to and from their residences.  Temporary "no parking" signage will be posted at each speed hump location.<br>If you have questions about this project or other traffic calming projects, you may contact us by email at [trafficcalming@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:trafficcalming@pittsburghpa.gov), or by calling 3-1-1 or 412-255-2621.  You can learn more about DOMI’s Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program at [www.pittsburghpa.gov/domi/traffic-calming](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/domi/traffic-calming). | 13/8/2021 13:18:23 |

| Welcoming Pittsburgh and the All for All Coalition Receive $30,000 Grant to Connect Public-Nonprofit Services for Immigrant and Refugee Communities | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 19, 2021) Mayor William Peduto announced today that the Program to Aid Citizen Enterprise (PACE) and the Bayer Center for Nonprofit Management at Robert Morris University has awarded a $30,000 grant to support the collaboration between the City’s Welcoming Pittsburgh initiative and The Global Switchboard’s All for All Coalition. <br>Building on an existing partnership in coordinating supportive and welcoming services, Welcoming Pittsburgh and the All for All Coalition are applying the funds to implement a new model designed to better understand and address immigrant and refugee communities’ needs through the collaboration and coordination of public, nonprofit and community-based resources.   <br>The model includes a series of direct discussions with immigrant and refugee individuals to better understand barriers to relationships with government and other resources, with particular emphasis on individuals who have recently arrived in Pittsburgh. Participants will be compensated through the funding and their responses will be used to determine what kinds of opportunities and services communities need.   <br>"We are excited to advance our partnership with All for All to jump-start this program,” said Feyisola Akintola, Special Initiatives Manager for the Mayor’s Office of Equity. “Welcoming Pittsburgh convenes service providers and immigrant leaders, but this pilot allows us to speak directly with more international community members and as a result, allow their input to inform the services and the ways in which we communicate our work to lead to a more accessible government." <br>Through these community conversations, the collaborative effort between Welcoming Pittsburgh and the All for All Coalition will result in improved communication pathways between government and communities with better access to resources such as homeownership support, community health and safety training and workforce development programs.   <br>Conversation responses will also be used by policymakers to gauge the effectiveness of immigrant and refugee-focused and general equity programs in the region.   <br>"The work done by the All for All Coalition members is vital to make our region more inclusive,” said Lais Alexander, All for All Coalition Manager. “Along with the Welcoming Pittsburgh support, we have been experiencing increased initiatives within our network aiming to minimize the distance between communities, organizations, and government.

| City Announces Goals on Littering and Dumping (GOLD) Plan | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 23, 2021) Mayor William Peduto joined the Department of Public Works and the Clean Pittsburgh Commission today to announce the City’s Goals on Littering and Dumping (GOLD) Plan for eradicating litter and illegal dumping citywide. The GOLD Plan is a two-pronged approach for city investments in anti-littering and dumping initiatives and opportunities for residents to help in their communities.  <br>A [recent litter cost study](https://www.keeppabeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KPB-Litter-Cost-Study-013120.pdf) indicates that in Pennsylvania, taxpayers spend almost $68 million on litter and illegal dumping mitigation. Pittsburgh has over 800 known illegal dumping sites and is making investments to strengthen enforcement efforts to catch the perpetrators of this ugly crime that is seen frequently citywide. The City and Clean Pittsburgh Commission have announced new initiatives to combat litter, including: <br>- New high resolution cameras purchased by the Clean Pittsburgh Commission to be placed at known dumping sites throughout the city to identify those illegally dumping and collect evidence. <br>- Updating City Code to more clearly define litter and illegal dumping violations and to update penalties to include community restitution. <br>- A recommendation to create positions that focus on enforcement and community outreach around illegal dumping, litter and other trash-related issues. <br>"Littering and illegal dumping is a real problem in our city and it creates blight in our neighborhoods and our hillsides, but we must all work together to combat it,” said Mayor Peduto. “I'd like to thank the Clean Pittsburgh Commission for these important recommendations so that the city can dedicate more resources to addressing littering and dumping and look forward to continuing to working with our partners and our residents towards zero litter in our beautiful city.”  <br>City officials also announced opportunities for residents and community groups to join in the campaign to end litter and dumping in the City of Pittsburgh, including: <br>- Register volunteer neighborhood clean up events on the [DPW website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/volunteer-apps/). DPW can provide gloves, bags and coordinate picking up refuse bags for your event. <br>- Download the [Litterati app](https://litterati.org/) to use during clean up events to pick up litter and data. This crowdsourced data will be the most detailed litter data ever collected in Pittsburgh, which DPW will use to develop a local litter index and inform future anti-litter initiatives.  <br>- Go for GOLD with your neighbors in the fifth annual citywide Garbage Olympics on September 18, an annual competitive litter pick up event. Learn more and register [here](https://www.pghgo.org/). <br>The GOLD Plan was developed using data and information in partnership with the Clean Pittsburgh Commission, Allegheny CleanWays, Pennsylvania Resources Council, Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy and more. A copy of the plan is available [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15402_Updated_GOLD_Plan_Report.pdf). | 23/8/2021 12:54:50 |

| Mayor Peduto Introduces First-in-the-Nation Dark Sky Lighting Legislation for Energy and Environmental Sustainability | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 24, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and the Division of Sustainability and Resilience announced a new “Dark Sky Lighting” ordinance today for all city parks, facilities and street lights. Dark Sky Lighting is the use of technology, lower color temperature and shielding to minimize the use of outdoor lighting to only that needed for comfort and safety.  <br>Dark Sky Lighting reduces unnecessary light pollution and dangerous glare that can come from lighting areas for no specific purpose, called over-lighting. Over-lighting and light pollution can negatively impact the mental and physical health of nearby neighbors, visibility for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians as well as habitats for plants, animals and birds. <br>Dark Sky Lighting supports the city’s Climate Action Plan commitment to increase energy efficiency to reduce waste and improve building operations. Under the ordinance, the City will adhere to Dark Sky principles for its newly installed or retrofitted streetlights, newly constructed and renovated park spaces and playgrounds as well as newly constructed and renovated City-owned buildings.  <br>Mayor Peduto was joined today by representatives of the National Aviary, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens and Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. All three major institutions have joined the City and pledged their commitment to Dark Sky Lighting principles in their facilities.  <br>"By introducing Dark Sky legislation, the City is further advancing its commitment to light equity, reduction of energy consumption, and elimination of waste in accordance with our Climate Action Plan goals. Our park spaces and City facilities should serve as the model for others to follow" said Mayor Peduto. "I applaud the institutions joining the City in committing to this important initiative and encourage residents and developers to join the City to adhering to Dark Sky principles."  <br>Mayor Peduto called on other institutions, companies and property owners to join in the Dark Sky Lighting principles commitment. The Office of Sustainability and Resilience will be compiling a guide for residents and businesses to scale and implement the principles on their property. <br>The City of Pittsburgh developed the ordinance with assistance and support from the International Dark-Sky International Association, Biophilic Cities Network, Carnegie Mellon University and local partners.   <br>"Pittsburgh is the first city to take a principles-based approach to legislation, clearly aligning with IDA’s values-centered approach to lighting", said Ruskin Hartley, Executive Director of the International Dark-Sky Association. "The proposed ordinance presents an opportunity to adopt policy that is easy to understand, implement, and enforce. We foresee this approach serving as a model for other municipalities looking to effectively reduce light pollution." <br>"With the newly adopted Dark Sky Lighting principles, Pittsburgh continues to shape its vision for a biophilic city that combines an emphasis on climate action with the creation of urban landscapes that invite a connection to the larger natural world," said JD Brown, Program Director, Biophilic Cities Network. "Dark Sky Lighting provides an opportunity for city residents to reconnect with the night sky while also providing critical relief for birds and other wildlife that call the city home."  <br>The Dark Sky Lighting ordinance legislation was presented to City Council today. A copy is available [here](https://pittsburgh.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5092150&GUID=D37D60F5-F174-4FC6-8744-74A0FD34CDC4&FullText=1). | 24/8/2021 12:12:07 |

| Shady Avenue Traffic Calming Speed Hump Installation | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 27, 2021) The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is pleased to announce the next phase of traffic calming measures on Shady Avenue from Pittock Street to Nicholson Street, near Taylor Allderdice High School. Data collected in 2020 indicated that 75% of vehicles traveling on Shady Avenue in this area exceed the posted speed limit of 25 mph, with an 85th percentile speed of 33 mph. The rate of speeding, especially on a school corridor where many students walk, indicated a strong need for a traffic calming intervention.<br>This portion of the project will include the construction of one speed hump on Shady Avenue. Permanent signage and pavement markings will be installed to alert motorists of approaching speed humps. Speed humps are midblock traffic calming devices that raise the entire wheelbase of a vehicle to reduce its speed.<br>Work is tentatively expected to take place on Saturday August 28, 2021, and is expected to last one day, weather permitting. Hours of construction will be 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. One lane of traffic on Shady Avenue will be closed to traffic, with flaggers stationed at each intersection in order to allow local traffic access to and from their residences. Temporary no parking signage will be posted at each speed hump location.<br>Thank you for your cooperation during this time and we hope there will be only minor inconveniences. If you have questions about this project or other traffic calming projects, you may contact us by email at trafficcalming@pittsburghpa.gov, contacting the City Response Center at 311 or 412-255-2621.

| City of Pittsburgh Prepares for Excessive Rain Today and Wednesday | PITTSBURGH, PA  (August 31, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh is preparing for storm conditions as Ida travels up into the northeast corridor. The current forecast calls for excessive rain and possible flash flooding today and Wednesday.    <br>The City is taking the following steps to prepare for the inclement weather:  <br>- The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) and Department of Public Works (DPW) are cleaning out catch basins and storm drains.    <br>- Swift Water Flood Response teams comprised of Pittsburgh Fire, EMS, and Police will be staffed from midnight tonight and begin staging in areas of the City that are most susceptible to flooding. The Zodiac-type vessels are equipped with life-saving equipment and teams of four to eight specially trained personnel.  <br>- DPW Street and Forestry crews are preparing to address downed trees and other debris that may block streets.   <br>- Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections (PLI) electrical inspectors will be on-call to address any large-scale power outages.    <br>During weather events, the City of Pittsburgh encourages everyone to exercise caution: leave your home only if needed, avoid all creeks and waterways and areas prone to flooding, do not drive through standing water, never drive around flood barriers or posted closures and abide by all detours.   <br>“According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), in our region, 2.56 inches of rain needs to fall in one hour or 4.89 inches in a 24-hour period to be a 100-year storm,” said Mayor William Peduto. “For a 50-year storm, 2.3 inches must accumulate in one hour or 4.38 inches over 24 hours. We are preparing the City resources to address what comes our way and encourage our residents to use caution and take appropriate steps to stay safe.” | 31/8/2021 13:18:40 |
| Mayor Peduto Signs Executive Order Related to Fentanyl Test Strips for Overdose Prevention on Overdose Awareness Day | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 31, 2021) Mayor William Peduto issued an Executive Order today calling to allow the possession and use of fentanyl test strips, a key opioid overdose prevention tool, in the City of Pittsburgh. The Order also directs the City of Pittsburgh Office of Community Health and Safety (OCH&S) to work with city employees and the public to educate them on the benefits of these lifesaving tools and to reduce the stigma associated with possessing them.  <br>Fentanyl test strips have been proven to prevent opioid overdoses and save lives as they allow users to identify the presence of fentanyl in unregulated drugs including injectable drugs, powders and pills. Awareness of fentanyl allows individuals to use appropriate harm reduction strategies to reduce the risk of an overdose.  <br>Fentanyl is an extremely potent opioid that can quickly stop breathing and cause an opioid overdose, which can lead to death. Opioid use disorder is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States and the regional rate of overdose deaths has accelerated faster than national averages, with countywide overdose deaths increasing 22% from 2019 to 2020, with fentanyl present in 77% of those deaths.  <br>According to a recent [public service announcement](https://pittsburghpa.gov/ochs/announcements-press-releases) from OCH&S, there have been reports of increased presence of fentanyl in “heroin, cocaine, crack, methamphetamine, benzodiazepines, ecstasy and counterfeit pills such as Percocet and Xanax \[in the Greater Pittsburgh area\]. While fentanyl has been present in the heroin supply for several years in this region, there are increasing reports of other, non-opioid drugs that have been cut with or contaminated by fentanyl.”  <br>With this executive order, the City of Pittsburgh joins the Pennsylvania Attorney General and Allegheny County District Attorney in adopting a policy to not arrest individuals who possess or distribute fentanyl test strips for harm reduction purposes.  <br>The pandemic has exacerbated mental health conditions, economic stressors and caused individuals to use drugs alone in larger amounts with increased frequency, which are common risk factors for unsafe opioid use. The presence of fentanyl also contributes to deepening racial inequity, with Black men experiencing a 200% increase in overdose deaths from 2019-2020 over the same time period in 2018-2019. <br>“Fentanyl test strips have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control and other expert organizations as a critical tool in preventing opioid-related overdoses and deaths,” said Mayor Peduto. “Other policies have stigmatized drug use, but yet we are still seeing the number of opioid overdoses climbing. I have signed this executive order on International Overdose Awareness Day because if we have the tools to help prevent overdose deaths, it is our responsibility to help healthcare providers, outreach organizations and municipal government get them to our communities.”  <br>A full copy of the executive order is available [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15559_EO_Final_Fentanyl.pdf). | 31/8/2021 11:41:20 |

| Carnegie Mellon University Partners with City to Fund Four Mile Run Playground and Lewis Playground Improvements | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 3, 2021) – Carnegie Mellon University and the City of Pittsburgh have partnered to provide support for the rehabilitation of Four Mile Run playground in Greenfield and improvements at Lewis playground in Hazelwood, as part of the OnePGH community investment plan [announced earlier this year](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4906) by Mayor William Peduto. <br>Both playgrounds are located in highly-used areas near the Carnegie Mellon University campus and in need of improvements. CMU has stepped up to provide the funds to build a brand-new recreation area and enhance an existing playground for these two communities. <br>“Carnegie Mellon University is committed to enhancing quality of life for our community members and neighbors in Pittsburgh and Southwestern Pennsylvania,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian. “This partnership to improve two beloved playgrounds close to our campus is both an expression of this university-wide commitment and an investment in Pittsburgh as a vibrant and family-friendly region. I look forward to seeing Four Mile Run Playground and Lewis Playground bring joy to children and families in Greenfield and Hazelwood for years to come.” <br>“I want to thank Carnegie Mellon for this investment, which is precisely the kind of partnership we envisioned with OnePGH — something that will benefit the city, the university and the community at large,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>While the new Four Mile Run playground is planned and fabricated, the Department of Public Works (DPW) will make short-term repairs to keep it safe and usable for children. DPW will then lead a community engagement process on the new design of the playground, including on the EngagePGH website. <br>"I want to thank Carnegie Mellon for stepping up to invest in the Greenfield and Hazelwood communities, and especially, the children of the neighborhoods. I also want to thank the Mayor's Office for developing partnerships such as these to create resources,” said City Councilman Corey O’Connor. "These will be safe spaces for families and young people to have fun, learn, and build community for years to come." <br>In late April Mayor Peduto released the OnePGH [prospectus](http://onepgh.org/documents/ONEPGH-Investment-Prospectus-2021.pdf) and [website](http://onepgh.org/), which identifies areas of focus for participating institutions, including affordable housing, the Office of Community Health and Safety, community engagement centers, workforce development, Rec2Tech, green infrastructure and parks. After the playground rehabilitations and improvements have been designed with DPW and the community, Carnegie Mellon will provide funding to the City, as approved by City Council to fund these playground enhancements. | 3/9/2021 11:57:23 |

| City Council to Consider Mayor Peduto's Groundbreaking Assured Cash Experiment (Ace) PGH Initiative to Address Poverty and Inequity | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 8, 2021) City Council will consider Mayor William Peduto's plans for the Assured Cash Experiment PGH (AcePGH), a guaranteed basic income pilot to combat poverty and inequity that will provide an unrestricted $500 monthly cash transfer to 200 people in the City of Pittsburgh. One hundred of the participants will be Black women in response to inequities that Black women face in Pittsburgh, as clearly defined in the 2019 Gender Equity Commission report [Pittsburgh’s Inequality Across Gender and Race.](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10645__Pittsburgh's_Inequality_Across_Gender_and_Race_JULY_2020.pdf)

According to the report, Black women and children are more likely to live in poverty in Pittsburgh than comparable cities. Pittsburgh’s Black women are five times as likely as white men to live in poverty and twice as likely than white women. In response to this, the Office of Mayor Peduto has designed a guaranteed basic income policy to address the poverty inequitably faced by Black women in our communities at the recommendation of the Gender Equity Commission report.

Guaranteed basic income was championed by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King who said that poverty could be eradicated by providing every American a direct, guaranteed middle-class income. He argued that that other programs to address poverty were less effective in that they seek to address one root cause at a time, writing “the programs of the past all have another common failing – they are indirect. Each seeks to solve poverty by first solving something else.”

Last summer, Mayor Peduto joined [Mayors for a Guaranteed Income (MGI)](https://www.mayorsforagi.org/), a forward-thinking network of mayors from around the country started by Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, California. Following Dr. King’s philosophy, they advocate providing direct, unrestricted recurring cash payments to residents to give them a boost and an income floor that lifts up families who have been struggling long before the pandemic.

The City of Pittsburgh will join cities nationwide in utilizing relief funds from the American Rescue Plan to fund part of the program through [OnePGH](http://onepgh.org/about.html), a nonprofit organization that is supported by public and private investment to allow for the collaboration of local government, business, philanthropy and nonprofits to improve the lives of all Pittsburghers. The program will also be funded through grants from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and MGI.

| City Launches OneTaxPGH Online Tax Management Platform | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 9, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Finance has announced OneTaxPGH, a new online business and real estate tax management system that will improve convenience and efficiency for both taxpayers and city staff.   <br>The secure digital platform will replace the current antiquated internal and external real estate billing and business tax collection systems. It will provide an online portal where taxpayers can register a new business, view and pay taxes and submit forms online.  <br>City taxpayers will be able to:  <br>- Create an account to see bills, statements and history.  <br>- Pay taxes online, including with e-check that will automatically post to their account within 24 hours.  <br>- Track the status of their payments and payment history.  <br>- Opt-in for e-delivery and email notifications to minimize the need for paper forms.  <br>- Submit forms and information.   <br>“Throughout my time as mayor, my administration has been committed to modernizing city services to improve ease, transparency and efficiency,” said Mayor William Peduto. “We all hold the world in the palm of our hands – on our phones – and access to paying your taxes should be no different. The people of Pittsburgh deserve OneTaxPGH and I applaud the Finance Department for their hard work in integrating antiquated systems into one centralized online service.”   <br>Each year, the Finance Department staff is responsible for the collection of over $500 million in taxes and processing over 700,000 forms within multiple software systems. Centralizing and digitizing tax submissions into one software system will streamline tax submissions, improve staff’s ability to manage them and allow staff to more easily identify those who have not yet paid taxes in order to collect revenue for critical city investments like playgrounds and street paving.   <br>“OneTaxPGH will allow Pittsburgh taxpayers to interact with the Department of Finance in a more efficient manner, and will streamline the daily work of department staff allowing us to better serve taxpayers,” said Finance Director Doug Anderson. “I’d like to thank and commend the employees of the Department of Finance for their hard work on implementing this new system. A project implementation of this magnitude is not easy, especially under the conditions in which our world has been operating for over a year.”   <br>The new system will be introduced in phases, with the Finance Department staff-only portal having launched September 1. The public online portal for business taxes will launch in October and public online portal for real estate taxes will launch this winter. Taxpayers will be notified how to access the online portal by mail. <br>Taxpayers can take a survey about their payment preferences on the [OneTaxPGH public engagement site](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/onetaxpgh), where additional information will be available in the coming weeks. | 9/9/2021 09:30:02 |

Welcoming Pittsburgh uses the Roadmap to guide their work that extends throughout the year.  <br>This year, Welcoming Pittsburgh coordinated several community partners into a workforce subcommittee to develop a series of resources for employers and immigrant, refugee and New American workers. The subcommittee produced three documents that include a resource for complex immigration statuses and the US immigration system, a directory of workforce development resources to support career-seekers from the immigrant and international communities and a list of employers that meet criteria to create a welcoming environment for immigrant and international workers. The resources are available [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/wp/workforce).  <br>Additional initiatives of Welcoming Pittsburgh include developing a language access plan for city departments, a cultural competency training for public safety officials and other work outlined in their [2020 annual report](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13292_2020_Annual_Report.pdf).  <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15677_Welcoming_Week_2021.jpg) | 9/9/2021 15:19:42 |

| Peduto Administration Proposes Multimodal-Focused Changes for Restaurants and Drive-Through Uses | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 13, 2021) Mayor William Peduto’s administration is forwarding legislation to the Planning Commission to promote walkable and safe neighborhoods for all by reducing the impact of vehicle-oriented uses for restaurants, with new standards for drive-throughs and updated parking requirements.   <br>The [proposed ordinance](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15601_Restaurant_and_Drive_Through_Legislation.pdf) amends the Zoning Code to create standards that allow the City to assess and reduce negative impacts of drive-through uses in certain zoning districts, including neighborhood business districts and others. New drive-through businesses proposed in the areas identified in the ordinance will require approval from the Zoning Board of Adjustment.  <br>In addition to ZBA approval, the legislation would also require any individual or company proposing a drive-through business to submit a Transportation Impact Study to the City’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI). In an effort to improve safety for pedestrians, cyclists, individuals using wheelchairs, and motorists, DOMI staff will review each study and require the applicant to make necessary changes to mitigate any detrimental impacts of vehicle-oriented businesses on the surrounding community.   <br>The legislation also reduces minimum parking requirements and implements maximum parking requirements for restaurants and fast food restaurants as follows: <br>- For fast food restaurants, the legislation would require 1 off-street parking space for every 500 square feet of space. Currently, the Zoning Code requires 1 off-street parking space for every 75 square feet of space. The proposed bill would implement a maximum parking requirement of 1 off-street space for every 175 square feet of space. There is currently no maximum parking requirement for this use.   <br>- For all other restaurants, the legislation would require 1 off-street parking space for every 500 square feet. Currently, the Zoning Code requires 1 off-street parking space for every 125 square feet of space. The proposed bill would increase the maximum parking requirement from 1 off-street parking space for every 75 square feet to 1 off-street parking space for every 175 square feet of space.   <br>In addition to improving safety for users of surrounding streets, reducing minimum parking requirements and implementing maximum parking requirements simplifies the zoning process for restaurant owners and decreases costs associated with opening a business.   <br>“In Pittsburgh, over 20% of our residents do not own a vehicle, and a growing number of our neighbors choose to commute via a method other than driving alone,” said Mayor Peduto. “This commonsense and much-needed legislation modernizes our Zoning Code, updates antiquated parking requirements, and advances my administration’s efforts to build safer streets for all users. I applaud the Department of City Planning for their work on this bill.”  <br>The legislation will be presented to the City Planning Commission on Tuesday, September 14. The Commission will then take action on the proposal during their meeting on Tuesday, September 28 before forwarding their recommendation for consideration by City Council. | 13/9/2021 15:27:07 |
| City's Fifth Annual Garbage Olympics Recruiting Volunteers from Over Half of Pittsburgh's Neighborhoods | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 13, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works (DPW) is inviting Pittsburghers to go for GOLD with neighbors in the fifth annual citywide Garbage Olympics on September 18. The annual competitive litter pick up event has attracted more than 40 Pittsburgh neighborhood teams, as well as teams from two neighboring municipalities, to compete in picking up garbage and litter from city streets.  <br>The event goes from 9-11 a.m. and DPW and Mayor Peduto’s [Clean Pittsburgh Commission](https://pittsburghpa.gov/clean-pgh/cpc) will provide bags, gloves, safety vests, and "nifty nabber" litter grabbers. DPW will again collect the trash from designated locations in each neighborhood, and the City’s hard-to-recycle vendor, [ECS&R](https://ecsr.net/pittsburgh-recycling/), will drive around to pick up and recycle the televisions found during clean-ups. <br>Interested residents can find registered neighborhood teams, captain contact information and meeting spots on [PGHGO.org.](https://www.pghgo.org/) Interested participants can also email [garbageolympicspgh@gmail.com](mailto:garbageolympicspgh@gmail.com) or text or call 412-709-5155 to join a team.  <br>“Each act of cleaning up litter isn't just one action. It accomplished dozens of things, every single time,” said the city’s Anti-Litter Specialist Chris Mitchell. “It raises pride in your community. It makes your community safer. It makes your community stronger. It makes the land and water around you less poisonous. It discourages further littering by keeping it clean in the first place.” <br>The Garbage Olympics began in 2017 with five teams competing for an Oscar award for the most trash collected. The event has grown exponentially since starting, with 38 of Pittsburgh’s 90 neighborhoods participating in 2020. <br>“The Garbage Olympics allows anyone to make an impact in their neighborhood. You can have a team of two or 50… you know that you’re a part of a bigger goal with all Pittsburgh neighborhoods doing a trash collection together," Renee Robinson Garbage Olympics co-founder and organizer.  <br>Winners will be announced at a closing ceremony at Threadbare Cider House in Spring Garden beginning at 12pm. <br>Garbage Olympics Contacts:  <br>Chris Mitchell, Anti Litter Specialist for the City of Pittsburgh - (412) 302-3460 <br>Lena Andrews, event organizer - (412) 607-1957 <br>Renee Robinson, event organizer - (412) 999-8928 | 13/9/2021 10:12:24 |
| DOMI to Host Public Meeting on Strip District Liberty Avenue Safety Improvement Project Next Week | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 14, 2021) The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) will be hosting a virtual public meeting next Tuesday, September 21 at 6:00 p.m. to collect feedback on the proposed changes to travel lanes, intersections, traffic operations and transit stops as part of the Liberty Avenue Safety Improvement Project in the Strip District.  <br>The purpose of the Liberty Avenue Safety Improvement Project is to improve safety for people walking, biking, driving and taking public transit along Liberty Avenue in the Strip District between 11th Street and Herron Avenue. The project is still in the beginning stages of design, so DOMI will present the proposed design, which incorporates priorities identified in the community-led Strip District Plan as well as the City’s [Pedestrian Safety Action Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/psap-events) and [Bike(+) Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan), at next week’s meeting.   <br>Meeting attendees will have the opportunity to provide feedback on the preliminary design, which includes:  <br>- A vehicle travel lane reduction to improve motorist safety along the corridor.  <br>- Traffic signal upgrade such as upgraded controllers, potential new signals, new pedestrian pushbuttons, upgraded ADA accommodations, upgraded crosswalks and count-down pedestrian signals.  <br>- Priority transit stops will be upgraded to provide more waiting room for transit riders and improved pedestrian access to transit stops along Liberty Avenue, in coordination with the Port Authority of Allegheny County. <br>- Bicycle travel lanes on Liberty Avenue between 32nd Street to Herron Avenue connecting the Liberty Avenue bike lanes leading to Bloomfield with bike facilities planned in the Strip District. <br>Feedback will be incorporated into future designs. Construction is planned for Summer 2023. Registration is required and information for the virtual meeting can be found [here](https://tooledesign.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZElfu6vqj4oEtBs3WOf7JgOpwXJQKCnZNLM%C2%A0).  <br>The Liberty Avenue Safety Improvement Project is anticipated to invest $6.2 million and is funded through a  Highway Safety Improvement Program by the federal and state governments.  <br>Additional information about the [Liberty Avenue Safety Improvement Project](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12825_Project_Fact_Sheet.pdf) can be found on [DOMI’s projects website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/current-projects).  <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15704_Liberty_SIP_Opt.jpg)<br>_Rendering of a potential design that will be presented at the [public meeting](http://tooledesign.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZElfu6vqj4oEtBs3WOf7JgOpwXJQKCnZNLM%C2%A0) for community feedback._ | 14/9/2021 14:48:10 |

| Pittsburgh Receives $433,000 National Grant for Community-Led Greenway Improvement | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 14, 2021) Mayor William Peduto announced today a $433,000, two-and-a-half year grant from the National Recreation and Parks Association for the Greenways Partnership Program. This grant was received and will be administered by the OnePGH Fund in close partnership with the City of Pittsburgh to enhance the city’s 1,200-acre network of greenways. <br>The City will be using the funding to develop a model for public-nonprofit-community partnerships to maintain and improve greenways for residents and visitors through the [Greenways for Pittsburgh](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/greenways) program. Pittsburgh will receive ongoing technical assistance, professional development and access to networks of like-minded park and recreation professionals throughout the country.  <br>“Greenways provide essential green space to help build strong, healthy and resilient communities,” said Mayor Peduto. “This grant provides the City the opportunity continue to build on over 30 years of community-led stewardship to ensure that our stewards have the resources to improve greenways, our greenways continue to get the attention they deserve and our communities have access to enjoy them.”  <br>The grant funding will be administered to the OnePGH Fund to work towards goals outlined in Greenways for Pittsburgh, managed by the Department of City Planning. The City has long relied on unfunded volunteer stewardship groups to assist in the maintenance of the greenways, so the model will include expanding and empowering a network of community stewardship groups to work with the City to identify areas of need and improvement in greenways and creating a menu of partner organizations and contractors to conduct restoration and access work. Additionally, the OnePGH fund will hire a greenway contractor to make the program financially and ecologically sustainable through preservation and restoration carbon credits.  <br>The program will expand on the work started by an ongoing [pilot program for the Hazelwood Greenway](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4719), funded by the Trust for Public Land. The City is working with community partners to identify projects and priorities for restoring the greenway to a safe, high-quality and ecologically healthy green space.

| City of Pittsburgh Announces Environmental Insights Explorer Partnership with Google for Climate Change Mitigation Data | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 15, 2021) The Department of City Planning’s Sustainability and Resilience Division has unveiled their online public [Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE)](https://insights.sustainability.google/places/ChIJA4UGSG_xNIgRNBuiWqEV-Y0). Developed by Google, EIE provides climate action data visualized on interactive maps to see building carbon emissions, transportation emissions, rooftops that could successfully host solar panels, and tree canopy coverage citywide.  <br>EIE will provide baseline knowledge to better understand and help prioritize city climate change mitigation initiatives as part of Mayor William Peduto’s [Climate Action Plan 3.0](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/climate-action-plan). The tool can be used to look at big picture citywide emissions trends and zoom in on specific buildings or areas to see more acute climate data. <br>The City of Pittsburgh is working with Google to use their advanced EIE algorithm to annually produce emissions inventory data. The Sustainability and Resilience Division, in collaboration with ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, currently collects and analyzes emissions data every five years to create a greenhouse gas inventory to develop a climate action plan. Compiling the data takes city staff, agencies and other partners over a year to complete because data sets are not centralized. This tool will be updated annually and allow the City to track climate progress at more frequent intervals.  <br>“This is a critical tool in helping us to understand climate change and how it affects our city,” said Mayor Peduto. “These maps make it easy for the City and our citizens to pinpoint areas of concern, which make it easier to develop creative and effective solutions. Everyone has a role to play in climate change and I encourage our businesses and residents to have a look at how emissions affect your community.” <br>The tool allows Pittsburghers to visually understand environmental impacts and the ability to decrease emissions by creating efficiencies in the transportation, building and energy sectors and increasing tree canopy. The tool also allows Pittsburghers to assess solar potential for their own buildings as well as how and where planting trees can contribute to cooling our city. Examples of ways to use EIE to mitigate climate change include:  <br>- EIE shows that citywide transportation emissions have decreased by over 20% since the beginning of the pandemic, suggesting that 1/5 of transportation emissions come from commuting. This could indicate that using shared, public or alternative transportation options to get to work or school could reduce emissions.  <br>- Companies and private building owners can use the map to understand their carbon footprint and see if their rooftop is a good candidate to install solar as an alternative energy source.  <br>- Residents could use the map to see how their home, school or office building is contributing to carbon emissions and how that can change over time by taking steps towards efficiency. <br>- EIE maps trees, surface temperatures and population density to see how trees are helping to mitigate the affects of climate change and inform what areas need additional trees, which can support the Shade Tree Commission’s new [Equitable Street Tree Investment Strategy.](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4734)<br>“Pittsburgh was one of the first cities to pilot EIE in 2018, before it expanded to more than 10,000 cities worldwide, and is one of only 15 cities with an EIE map of the city’s tree canopy,” said Chief Resilience Officer Grant Ervin. “The collaboration with Google gives us a critical tool to identify opportunity areas for carbon emissions reduction and how we can help residents build resilience and adapt to our changing climate.  We are excited to be at the forefront of cities advancing technologies to address the climate crisis.”  <br>The EIE is available [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/environmental-insights-explorer) on the City’s website and additional information about Google’s EIE is available [here](https://insights.sustainability.google/). | 15/9/2021 10:10:45 |

| Beechwood Boulevard Traffic Calming Project to Start Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 16, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is pleased to announce traffic calming measures on Beechwood Boulevard from Rosemont Lane to Luster Street. Data collected in 2020 indicated that 97% of vehicles traveling on Beechwood Boulevard in this area exceed the posted speed limit of 25 mph, with an 85th percentile speed of 38 mph. The rate of speeding along with crash history in this area indicated a strong need for a traffic calming intervention.<br>This portion of the project will include the construction of four (4) speed humps on Beechwood Boulevard. Permanent signage and pavement markings will be installed to alert motorists of approaching speed humps. Speed humps are midblock traffic calming devices that raise the entire wheelbase of a vehicle to reduce its speed. In conjunction with speed humps, a pedestrian refuge island at the crosswalk near Guy Street and a painted median around the curve near Rosemount Lane will be installed.<br>Work is tentatively expected to begin on Monday September 20, 2021, and is expected to last one week, weather permitting. Hours of construction will be 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. One lane of traffic on Beechwood Boulevard will be closed to traffic, with flaggers stationed at each intersection in order to allow local traffic access to and from their residences. Temporary no parking signage will be posted throughout the corridor where work is taking place.<br>Thank you for your cooperation during this time and we hope there will be only minor inconveniences. If you have any questions or require further information regarding this closure you may contact the City’s Response Center by calling 311 or 412-255-2621.<br>If you have questions about this project or other traffic calming projects, you may contact us by email at trafficcalming@pittsburghpa.gov, or by calling 3-1-1.

| Director of Mobility and Infrastructure to Leave to Join Federal Transit Administration | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 17, 2021) Mayor William Peduto announced today that Karina Ricks, the Director of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), will be leaving her role with the City of Pittsburgh.   <br>“As the very first Director of DOMI, Karina has established a structure in DOMI that brings vision and energy so that our infrastructure not only meets the demands of today, but is designed thoughtfully, inclusively, equitably and sustainably so that we are prepared for the next generations of mobility. Under her leadership, the City has built bridges, paved record miles of roads, introduced autonomous vehicles and rideshares and found creative and effective solutions so that our roads are safe and our public infrastructure is for all.”   <br>Director Ricks joined the Peduto administration in February 2017 as the inaugural director of the brand new DOMI. Intended to lead efforts to provide residents with safe, accessible, sustainable and efficient transportation options through working with multiple agencies, integrating technology and bringing equitable shared mobility to the city, Director Ricks also crafted DOMI’s principles:   <br>- No one dies or is seriously injured traveling on city streets.  <br>- Every household in Pittsburgh can access fresh fruits and vegetables within 20 minutes travel of home, without the requirement of a private vehicle.  <br>- All trips less than 1 mile are easy and enjoyable to walk, roll or bike.  <br>- No household must spend more than 45% of household income to satisfy basic housing, transportation and energy needs.  <br>- The design, maintenance and operation of city streets reflects the values of our community.  <br>Under her leadership, DOMI has built a talented and committed team that has delivered multiple projects and programs that fulfill these principles and meet the needs of the Pittsburgh community. Among them:  <br>- Delivering the investment of nearly a quarter of a billion dollars ($237,000,000) in capital infrastructure projects to dramatically expand improvement and restoration of roads, bridges, public steps and more. This includes $67 million for street resurfacing, $28 million in bridge projects and repairs and a 50% increase in on-street bike(+) facilities.  <br>- Delivering community-driven and publicly transparent projects, programs and action plans, including the City Steps Plan, Bike(+) Plan and Pedestrian Safety Action Plan as well as neighborhood-based plans and initiatives to deliver high service and prioritize safety.  <br>- Establishing new policies and management structures for emerging mobility including autonomous vehicles, micromobility and curbside management.   <br>- Introducing new programs to improve safety and quality of life in the city including pedestrian crossings and sidewalk improvements, traffic calming, bike(+) infrastructure and expanded trails.  <br>- Laying the groundwork to deliver on smart city infrastructure including modernized traffic signals and energy efficient street lighting.  <br>- Working with partners across the city and region to support improvements in public transit, equitable mobility, parking management, land development projects and utility upgrades.   <br>- Responding to over 25 landslides and massively scaling up slope movement as well as flood and stormwater mitigation in response to the increasing impacts of climate change, investing nearly $30 million.  <br>- Quickly adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic to activate public rights of way for streeteries to facilitate new business operations and slow streets to promote safety in neighborhoods.   <br>“It has been a great honor to serve the people of Pittsburgh,” she said, “I am proud of the strong and capable organization we have built and the deep bench of leadership and skill within it. I know DOMI will continue to deliver world-class projects in the months and years to come.”   <br>Director Ricks will be moving on to serve as the Associate Administrator for Research, Innovation and Demonstration with the Federal Transit Administration in Washington, D.C. In this role, she will work to advance key initiatives around transit safety, electrification, mobility on demand and transit of the future to serve the mission of equitable, efficient and sustainable mobility for both urban and rural America. <br>Director Ricks’ resignation is effective Friday, September 24. | 16/9/2021 23:13:37 |
| Pittsburgh Becomes 12th Certified Welcoming Place for Immigrant, Refugee and New Americans in the United States | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 17, 2021) As part of the City of Pittsburgh’s [Welcoming Week 2021](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/5257), the Office of Mayor William Peduto and Office of Equity’s Welcoming Pittsburgh are pleased to announce that Pittsburgh has been named a Certified Welcoming place, becoming the 12th in the United States to achieve this designation.   <br>To become Certified Welcoming, the City of Pittsburgh completed an intensive evaluation. Local policies and programs for immigrant, refugee and New American inclusion, led by Welcoming Pittsburgh, were compared to the comprehensive [Welcoming Standard](https://www.welcomingamerica.org/welcoming-standard) that covers community investments from education to economic development to policing. <br>As of 2019, immigrant residents in Pittsburgh make up nearly 4% of the population, with 76% being of prime working age (16-64). Additionally, immigrant residents are 27% more likely to be entrepreneurs and more likely to hold graduate degrees. [According to New American Economy](https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/pittsburgh/), immigrants in Pittsburgh pay $1.2 billion in taxes and hold $2.7 billion in spending power, demonstrating their sizable impact on the economy locally and beyond.  <br>"Pittsburgh has a tradition of welcoming immigrants from all around the world to contribute to the rich cultural fabric of our city,” said Mayor Peduto. “We know that today, just as it has been historically, immigrants make our city stronger because when our neighbors have equitable access to opportunities and succeed, Pittsburgh succeeds. That’s why we have strived to be a welcoming city and are grateful to be a Certified Welcoming city. I’d like to thank Welcoming America for recognizing the work of Welcoming Pittsburgh, our community partners and our residents in creating a community where our policies and programs promote action for immigrant inclusion, especially in a time where our immigrant neighbors need us the most.” <br>Welcoming Pittsburgh works with several partners to implement policies, programs and initiatives guided by the [Welcoming Pittsburgh Roadmap](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/mayorpeduto/WelcomingPittsburgh_RoadMap_FullReport_FINAL2.pdf), a comprehensive citywide plan compiled by 40 local leaders from diverse sectors and over 3,000 community members. Partners include the Welcoming Pittsburgh steering committee, All for All Coalition, Allegheny County Department of Human Services, Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh and more.  <br>Policies and initiatives enacted as a result of the roadmap are available [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/wp/roadmap-report).  <br>The [Certified Welcoming program](http://certifiedwelcoming.org/) is run and administered by [Welcoming America](http://welcomingamerica.org/), a national nonprofit organization that aims to build a nation of neighbors by fostering welcoming communities. <br>"It’s my great pleasure to congratulate the City of Pittsburgh on achieving the status of Certified Welcoming. As Pittsburgh becomes a more diverse city, and prepares to welcome new families from Afghanistan, this public-private partnership reflects the phenomenal work of community based organizations with the public sector to reduce the barriers residents might face to full participation - civically, socially, and economically," said Rachel Perić, executive director of Welcoming America. “A big thanks to Mayor Peduto for his leadership and legacy; Feyisola Alabi of Welcoming Pittsburgh; and the Welcoming Pittsburgh Steering Committee for their work and belief in welcoming values as a benefit for all Pittsburghers."  <br>Pittsburgh landlords who are interested in working with the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development to provide housing for refugees can find out more information here, fill out [this poll](https://forms.gle/ieGntA7bwK84YzFSA) or contact [refugeehousing@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:refugeehousing@pittsburghpa.gov). <br>**About Welcoming Pittsburgh**<br>Welcoming Pittsburgh is an immigrant, refugee and asylee integration strategy launched by Mayor William Peduto in 2014. The Mayor’s Office is leading implementation of the plan through cross-sectoral partnerships. Welcoming Pittsburgh is rooted in a commitment to ensure a more livable city for all residents. <br>**About Certified Welcoming**<br>The [Certified Welcoming program](http://certifiedwelcoming.org/) launched in 2017 by Welcoming America to establish a formal designation for cities and counties that have taken action on their commitment to welcoming and met the high bar set by the [Welcoming Standard.](https://www.welcomingamerica.org/sites/default/files/Welcoming%20Standard%20%2B%20Certified%20Welcoming.pdf) Certified Welcoming communities gain a competitive advantage by using their designation for attracting and retaining a global workforce and businesses whose values align with welcoming and inclusion. Participants complete a rigorous independent audit to evaluate their compliance with the Standard. Both Certified Welcoming and the Welcoming Standard were designed following standards [set by ISEAL](https://www.isealalliance.org/).  <br>**About Welcoming America**<br>Welcoming America is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that leads a movement of inclusive communities becoming more prosperous by ensuring everyone belongs. We believe that all people, including immigrants, are valued contributors and vital to the success of our communities and shared future.

| Over $7.1 Million Added to the Greater Hill District Neighborhood Reinvestment Fund for Community Investments in the Middle and Upper Hill District | PITTSBURGH, PA (September  20, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh, City Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle, Pittsburgh Penguins, Buccini/Pollin Group, Inc. and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA), announced today that the Greater Hill District Neighborhood Reinvestment Fund has received an initial capitalized payment of $7,187,045 from the development partners on the Lower Hill development site. This funding will be used to invest in development projects and other community needs in the Greater Hill District as outlined in the “Community Collaboration and Implementation Plan” between the neighborhood and the developers.  <br>“I am grateful that we are not only seeing the development in the Lower Hill move forward to right the wrongs of the past and create opportunities in the historic Hill District, but that our development partners are demonstrating their commitment to the Hill community by providing community investment funding up front,” said Mayor William Peduto. “I’d like to thank all of the partners in this development and the Hill District community for creating a model where communities and developers can work together to help ensure the community benefits and drives investment in their neighborhood from these developments.” <br>The guidelines for the Greater Hill District Neighborhood Reinvestment Fund were approved by the URA board in June. As a condition of the approval process, the developers, a joint venture comprised of the Buccini/Pollin Group, Inc (BPG), Pittsburgh Arena Real Estate Redevelopment, LP (PAR), Clay Cove Capital, LLC, and First National Bank (FNB), committed to funding their 10-years' worth of payments all up front, so that the community could receive funding immediately rather than after construction is completed.  <br>Bomani M. Howze, Vice President of Development for the Buccini/Pollin Group, said, “We are excited to have delivered on our promise of the first installment of $7.2 Million toward the Greater Hill District Neighborhood Reinvestment Fund. The monetization of LERTA monies from the FNB Financial Center symbolizes our commitment to ensure that catalytic, Lower Hill projects are delivered with intent of having lasting impact in the Middle and Upper Hill District.” <br>The more than $7 million is generated by the Lower Hill Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance (LERTA) district, which was driven by Councilman Lavelle and the Hill Community Development Corporation in 2015. The LERTA allows property owners on the Lower Hill development site to receive real estate tax abatements from the three taxing bodies (Pittsburgh Public School District, City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County) on each parcel for 10 years, with half of that funding going into the Greater Hill District Neighborhood Reinvestment Fund.  <br>"The advancement of the LERTA dollars is in keeping with the commitment that I made to the Hill District Community: that the development of the Lower Hill would be for the explicit benefit of residents of the Middle and Upper Hill District,” said Councilman Lavelle.  <br>Some of the potential uses for the funding could include project development initiatives and counseling programs, children and youth education initiatives, rent and mortgage assistance subsidies, other wealth-building initiatives, preservation of Hill District institutions and investments that generate recurring or matching revenue for the fund.  <br>"I am thankful and encouraged by the development team’s investment up front to the community,” said URA Deputy Executive Director Dr. Diamonte Walker. “The URA is committed to working with our partners to ensure that the Lower Hill redevelopment reflects the wants and needs of the community and benefits all the residents of the Hill District." <br>Applications for funding will be received and reviewed by a community advisory board, who will issue recommendations to the URA Board of Directors who govern the fund. Current guidelines designate representatives from City Council District 6 and the Hill Community Development Corporation as co-chairs of the advisory board. | 20/9/2021 11:04:54 |

We thank the URA and Mayor’s Office and look forward to continuing this community conversation.” <br>The community meeting will be held virtually on Zoom or Facebook Live on Tuesday, September 28 at 7:00 p.m. Additional information and a registration link can be found [here on the URA’s website](https://www.ura.org/events/community-meeting-swisshelm-park-solar-development?day=09-28-2021). | 21/9/2021 11:55:18 |
| City Partners with Kiwibot to Pilot Free Delivery of Food, Medicine and Books by Delivery Robot | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 21, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) has announced a pilot program with Kiwibot to work with local businesses like Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Wilson’s Pharmacy and Taquitos to provide free, equitable delivery of books, medicine and food to residents through personal delivery devices, commonly known as delivery robots. The pilot is funded by the Knight Foundation and will focus on bringing residents to the center of the conversation around this emerging technology.  <br>During the pilot, the City will explore how to increase affordable delivery options for local businesses, pharmacies and libraries for “last mile” deliveries, focusing the pilot in portions of the Bloomfield, Garfield and Lawrenceville neighborhoods. The City and local partners will focus on exploring opportunities to provide equitable access to food, education and medication while minimizing delivery cost for locally-owned businesses.<br>The pilot will also provide an opportunity for city officials to ensure that delivery robots, which were recently legalized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, are deployed only in areas where they can operate safely among pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles.  <br>Preparations, planning and mapping for the pilot between DOMI and Kiwibot started in July and delivery robots are expected to be deployed later this week. Up to 10 delivery robots will be deployed, each remotely controlled by a human supervisor.  <br>The City will also be working with [Assemble](https://assemblepgh.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjws4aKBhDPARIsAIWH0JUhYOzoZ3Ib7cfvLDoZPlNmADIIA14TDoSHw_ojv1AYAR16aWoBYRYaAo69EALw_wcB), a community space for arts and technology, to expand awareness about the personal delivery device technology and technology careers with local youth.  <br>Additional information can be found on the pilot’s [EngagePGH website](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/pdd-pilot). | 21/9/2021 11:01:19 |
| Child Care Quality Fund Grants Over $387,250 for Improvements to Local Child Care Facilities | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 21, 2021) Mayor William Peduto’s Office of Equity has announced that the Child Care Quality Fund (CCFQ) has awarded $387,250 in grants to eleven local licensed child care facilities to implement strategic investments to ensure that young children have access to safe and high quality early learning and care, as well as to help improve their state Keystone STARS quality rating.  <br>This is the first round of grant awards under the program chosen by the CCQF selection committee, who will review applications and disburse grants from the $2 million fund each quarter.

| Citiparks Distributes 1 Million Free Meals to Eligible Children and Seniors Since Start of Pandemic | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 22, 2021) Eighteen months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Parks & Recreation (Citiparks) has reached an incredible milestone, having distributed one million free meals to eligible children and seniors.  <br>After all community recreation and senior centers closed in March 2020, Citiparks created a new system of Grab n Go food distributions at those locations to ensure that youth and seniors in need had safe access to meals. The Grab n Go model continued even after some locations re-opened in summer 2021. Citiparks has also worked with several organizations such as Parkhurst Dining, Eat’n Park, Salvation Army and many others to arrange for additional meal distributions to those in need.  <br>"With all of our Citiparks' Recreation and Senior centers having been closed from March 2020 until just a few months ago due to the pandemic, it's been a tremendous, collaborative effort to have been able to reach this milestone," Citiparks Director Ross Chapman said. "Every team member had committed themselves to ensuring that children and seniors would have free meals available to them from the onset of the pandemic and worked extremely hard, during a very difficult period, to distribute these meals. Naturally, our community partners, program sponsors, and so many others who stepped-in to provide meals, donations and assist us, afforded us the opportunity to be able to have this kind of impact, and we're all so very appreciative of their support. There is no way that we would have been able to have accomplish this without the full support of Mayor Peduto and his Administration, the residents of Pittsburgh and all of the community advocates who came together on this - it's really incredible. Thank you all!" | 22/9/2021 11:57:19 |

| City Releases Ambitious Long Range Mobility Vision Plan for the Next 50 Years of Transportation | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 23, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) has released the 2070 Mobility Vision Plan, a long range vision for the future of mobility in Pittsburgh. The plan provides an ambitious strategic roadmap to maintain past investments, address current disparities and meet future mobility needs with a just, efficient, accessible and sustainable transportation system over the next 50 years.  <br>The 2070 Mobility Vision Plan serves as a guide for infrastructure investment to improve mobility justice and economic growth. It is rooted in DOMI’s core values - safety, equity and resiliency - while planning for a future that will see not only the rapid development of mobility innovation but also the impact of climate change. DOMI staff reviewed projects, plans and community input prepared over the decades and from across the city as the foundation for the project list. Public engagement for the 2070 Mobility Vision Plan reiterated many of these ideas and generated new ones. <br>“When we think about Pittsburgh, we think about innovation and that includes our transportation and mobility networks,” said Mayor William Peduto. “After working with the community to define their vision for the future of transportation in Pittsburgh, DOMI has outlined a strategic path forward of what could be possible in the next five, 20 and 50-years.”  <br>The ambitious long-term plan include large-scale projects, such as an aerial ropeway transit network (gondolas), rapid direct transit to the airport, three new river crossings, an urban terminal for vertical take-off and landing aircraft and high-speed intercity transit. Shorter-term investments in the plan call for ubiquitous and accessible sidewalks, a complete and connected bike(+) network and green infrastructure street retrofits. <br>"It may be tempting to dismiss the 2070 Mobility Vision Plan as fantastical or audacious,” said Director Karina Ricks, “but that would be a mistake. Fifty years is a long time, and a lot will change. Look back at how much has changed over the last fifty. It is critical we have a plan to guide us.”   <br>The 2070 Mobility Vision Plan can be viewed [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/transport-vision-plan). | 23/9/2021 11:19:53 |

| City Rewires Entire City-County Building and Upgrades WiFi Connectivity with 1,000 Times Faster Speeds | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 29, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Innovation and Performance (I&P) and Department of Public Works (DPW) have completed a 15-month, large-scale project to rewire and update the WiFi infrastructure in the City-County Building. This modernization project provides the epicenter of city operations with fast, reliable and wireless data connectivity so that staff can deliver efficient and effective services to the community.   <br>All wiring and equipment were upgraded to modern standards. Prior to the modernization, the City-County Building was operating on a network of outdated technologies with poorly located connectivity distribution points that were overburdened by servicing multiple floors and multiple city departments.  <br>This project included expanding the number of connection points to match the size and network demands of the City-County Building by over 120 access points for a complete and unified WiFi-mesh. Intermediate distribution frames, or areas where connectivity wires are centralized to service areas of the building, were redistributed to each floor to provide improved network service throughout the entire building. The City also upgraded the WiFi technology to Cat6a in order to provide over 1,000 times faster service than before.  <br>“The positive outcomes of this project will be speed of connectivity and the availability to Wi-Fi access,” said Philip Savino, I&P’s Assistant Director of IT Operations. “This project not only includes the modernization of wiring within the building to take care of connection issues but the addition of Wi-Fi that is redundant, reliable and consistent throughout all floors within city operations.” <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15947_IP_GRAPHIC_TWITTER.png) | 30/9/2021 10:45:32 |

| Mayor Peduto Submits Preliminary 2022 City Budgets | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 30, 2021) Mayor William Peduto submitted his preliminary 2022 City Budgets to City Council today, which includes a proposed $611,750,775 Operating Budget and $158,615,392 Capital Budget with no tax increases.  <br>Since Mayor Peduto took office in 2014, he has prioritized responsible fiscal planning to develop long-term financial stability while using north star priorities to guide community-based budgeting, investments and expenditures. Despite the budgetary challenges presented by the pandemic, the 2022 budgets reinforce Mayor Peduto’s commitment to equitable, efficient and effective city operations and record investments in infrastructure.  <br>The investments included in the preliminary budget demonstrate Mayor Peduto’s ongoing priorities, such as:  <br>- Continued record investments in infrastructure improvements like paving, bridges and landslides <br>- Rapid progress towards the city’s sustainability and 2030 Climate Action goals, including the citywide deployment of LED street lights and expanding the city’s fleet of electric vehicles  <br>- Addressing the needs of our underserved communities through the Office of Community Health and Safety and the Office of Community Services and Violence Prevention   <br>- Record investments in the city’s parks, including the first year of citywide parks tax revenue, as well as investments for free parks programs like Rec2Tech, which helps to prepare local youth for interest and careers in the technology sector <br>- Vision Zero street design – creating streets with the vision that no one is hurt in a crash – so that no matter how people get where they’re going, they have safe streets to get there <br>- Continued investments in Avenues of Hope, small businesses and affordable housing initiatives in partnership with the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh so that our neighbors and entrepreneurs have resources to cultivate success in the city <br>This year, the City implemented a tool called ResourceX that allowed for an enhanced data-driven approach to budget decisions centered around equity and climate. City staff created insights within their budget requests on how those requests would help the City achieve both its climate action goals and possible cost reductions citywide. The Sustainability and Resilience Division provided additional guidance on what requests would help achieve Climate Action Plan goals.  <br>“We’ve worked hard over the past seven years to develop and institutionalize a city that works for you and this preliminary budget builds off of the promises I made to our residents as mayor,” said Mayor Peduto. “Because of our years of financial management, we were able to withstand the pandemic without laying off city workers who provide frontline, essential services to all residents. The reality is that we all took a hit and just as our communities are recovering from the beginning of the pandemic, our budgets are too. These budgets do not have frills, but they reinforce my commitment to delivering relief and services that improve our city’s people, performance, place and planet so that our residents have a strong and sustainable city.” <br>The 2022 budgets include pandemic relief funding through the American Rescue Plan and were compiled following a public engagement process through the Office of Community Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget.  <br>The preliminary 2022 Operating Budget is available [here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15951_2022_September_Operating_Budget.pdf) and the Capital Budget is available [here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15950_2022_September_Capital_Budget.pdf).<br>The Peduto Administration will work with City Council members and other City leaders to make adjustments to the preliminary budget before Mayor Peduto formally submits his budget to City Council on Monday, November 8.

The Department of Public Works will work with the Department of Parks and Recreation, who manage the City’s senior centers, to do renovations to the building over the next several years to expand senior programming. <br>“I’d like to thank Mayor Peduto, Chief of Staff Dan Gilman, Public Works Acting Director Chris Hornstein and Parks and Recreation Director Ross Chapman for helping this become a reality for the seniors in the West End and nearby neighborhoods. The center has become an integral part of our community, including serving as a food distribution site during the middle of the pandemic. I’d also like to thank the staff of the senior center who work tirelessly to make this senior center a home away from home for our older neighbors,” said City Council President Theresa Kail-Smith.<br>The center serves hundreds of individuals and the weekly programming includes senior meals, instructor-led workshops, crocheting, painting, exercise activities and more. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the West End Healthy Active Living Center has served 12,620 Grab n Go meals to qualifying seniors. Through a program with Allegheny County, the center has distributed 70 free laptops and are currently hosting computer classes.  <br>"The purchase of the West End Senior Center facility and adjacent property will afford the City an opportunity to reimagine what this center and its offerings might look like in the future,” said Louann Horan, Department of Parks and Recreation Assistant Director of Senior Programming. “Expanded programming, access to additional services and a thriving community of senior members is what we hope to realize. Acquiring this property now allows us to think more creatively and strategically about delivering improved services and support to our seniors." <br>The City will be purchasing the property for $374,000 total and the acquisition will be presented to City Council tomorrow for their approval. | 4/10/2021 15:37:52 |
| Opportunity for Local Startups to Pilot Solutions for Local Government Open with PGH Lab 7.0 | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 4, 2021) Applications are open today for the seventh cohort of PGH Lab, a Peduto Administration program run by the Department of Innovation and Performance to create partnerships between city government and local startups.  <br>PGH Lab connects local startup companies with the City of Pittsburgh and local authorities to test new products and services in a real world environment for up to six months. In the program, startups are encouraged to test, gain valuable market feedback and iterate. In turn, the program gives city government the opportunity to explore new ways to use technology and services to make government more efficient, transparent, sustainable and inclusive.  <br>PGH Lab was established in 2016 and the City and partnering agencies have successfully completed six cycles engaging over 30 local startups who have provided innovative pilot projects from waste management to immigrant inclusion solutions.  <br>In 2020, PGH Lab focused on technology solutions through an equity lens with six of the eight participating companies owned by underrepresented communities in tech including race, ethnicity, gender, LGBTQIA+ diversity and people with disabilities. Companies spent a total of 2,475 hours testing ideas and solutions with city departments and agencies.

| Westinghouse Park Becomes Nationally Recognized Certified Arboretum | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 6, 2021) Mayor William Peduto joined the Department of Public Works Forestry Division, Tree Pittsburgh, Westinghouse Park 2nd Century Coalition and other community groups and members in Point Breeze North’s Westinghouse Park today to celebrate the park becoming the second certified City park arboretum on George Westinghouse’s 175th Birthday.  <br>Westinghouse Park has been awarded a Level I accreditation by the ArbNet Arboretum Accreditation Program and the Morton Arboretum, for achieving and maintaining nationally-recognized standards of professional practices important for arboreta and botanic gardens. Westinghouse Park is now also included in the Morton Register of Arboreta, a database of the world’s arboreta and gardens dedicated to woody plants. <br>The park’s namesake, George Westinghouse, was born 175 years ago on October 6, 1846 and revolutionized the railroad industry with his railroad air brake system that gave engineers a way to quickly and reliably stop trains. He was an inventor and visionary businessman with over 361 patents and 62 companies. In 1871, he and his wife purchased the land that would become Westinghouse Park and it was donated for public use to the City of Pittsburgh in 1918.  <br>Westinghouse Park is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places and the community has recently completed community engagement and planning for park restoration, maintenance and improvements in anticipation of developing a master plan with the Department of City Planning next year.  <br>The Forestry Division has placed temporary informational banners on trees throughout Westinghouse Park for the community to learn more about the native trees in the park. There will also be a [community celebration](https://firemancreative.net/fireman-creative-whats-the-point-5k/) in the park on Saturday, October 9, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., which will include a .5K community run, tree pickup sponsored by Tree Pittsburgh, a video about George Westinghouse and information from the Breathe Project and Group Against Smog and Pollution (GASP). | 6/10/2021 13:29:19 |
| Partial Closure of Bausman Street for Traffic Calming Installation | Partial Closure of Bausman Street for Traffic Calming <br>PITTSBURGH, PA (October 6, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is pleased to announce the installation of traffic calming measures on Bausman Street from Bernd Street to Brownsville Road. Data collected during the Fall of 2020 indicated that 82% of vehicles traveling on Bausman Street exceed the posted speed limit of 25 mph, with an 85th percentile speed of 35 mph. Coupled with a long crash history, this rate of speeding indicated a strong need for a traffic calming intervention.<br>The project will include the construction of three speed humps on Bausman Street. Permanent signage and pavement markings will be installed to alert motorists of approaching speed humps. Speed humps are midblock traffic calming devices that raise the entire wheelbase of a vehicle to reduce its speed.<br>Work is tentatively expected to begin the week of October 9-13, 2021, and is expected to last two days, weather permitting. Hours of construction will be Monday through Saturday 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. One lane of traffic on Bausman Street will be closed to traffic, with flaggers stationed at each intersection in order to allow local traffic access to and from their residences. Temporary no parking signage will be posted at each speed hump location.<br>Thank you for your cooperation during this time. We hope there will be only minor inconveniences. If you have any questions or require further information regarding this closure you may contact the City’s Response Center by calling 311 or 412-255-2621.<br>If you have questions about this project or other traffic calming projects, you may contact us by email at trafficcalming@pittsburghpa.gov.

| City Receives $90,000 USDA Grant to Pilot Community Composting Projects | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 7. 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has received a $90,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for a [Community Compost and Food Waste Reduction pilot](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/newsroom/releases/?cid=NRCSEPRD1833032). The grant will fund a two-year pilot project to develop and test strategies for planning and implementing municipal compost and food waste reduction plans, starting with City facilities and events.  <br>The City’s pilot will focus on gathering research about composting in the region and implementing three composting solutions to see which are viable with city operations to later scale up - public composting at City events, a mechanical composter and traditional compost methods at City facilities.<br>The first year of the pilot will focus on conducting exploratory research about food waste systems and composting in the greater Pittsburgh area to understand what programs, education, businesses and resources exist to manage food waste commercially and on the community level. The City will use this information to design pilot projects that complement and support the growth of food waste systems already existing in the area.  <br>The second year of the pilot will focus on testing new composting opportunities at City facilities and events. As part of this, the City will seek a local, licensed composting business through a competitive application process to manage an organic composting booth at City-sponsored farmers’ markets, where visitors can bring their compost and vendors will receive support to transition products to “compost compatible” to host zero-waste markets.  <br>The City will also pilot two internal composting food operations at a recreation center and a senior center, both of which host food programs, in the hopes that the projects will be able to expanded to accept community compost.  The Philips Recreation Center in Carrick will employ a traditional composting method. Traditional composting requires layering two types of organic materials (“browns” like dried yard debris, leaves, shredded cardboard; and “greens” like fruit food scraps, vegetables, grass clippings), which will break down over time into a soil-like substance used for planting. The composting pilot will also be used for education programming with youth at the center.  <br>The Homewood Healthy Active Living (Senior) Center will pilot mechanical composting, where organic and compostable materials are put in a vessel, like a drum or silo, and spun or turned regularly to assist with the breakdown of materials to also become a soil-like substance used for planting.  <br>Though a large-scale citywide composting program is not currently viable for the City, this pilot will be the first step in designing composting opportunities that can be expanded to the community as part of the [Climate Action Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/climate-action-plan). Composting activities will increase access to compost for agricultural producers, improve soil quality and encourage innovative food systems waste management plans that reduce and divert food waste from landfills.  <br>The project is a collaboration between several city departments, led by the Department of City Planning’s Sustainability and Resilience Division, Department of Parks and Recreation and Office of Special Events, as well as outside agencies. | 7/10/2021 12:34:07 |

| Salem's Market Selected to Open a Grocery Store in Hill District's Centre Heldman Plaza | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 11, 2021) Mayor William Peduto has announced that the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) will enter lease negotiations with locally-owned and family-run Salem’s Market & Grill, LLC to open a grocery store in the former SHOP ‘n SAVE site at the Centre Heldman Plaza in the Hill District. The URA selected Salem’s following a community process coordinated with City Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle and the Hill Community Development Corporation (CDC). <br>“I am grateful to all those who participated in the thorough process with the Hill community to identify a grocery store partner who will serve the needs of the community and be a hub tenant in the Centre Heldman Plaza and Centre Avenue business district,” said Mayor Peduto. “Salem’s has a proven record for providing high quality food and products and supporting our minority communities. We look forward to working with them on this expansion project.”  <br>Interested grocery stores and markets submitted applications to be considered to fill the vacant grocery store site. Four finalist applicants [presented to the community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jSqeKze-JM) last month as part of the Hill CDC’s [Development Review Panel](https://www.hilldistrict.org/score), where residents shared their views and preferences by filling out an online scorecard for each candidate.  <br>Based on the scorecards, the URA announced this week that they have selected Salem’s, who received the highest rating from the local community. Salem's Market & Grill has been a locally-run minority-owned business for over 40 years, with their original store located on Penn Avenue in the Strip District. Their application highlighted how they could collaborate with and contribute to the Hill District community after reviewing the Greater Hill District Master Plan and Centre Avenue Redevelopment and Design Plan. <br>“Salem's Market locating to the Hill District is a tremendous win both for Salem's and the Hill District community,” said Councilman Lavelle. “It affords Salem's the ability to grow and expand, while providing the community with a much-needed grocery store and restaurant. What's more, given Salem's well established customer base, the new grocery store and restaurant will bring considerable foot traffic to Centre Avenue, which will help support efforts underway to build back Centre Avenue as a business corridor.” <br>Some of the benefits they believe that they can bring to complement the neighborhood include: <br>- Stocking fresh produce, meat, seafood, deli, snacks, drinks, international foods, household items, wholesale items, baby and infant care products, pet food and supplies, pharmacy and beauty products, prepared foods and more <br>- Hosting a career fair to hire the 50-75 person staff in the neighborhood that includes a butcher and chef training program <br>- Dedicating retail space for products from local vendors  <br>- Hiring local trade contractors and minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs) for construction  <br>- Partnering with local community organizations to develop and promote entrepreneurial programming that helps start, support and grow local businesses <br>- Attracting shoppers from across the region to visit the Centre Avenue business district  <br>“The URA purchased the Centre Heldman Plaza to ensure there is a transparent conversation about which grocery store would best fit the needs of the Hill District community,” said URA Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker. “We want to thank Mayor Peduto, Councilman Lavelle and the Hill CDC for committing to a community-centered process that continues our recent record of revitalizing the Hill District with local, minority-owned businesses. We look forward to entering into good-faith lease negotiations with Salem’s.”   <br>The City, URA and Councilman Lavelle have worked closely with the Hill community to attract community-driven tenants to the Centre Heldman Plaza, including [CARES CommuniTEA Café](https://www.restaurantji.com/pa/pittsburgh/cares-communitea-cafe-/), Catapult Minority Business Incubator and G’s Closet.

| URA Closes on $500,000 Loan to Help Bring Music Back to James Street in East Allegheny Neighborhood | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 11, 2021) The Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) has closed on a $500,000 loan to 422 Foreland LLC, the owner of the former James Street Gastropub and Speakeasy at the corner of Foreland and James Streets in the East Allegheny neighborhood. They purchased the property in 2018 and are investing over $5 million total to revitalize the property and the loan from the URA’s Pittsburgh Business Fund will assist in funding gaps stemming from the pandemic.  <br>The 123 year-old, 18,700 square foot building formerly served as a neighborhood meeting place as well as drew music lovers from all over to enjoy the historic prohibition-era structure and live jazz and other music. The renovation will create a mixed-used commercial building including a restaurant, office space, apartment and the return of jazz.<br>“This is a historic property that transformed into a place where music lovers can come to hear good live music and build community,” said Mayor William Peduto. “When James Street closed its doors, the community was clear that they wanted music to come back and we promised we’d make that happen. I’d like to thank Jonathan Iams and his team and the URA for helping to fulfill that promise and bring jazz back to James and Foreland.” <br>The renovations are currently underway and the owner, Jonathan Iams, anticipates occupancy in February 2022. They have worked closely with the Northside Leadership Conference and East Allegheny Community Council and the project intends to bring professional and hospitality jobs, restore the historic building to a vibrant community asset and bring community life back to the building.  <br>”The James Street Tavern has been the home of jazz in Pittsburgh for more than half a century,” said owner Jonathan Iams. “I am excited to see the building thrive again as a place for the community to enjoy great food, music and art in an architecturally significant building.” <br>The URA also assisted the new owners in applying for Enterprise Zone (EZ) Tax Credits through the state, an incentive program that provides tax credits to businesses investing in real property improvements such as rehab, expansion or physical improvements to buildings or land resulting in jobs created in designated areas. <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16041_James_Street_Tavern_Rendering_(1).jpg)<br>_Architectural rending of building addition from James Street, provided by 422 Foreland LLC._ | 11/10/2021 11:10:28 |

| URA to Sell Beechview Property to Casa San Jose for a Community Revitalization Project to Serve Residents | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 12, 2021) The Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) Board of Directors will vote this week on a resolution to authorize entering an option agreement for the sale of 1602-1606 Broadway Avenue in Beechview to [Casa San José](https://casasanjose.org/), a local organization that provides support and resources for Latinx immigrants and community members in Pittsburgh.  <br>1602-1606 Broadway Avenue, located in the Broadway Avenue business district, has stood vacant and the community has advocated for its revitalization. Casa San José intends to redevelop the property, using the top floors for their offices and the lower level for a community gathering space and programming for all ages.  <br>"The growing Hispanic community is so grateful for the dedication that Mayor Peduto has and continues to display to our community,” said Monica Ruiz, Executive Director of Casa San José. “He has been a champion on immigrant rights and inclusion. This building is just one additional way he has proven his commitment to our communities.”  <br>Casa San José's bilingual staff offer critical support to Latinx and other community residents including access to Immigrant Services and Connections (ISAC) social services, emergency response, advocacy, ESL classes, mental health programs, nutrition programs, youth organizations, activities, camps, academic support and more. Casa San José has partnered with the City on several initiatives to support the immigrant community citywide, including the [disbursement of funding to residents who did not receive federal stimulus payments](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4099).  <br>Initial plans for the redevelopment include updating the building with an elevator, stair tower and other ADA-compliant improvements. The City of Pittsburgh has allocated $1 million of American Rescue Plan funding through the URA for the project and Casa San José expects to raise the additional funding.  <br>If approved, the URA would sell the property to Casa San José for $1 plus costs. | 12/10/2021 09:50:44 |

| Pittsburgh Awarded Three Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to Bring Over 112 Affordable Housing Units to Allentown, Fairywood and Hill District | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 14, 2021) Governor Tom Wolf and the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency board announced today that three City of Pittsburgh affordable housing developments will be receiving tax credits this year.  <br>The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is a critical resource to support the development and rehabilitation of affordable housing to provide low-income families with quality housing at lower rents. LIHTC provides an annual tax credit for owners of affordable rental properties for their first 10 years of operation and properties must be affordable for at least 30 years. Developers use the tax credits to raise equity from investors to finance the project.  <br>These three additional tax credit awards continue a record run of LIHTC allocations for the city after Mayor William Peduto met with Governor Wolf to advocate an increase in awards to Pittsburgh.  <br>The projects awarded today were supported by over $1.5 million in preliminary commitments from the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) to provide gap funding as part of their applications.  <br>"Providing high quality affordable housing has been a top priority of my administration and we are grateful to Governor Wolf and our partners in Harrisburg for helping to bring additional tax credits to Pittsburgh,” said Mayor Peduto. “Collaboration of partners from all sectors is critical to meet the need for housing in our city and I thank the URA and development partners for creating an additional 112 affordable units for people and families.” <br>The redevelopment projects receiving the credits are:  <br>- **Cedarwood Homes** in Fairywood by Cedarwood Homes, LLC and Tryko Partners for the new construction of 46 mixed income, garden style apartments in the Fairywood neighborhood with senior occupancy. (total 46 units; 39 affordable) <br>- **Letsche School and Townhomes** by Catalyst Communities, LLC for the adaptive reuse of a historic school building and new construction of four adjacent townhomes for 46 mixed income units in the Hill District.

| City Seeking Local Landcare Businesses to Manage City-Owned Properties to Remediate Neighborhood Blight | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 15, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh is seeking qualified land care and maintenance businesses to submit applications to assist in the year-round land maintenance of city-owned properties and lots. The City is looking to partner with locally-owned businesses to provide land care to remediate blight in neighborhoods citywide.  <br>Outside of city parks maintenance, the City contracts land maintenance work to outside vendors and developed this program to invest money into community-based businesses to provide solutions for blighted city-owned properties at a competitive pay rate of $25 per hour.  <br>The program would assign over 4,400 properties that have been divided geographically into “bundles” of around 200 properties each to multiple businesses. Upon application, businesses can indicate their preferred geographic bundles and how many bundles they are able to manage. Bundles will be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis.   <br>Qualified vendors will be responsible for all properties in their assigned bundle(s) and are expected to visit each property at least monthly throughout the year to cut grass, remove litter, weed perimeters, trim tree branches and remove debris. Additional visits may be requested by the City based on community concerns or 311 requests about specific properties.  <br>The land maintenance program is an initiative of the Office of Mayor William Peduto and the Department of Finance. Vendors will regularly report their progress to the Department of Finance.  <br>Starting today, applications are being accepted [here](https://webprocure.perfect.com/wp-web-public/#/bidboard/bid/91234?customerid=39) on a rolling basis on [Beacon](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html), the City’s online procurement platform.  <br>Interested businesses are invited to attend one of three informational meeting to learn more about the program before applying, hosted by the Office of Community Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget Procurement Division.

| Traffic Calming Installation Coming to East Hills Drive and Wilner Drive | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 15, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is pleased to announce the installation of traffic calming measures on East Hills Drive between Foch Way and Calistoga Place and on Wilner Drive from East Hills Drive to Bracey Drive in the city's East Hills neighborhood. Data collected during the Spring of 2021 indicated that 54% of vehicles traveling on East Hills Drive exceeded the posted speed limit of 25 mph, with an 85th percentile speed of 33 mph. 61% of vehicles traveling on Wilner Drive exceed the posted speed limit of 25 mph, with an 85th percentile speed of 33 mph. Coupled with a long crash history, this rate of speeding indicated a strong need for traffic calming intervention.<br>The project will include the construction of two speed humps on East Hills Drive and two speed humps on Wilner Drive. Permanent signage and pavement markings will be installed to alert motorists of approaching speed humps. Speed humps are midblock traffic calming devices that raise the entire wheelbase of a vehicle to reduce its speed.<br>Work is tentatively expected to begin the week of October 16-22, 2021, and is expected to last two days, weather permitting. Hours of construction will be Monday through Saturday 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. One lane of traffic on East Hills Drive and Wilner Drive will be closed to traffic, with flaggers stationed at each intersection in order to allow local traffic access to and from their residences. Temporary no parking signage will be posted at each speed hump location.<br>Thank you for your cooperation during this time and we hope there will be only minor inconveniences. If you have any questions or require further information regarding this closure you may contact the City’s Response Center by calling 311 or 412-255-2621.

| Traffic Circles Construction to Begin on North Euclid | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 18, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) will complete three neighborhood traffic circles along North Euclid Avenue, starting the week of October 18, 2021. Construction is anticipated to last one week, weather permitting. Traffic will not be detoured. Flaggers will allow drivers to navigate through the construction zones safely.<br>The traffic circles will complete the “North Euclid Neighborway” project, helping to turn the street, an important link between East Liberty and Highland Park, into a shared, low volume, low speed, traffic-calmed street where vulnerable bicycles can safely travel together with vehicles. Planning and outreach for this project occurred primarily during 2020 and the first four circles in the corridor were installed in spring 2021. The delay of the construction of the last three circles was the result of coordination with PWSA’s planned upgrades on the street; these coordination concerns have since been resolved.<br>These new circles will be built on North Euclid at the intersections of Wellesley Avenue, Jackson Street and Hayes Street. These three circles will complete the corridor, supplementing the four concrete circles at the North Euclid Avenue intersections of Hampton Street, Elgin Street, Callowhill Street and Rippey Street installed at the beginning of the construction season.<br>Neighborhood traffic circles fit within the existing curb line of an intersection, do not require any additional property, do not require any parking removal, meet ADA accessibility standards and have mountable curbs to enable larger vehicles such as buses or emergency vehicles to traverse them even while subtly diverting the path of travel of the more common passenger vehicle.<br>Thank you for your cooperation during this time. We hope there will be only minor inconveniences. If you have any questions or require further information regarding this closure you may contact the City’s Response Center by calling 311 or 412-255-2621.<br>If you have questions about this project or other DOMI Move Forward bike projects, you may contact us by email at moveforward@gmail.com.

| City Financial Practices Create Fiscal Resilience | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 18, 2021) The Office of Mayor William Peduto and Office of Management and Budget have released financial data about the resilient financial cash reserve practices of the administration that have led to enhanced fiscal management and reliability for the City, especially in the face of the pandemic, that will be needed to guide the City’s continued recovery.

Mayor Peduto has long been a leading voice for financial management improvements for the City. When he served as City Councilman, he recognized that the City was in financial distress and proposed the City enter Act 47 state financial oversight, but at that time he could not get anyone to second his proposal. In 2004, Mayor Peduto successfully sponsored the legislation for the City to enter Act 47, which led to controls on spending, increased taxes and the adoption of fiscal reforms.

Mayor Peduto helped to write all three Act 47 financial recovery plans in 2004, 2009 and 2014, including when he served as City Council Finance Committee Chair. In addition, he institutionalized Act 47 financial practices by introducing and passing fiscal City Code and ordinance reforms to ensure that the City continues to follow and strengthen its responsible financial practices to avoid financial distress in the future following the City’s [exit from Act 47](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/1475) in February 2018.

Since 2014, Mayor Peduto has focused on strengthening the City’s cash reserves in order to be prepared for financial shocks, while still budgeting for record investments in community-based capital projects and infrastructure.

Responsible financial management of the cash reserves, sometimes called a “rainy day fund," allowed the City to sustain the financial disruption of the pandemic without having to lay off employees who provide essential public services. When there are additional monies in the city’s operating budget, some of that money is transferred to the capital budget for critical infrastructure and asset projects and the rest is put into the reserves at the end of each fiscal year.

The following data reflects the total reserve funds for the past seven years. Decreases in year-to-year funding are attributed to increased funds being transferred to important capital projects and investments. For example, the decrease from 2017 to 2018 includes the city’s establishment of the Housing Opportunity Fund which saw a $10 million transfer to the fund.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Fiscal Year | Ending Fund Balance |
| 2014 | $58,590,162.42 |
| 2015 | $56,113,162.33 |
| 2016 | $78,828,682.90 |
| 2017 | $97,243,093.55 |
| 2018 | $96,146,658.87 |
| 2019 | $120,307,451.04 |
| 2020 | $75,645,904.26 |
| 2021\* | $75,424,703.00 |

“Thanks to our ability to have funding in our reserves, we were able to sustain city operations throughout the pandemic until we received the federal relief that I advocated for with the American Rescue Plan so that we didn’t lose critical city services that our neighbors depend on. It was the rainy day that we were prepared for,” said Mayor Peduto. “Our long-term financial recovery will continue to feel the stresses of the pandemic over the next few years and our recovery depends on rebuilding the cash reserves over that time to be a resilient city that will be prepared to face whatever the next challenge will be.”

The current five-year financial forecasts suggest that the financial strains of the pandemic will continue to threaten City budgets. Through Mayor Peduto’s planning and City Council’s leadership, the American Rescue Plan funding for city services and personnel will support City budgets until 2023. To continue a strong financial position, the City must control spending while also focusing on adding jobs in Pittsburgh’s new economy and growing residents with additional housing stock. Without spending controls and meaningful revenue growth, the City will again find itself in financial hardship.

| Mayor William Peduto Issues Statement on Congressman Mike Doyle's Announcement | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 18, 2021) Mayor William Peduto issued the following statement today in response to U.S. Congressman Mike Doyle's announcement he will not be seeking re-election:<br>“Congressman Mike Doyle has been a model of public service since he took office in 1995. Throughout his long and distinguished career, he has led our region through financial hardship, pivoting economies, new technologies and a global pandemic. He has always put the people of Pittsburgh first and ensured that our residents and neighborhoods had the federal support they needed for investments, improvements and services. He has been a leader, an advocate and a friend to all of our communities as well as to his colleagues on both sides of the aisle in Washington, D.C.  <br>Congressman Doyle, thank you for using your compassion, skills, talent and diplomacy to make Pittsburgh a better place now and in the future.” | 18/10/2021 16:27:16 |
| City to Free Up Public Safety Facilities for Community Redevelopment Through Lease of Steamfitters Local Union 449 Building | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 19, 2021) Mayor William Peduto introduced legislation to City Council today to lease the former Steamfitters Local Union 449 at 1517 Woodruff Street. The City intends to use this facility to consolidate police operations currently housed in a former fire station in Troy Hill, a former school in Elliott, a former fire station in the Hill District and replace an expiring lease for warehouse storage in the North Side.  <br>Moving multiple operations into one location not only improves efficiency and saves money, but also provides the City the opportunity to get properties back on the tax rolls, end existing leases and redevelop properties to create and enhance neighborhood assets in partnership with the community. For example, the City plans to redevelop Thaddeus Stevens School in Elliott into a community recreation center for youth and will work with the Troy Hill community to determine how market the old fire station in their business district for investment and redevelopment.<br>“I’d like to thank Mayor Peduto, Chief of Staff Gilman, Director Hissrich and Chief Schubert for helping to create an opportunity for our communities to reclaim and redevelop city-owned buildings in our neighborhoods to meet the needs of the residents. Our children and families in Elliott and the surrounding communities are looking forward to having a recreation center,” said City Council President Theresa Kail-Smith. “It’s also an opportunity to streamline specialty police operations under one roof and we are grateful to welcome this addition to District 2.” | 19/10/2021 14:25:09 |

| Pittsburgh Continues to Receive Strong Credit Ratings Due to Financial Practices | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 19, 2021) The Office of Mayor William Peduto and the Office of Management and Budget today released information about the improved strength of the City’s bond credit rating. The City’s fiscal planning and resiliency strategy over the past seven years turned a structurally deficient budget into a model of fiscal strength, including strong credit ratings that allow the City to borrow capital budget funds at a better rate to save taxpayers money.

“Just like individuals, having a good credit score can help get better rates or higher limits for cities to issue bonds for critical infrastructure improvements,” Mayor Peduto said. “Pittsburgh has worked hard over the past several years to improve its credit ratings and outlooks so that we can continue to put money into reserves, invest in our pension fund and also pursue projects that are important to maintain and support our city and our communities.”

Mayor Peduto has long lead efforts to improve financial management for the City, including during his time on City Council. His continued advocacy included sponsoring legislation for the City to enter Act 47 state oversight, helping to write all three Act 47 recovery plans and ensuring continued fiscal stability and growth through codifying financial reforms. His legacy of financial vitality practices have ensured the City has avoided financial distress after exiting Act 47 and that the City’s bond credit ratings have strengthened.

The success of the city’s financial management has been recognized by independent financial rating agencies as the City’s ratings have improved over the past seven years. In 2021, S&P Global Ratings awarded Pittsburgh strong creditworthiness despite the pandemic:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S&P Credit Rating History |
| Issuance/Year | Credit Rating | Outlook |
| 2012 Series A/B | BBB | Stable |
| Series 2014 | AA | Stable |
| 2014 Refunding Series A/B | A+ | Stable |
| Series 2017 | A+ | Stable |
| Series 2019 | AA- | Stable |
| Series 2020 | AA- | Stable |
| 2020 Refunding Series A/B | AA- | Stable |
| Series 2021 | AA- | Stable |

Bond rating agencies have praised the City’s management of its budget before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A credit rating of “A” indicates above-average creditworthiness relative to other U.S. municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues, while “AA” indicates very strong creditworthiness.

According to S&P’s quality levels, the City of Pittsburgh was upgraded, and since maintained, from upper medium grade to high quality in 2017, indicating that the financial safeguards and practices implemented by the Peduto Administration improved and have continued to improve the financial strength of the City.

The ratings provided by Fitch Credit Rating, another independent financial rating agency, reflect the increased strength of the City’s increased creditworthiness, having upgraded the City from an upper medium grade rating to high quality credit rating between 2012 and 2021.

|     |     |     |

Though Fitch Credit Rating recognizes the current strength of the City’s credit rating, a negative outlook was issued for 2020 and 2021 as five-year financial forecasts suggest that the financial strains of the pandemic will continue to threaten municipal budgets. Mayor Peduto’s financial planning and City Council’s leadership for American Rescue Plan funding will support the predicted deficits for city services and personnel until 2023. To continue a strong financial position, the City must control spending while also focusing on adding jobs to Pittsburgh’s new economy and growing residents with additional housing stock. Without spending controls and meaningful revenue growth, the City will again find itself in financial hardship.

The City requires credit reports from two agencies in order to pursue bond issuance. A third independent agency, Moody’s, has consistently issued the City upper medium grade ratings in 2014, 2017 and 2019, but has not issued Pittsburgh a recent credit rating. | 19/10/2021 13:15:46 |
| DOMI Receives Over $560,000 for Street Safety Improvement Projects | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 19, 2021) The Office of Mayor William Peduto has announced that the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) has received over $560,000 in grant funding for three street safety and traffic improvement projects that support [Mayor Peduto’s Complete Streets and Vision Zero policies](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/1090) to ensure that all people traveling in the city- like pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, transit riders and more – can safely get to their destination regardless of their mode of travel. The projects also support the City’s [Climate Action Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/climate-action-plan) by enhancing efficiency and therefore reducing emissions in residential and business corridors.  <br>DOMI’s Traffic Management Center project has received $266,736 from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) through their Green Light-Go Grant Program, which will fund fiber network infrastructure that will connect the center to traffic signals citywide. The important project marks the City’s first Traffic Management Center that will allow DOMI to remotely manage, monitor and adjust all traffic signals from a centralized location to improve safety and efficiency routinely and during special events.  <br>An additional $132,000 from PennDOT’s Green Light-Go program will complement efforts by the Traffic Management Center by funding the East End Signal Retiming Project. As the Baum Blvd, Centre Avenue and Penn Avenue corridors have seen an increase in population, businesses, residential units and walkable destinations, this project will retime 50 traffic signals to match the current needs of the corridors. It will enhance flow and adapt the lights to accommodate the growing number of pedestrians, bicyclists, scooter riders, public transit and vehicles accessing the corridor while reducing emissions in these densely populated areas.  <br>DOMI has also received a total of $162,000 from the Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County for the Homewood Complete Streets Planning project. This project is part of the [Homewood Active Mobility Improvement Pla](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/homewood-active-mobility-improvement-plan) [n](http://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/homewood-active-mobility-improvement-plan) and will focus on making improvements the community has identified to increase their ability to safely navigate their neighborhood. Improvements include infrastructure like roads and sidewalks, traffic calming, access to public transportation as well as recreational, religious, educational and business destinations so that all people have a safe way to get where they’re going.  <br>The grants have been presented to City Council today. | 19/10/2021 12:02:41 |
| Police to Open Zone 3 Substation in South Side to Promote Community Safety | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 20, 2021) The Office of Mayor William Peduto and the Department of Public Safety announced today that the City has started construction and will be opening a Zone 3 Police substation in the former South Side police station on South 18th Street.  <br>Instead of having to respond and commute between the South Side nighttime entertainment district and the main Zone 3 office in Allentown, police staff will be able to operate out of the Zone 3 substation during times like weekends when they are typically dispatched to the South Side in high volume. Located off of East Carson Street, officers will be able to use the space for breaks, to do paperwork and respond more efficiently to calls for service in the area.  <br>“The opening of this substation is exciting as our neighbors and businesses in the South Side have called for increased patrols to protect the safety of our community of residents and visitors," said City Councilman Bruce Kraus. "Models like this help officers to be able to walk the beat and become familiar with the community, which builds trust. I’d like to thank Mayor Peduto and the Police Bureau for making this a priority so that all who live in and visit our neighborhood can have a safe and enjoyable experience.”   <br>"The addition of a Pittsburgh Police facility in the South Side flats will provide a more accessible point of contact for residents, businesses, and visitors to the area,” said Pubic Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. “A police substation will afford officers a safe and quiet space to conduct interviews, complete necessary paperwork and take reports. It will also provide a respite for officers working long hours in the busy South Side corridor. I would like to thank Councilman Kraus and the Department of Public Works for recognizing the importance of this facility and for expediting the project. It will be another valuable resource for Pittsburgh Police to enhance public safety on the South Side." <br>The City of Pittsburgh introduced the substation model in order to provide additional support in areas that host large-scale events or entertainment districts that require additional patrols during certain times and neighborhoods that have called for community-based policing. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police currently operates substations in Downtown and Northview Heights, both of which have been successful in expanding the bureau’s community-based policing strategy.  <br>Construction has begun to renovate the building and is funded through the American Rescue Plan to promote community safety. The South Side substation is expected to open in 2022 and the City plans to open another substation next year in Homewood. The Bureau hopes to open substations in each of the six police zones. | 20/10/2021 11:51:43 |
| City Pension Fund Hits Milestone at Nearly 72% Funded | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 20, 2021) Under the financial leadership of Mayor William Peduto, both as mayor and during his time on City Council, the City has made important progress in strengthening the Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund (CMFPTF), which provides retirement pension benefits to city staff who provide essential public services to the residents of Pittsburgh.

The City of Pittsburgh and CMPTF Board of Directors is responsible for funding the retirement benefits for three pension funds for city employees through the CMPTF. The fund is managed by a board of peer-elected city staff representatives and is subsidized through employees’ bimonthly contributions, allocation of state aid and the City’s annual contribution. The plans are funded by the City on an annual basis and State Act 205 requires that minimum annual contributions be based upon the calculation of the Minimum Municipal Obligation (MMO).

The strength of a pension fund can be measured in the percentage it is funded by the municipality, which signifies its solvency and sustainability. In 2010, the CMPTF was in distress being funded only 27%. In an effort to protect the pension investments of hardworking city employees, Mayor Peduto, with the leadership of City Council and City Controller Michael Lamb, committed to improving the strength of the fund.

The pension fund was 57.69% funded when Mayor Peduto took office in 2014 and has grown due to the mayor’s annual pension fund contributions that far exceed the state-mandated MMO. In 2020, the MMO called for $51.5 million, but the City contributed a total $99 million. This year, the MMO calls for $52.2 million, but the City will contribute an additional $46 million above the MMO. As a result of this commitment, the fund has hit a new milestone at 72% funded.

“Our pension funds have hit a historic milestone and it could not have happened without the commitment of our Finance team, City Council and the City Controller. I especially want to thank CMPTF Chairman Ralph Sicuro and the CMPTF Board of Directors for their dedication to fighting for and protecting the retirement of their fellow city employees,” said Mayor Peduto.

CMPTF Chairperson Ralph Sicuro added, “The City has followed the Actuarially Recommended Contribution (ARC) which exceeds the MMO set by the state’s Act 205 requirements. The commitment of funding our pensions by following the ARC recommendation over the MMO requirements must continue now and into the future.”

This table outlines the City’s total contributions to the CMPTF and includes the amount contributed over the MMO:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Year** | **Total Contributed** | **Minimum Municipal Obligation** | **Amount Contributed Over MMO** |
| 2015 | $60,858,477 | $42,860,296 | $17,998,181 |
| 2016 | $63,382,560 | $43,073,288 | $20,309,272 |
| 2017 | $70,487,381 | $49,202,651 | $21,284,730 |
| 2018 | $86,414,394 | $49,662,394 | $36,752,000 |
| 2019 | $94,333,652 | $51,011,799 | $43,321,853 |
| 2020 | $99,099,273 | $51,519,388 | $47,579,885 |
| 2021 | $98,819,645 | $52,264,801 | $46,554,844 |

“It’s critical that the City to continue to exceed expectations of investment into the pension fund,” continued Mayor Peduto. “We have employees who commit their whole careers to providing public and essential services to the city and they and their families should not be concerned about the stability of their pension because of the political financial mismanagement of others.” | 20/10/2021 11:45:03 |

| City Selects The Efficiency Network for LED Streetlight Conversion and Installation Project for Over $1 Million Annual Energy Savings | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 26, 2021) The Office of Mayor William Peduto has announced that Pittsburgh-based The Efficiency Network (TEN) has been selected for the citywide LED streetlight conversion project. The project will convert the City’s existing inventory of 35,000 overhead streetlights to LED in order to save over $1 million a year in energy cost, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create union jobs and generate workforce development opportunities. New streetlights will comply with the City’s newly passed [Dark Skies Lighting standards](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/5207) to reduce light pollution and aid in a healthy natural environment for people, animals and bird migration. <br>The $16 million project will deliver LED lights that are more durable and reduce energy consumption by 40-50% based on the U.S. Department of Energy and industry standards and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on the reduced consumption of electricity. The project will also reduce the costs and frequency of outages and replacements and provide a fully functional turnkey system that will include data collection and data analysis. <br>Throughout the second half of 2020 and early 2021, Pittsburgh’s Departments of Mobility & Infrastructure (DOMI) and Innovation & Performance (I&P) contracted with the company Cyclomedia to conduct a full photographic survey of the city’s utility poles and streetlights, leading to the first ever full geographic database of Pittsburgh’s streetlights. With this data, the City was able to estimate how many new lights might be needed to address equity concerns related to the availability of street lighting in city neighborhoods. With funding from the American Rescue Plan, the City will add up to 15,000 additional new lights to address areas of lighting inequities. <br>TEN will also be providing workforce development opportunities as part of the project, including their partnership with the A. Philip Randolph Institute to connect young people to vocations and offer multiple pathways for employment after the project is complete. Additionally they are creating new apprenticeship funnel program with Pittsburgh Public Schools CTE program that will have a curriculum created by TEN, Duquesne Light Company, IBEW Local #5 and Local #29. TEN will deliver this project utilizing the trains local workforce provided by IBEW Local #5. <br>“TEN cannot be more honored to support the City of Pittsburgh in making this significant infrastructure improvement that will benefit all city residents,” said Troy Geanopulos, CEO of TEN. “In addition to improving the quality of lighting throughout the city and saving it valuable funds, we will use the opportunity to work with the A. Phillip Randolph Institute to identify and train city residents to support some of the workforce needs of the project.” <br>The public is encouraged to learn more about the project and stay up to date with project updates and opportunities for engagement and comment through the City’s online public engagement portal, EngagePGH, [here](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/streetlights). <br>The project is being managed by DOMI in collaboration with I&P, Office of Management and Budget and Department of City Planning’s Sustainability and Resilience Division. Installation is expected to start in spring 2022 and should take two and a half years to complete. | 26/10/2021 14:21:17 |

| City Recognizes Nearly $27 Million in Affordable Housing Developments in East Liberty | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 28, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh joined partners Trek Development Group, Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP), Urban Redevelopment of Pittsburgh (URA) and community members, including representatives from the Penn Plaza Support and Action Coalition and East Liberty Development Inc. (ELDI), today to officially open the Mellons Orchard South and break ground on the Harvard Beatty Housing development projects.  <br>Both development projects were designed in partnership with the community according to the vision laid out in the East Liberty Community Plan, which outlines redeveloping vacant land closer to the business district, providing diverse housing choices and offering priority housing preference for previous residents of Penn Plaza.  <br>Construction of the $13.6 million, 47 mixed-income, multi-family units that make up Mellons Orchard South began in 2019 and was completed in 2021. The development includes 35 apartment units, 12 townhouses and a community room. Of those, 37 units will be affordable, 10 will be market rate and eight are reserved for HACP project-based voucher holders. Fourteen former Penn Plaza residents are currently living there. The community also includes six accessible units and one unit for individuals with sensory impairments.  <br>The ground was broken today for the Harvard Beatty Housing new construction development, which will replace a surface parking lot at the edge of the East Liberty business district across from Mellons Orchard. This $14.3 million project will include 42 apartment units with 33 affordable units, nine market rate units, eight units for HACP project-based voucher holders and priority for former Penn Plaza residents. The project was awarded a 9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) by the state, which was part of Mayor William Peduto’s [record number of LIHTC awards in 2020](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4228). The project is expected to be completed and in service by late 2022.  <br>"It’s important to have partners work together to achieve the vision of our communities and to meet the needs they define like East Liberty did in their community plan,” said Mayor William Peduto. “These projects represent the brick and mortar affordable housing we need, but they also represent investment in our most important assets – our people, our businesses and their visions. I’d like to thank all of our partners who have made these projects a reality and especially thank ELDI and the Penn Plaza Support and Action Coalition for their most important contributions to its success.”  <br>“We are honored and proud to be a member of this team working to address important questions around urban redevelopment, affordability and the future of the East Liberty neighborhood,” said William Gatti, CEO and President of Trek Development Group. “The collaboration and generative spirit of this group of people is unique and heartwarming.” <br>Mellon's Orchard:<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16259_IMG_1850.JPG)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16258_IMG_1855.JPG)<br>Rendering of Harvard Beatty:<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16257_HBH1024_1[1].jpg)<br>_Images courtesy of_ _Perfido Weiskopf Wagstaff + Goettel._ | 28/10/2021 14:10:07 |

| City Shares Plans for Sustainable Public Safety Campus that Will Provide Life-Saving Services and Cost-Savings | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 29, 2021) Mayor William Peduto joined Department of Public Safety and Department of Public Works officials today at the site of the former Veterans Administration campus in Lincoln-Lemington to discuss the future of the site. The campus will be redeveloped and transformed into a state-of-the-art regional public safety training site, centralized campus for Pittsburgh Public Safety operations and will include net zero energy efficiency and stormwater management components to address the dangerous flood-prone Washington Boulevard corridor.  <br>The property was [acquired](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/5034) after federal government agencies approved the use of the site by the City as a public safety campus earlier this year. By relocating training facilities to one campus, Pittsburgh’s award-winning public safety bureaus intend to develop training for police, fire, EMS and animal care and control departments throughout the region to improve service to the greater community.  <br>The project will save millions of taxpayer dollars currently spent on leases by relocating public safety operations and public works storage from around the city to the campus.  The City plans to bring Emergency Medical Services headquarters from Shadyside, Police Headquarters from Chateau, Police Training Academy from Allegheny West and the vehicle repair shop from the Strip District. The plan also includes building an indoor firing range on the campus to move it from its current location in the Highland Park neighborhood. Locations that will be vacated that the City currently owns can be sold to be put back on the tax rolls and redeveloped to benefit neighborhoods. <br>The project will also allow the City to implement green and sustainable stormwater solutions to alleviate dangerous flooding along Washington Blvd for the safety of all. By vacating public safety facilities located on the low-lying road, the City and PWSA can create a comprehensive solution to divert stormwater from the road.  <br>The site will feature additional green sustainable solutions as redevelopment will follow the net zero requirements for City facilities championed by the Peduto Administration in 2019. The renovated buildings will be energy efficient and will produce as much energy as they consume, providing additional cost savings to taxpayers.  <br>“This site provides us with a historic opportunity to offer the best in life-saving training to public safety personnel from around the region, advance sustainable green development, provide a solution to decades of intractable flood mitigation challenges, expand the city tax base and save taxpayers money,” said Mayor Peduto. “This project thinks big and provides big solutions for the betterment of our communities.”  <br>Long-term financing plans for the campus are listed in the [City’s 2021 budget.](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12734_Capital_budget_as_approved_12-21-20.pdf)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16261_VA_SITE-1.png) | 29/10/2021 14:28:11 |
| Mayor Peduto Statement on Passing of Judge Justin Johnson | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 1, 2021) Mayor William Peduto has issued the following statement about the passing of the Honorable Justin Johnson:<br>"I had the privilege of getting to know Judge Justin Johnson through his leadership at East Liberty Presbyterian Church while I was a City Councilman. Together, we worked on issues of equity, peace and gun violence with his wife, Florence. I already knew him as a brilliant legal scholar and then got to experience his passion, heart and commitment for the City of Pittsburgh and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. <br>After his time on the bench, we maintained our friendship and I was honored when Judge Johnson swore me in as the 60th Mayor of Pittsburgh. My thoughts and prayers are with Florence and the whole Johnson family." | 1/11/2021 21:00:49 |
| City to Expand Nelson Mandela Peace Park in Garfield | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 1, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has finalized the purchase of an additional land parcel in the Garfield neighborhood to expand green space for the Nelson Mandela Peace Park. The community had requested the expansion of the park and has worked with the City and Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation to purchase the adjacent lot.  <br>The newly-purchased parcel sits between the park and a city-owned lot that will also be used to expand the green space. The City purchased the parcel from the Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation for $5,000 and will continue to work directly with the community to facilitate the expansion.  <br>The Department of Public Works has recently worked directly with the community to provide playground renovations inlcuding new equipment and a brand new spray feature, which was unveiled in August 2020.  <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16283_Mandela_Park_Parels.png)<br>_Aerial view of Nelson Mandela Peace Park with adjacent lots that will be used to expand the park._ | 1/11/2021 15:10:04 |
| City of Pittsburgh Announces Employee COVID-19 Vaccine Requirement to Protect Health and Safety of Employees and Public | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 1, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has announced that all employees are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by December 22, 2021 in order to protect employees as well as the public they serve.  <br>Employees will be considered fully vaccinated two weeks after a person’s second dose in a two-dose series and two weeks after a single-dose vaccine. The City will be hosting vaccine clinics for employees at city facilities to help accommodate getting the vaccinations.  <br>“We have all been through so much over the past year and a half as we watched COVID-19 shut down our businesses, our schools and sent people to shelter in place,” said Mayor William Peduto. “The science is clear that getting the vaccine protects us from the severity of COVID and its variants that are once again filling our hospitals. Our employees provide essential public services on the front lines, interacting directly with our critical communities like seniors, youth and those experiencing emergencies. It is our responsibility to act collectively to protect both our employees and the public so that we can move on and continue our recovery from the pandemic.” <br>A copy of Mayor Peduto's Executive Order for the vaccine requirement is available [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16278_VAX_EO_FIXED_(1).pdf). | 1/11/2021 11:56:15 |

| City, HACP and URA Host Tour on Renovations at 412 Boulevard of the Allies and One-Stop-Shop for Resident Needs | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 2, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh officials, Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) and Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) joined Mayor William Peduto today to present renovation progress on the new 412 Boulevard of the Allies building Downtown. The nine-story building was jointly purchased by the three co-owners in 2018 in order to relocate offices and services from the over-century-old John P. Robin Civic Building at 200 Ross Street into a new facility better equipped to serve the public and offer efficient services.  <br>The building is currently in various stages of renovation, with the URA’s renovations completed and operational. The building will also house HACP and the City’s Departments of City Planning (DCP), Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) and Permits, Licenses and Inspections (PLI) to make their services more accessible to the public. The entry level will serve as a user-friendly “One-Stop-Shop" for residents’ needs, complementing the City’s online [OneStopPGH](https://pittsburghpa.gov/onestoppgh/index.html) permit and licensing system, as well as HACP resident services. Individuals will be able to easily apply for any kind of permit or license at the “One-Stop-Shop" without having to navigate complicated processes involving visiting several different floors and offices, as was the case in 200 Ross Street.  <br>Upon purchase, the building had previously undergone renovations to the core, shell and mechanical systems. The current renovations will bring the building into Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) certification, offering cost savings through energy efficiencies. Each of the three owners are designing efficient, purpose-built spaces that are currently in various stages of design, maintenance and construction to fully build out a facility that meets to needs of employees and the public they serve.  <br>“We are glad to be here with all of our partners on this project to create a green, healthy working space for our staff and a more modernized, welcoming experience for our visitors,” said Mayor William Peduto. “I’d like to thank the URA and HACP for their partnership in this project, the Department of Public Works for their hard work in transforming the space and our Departments of City Planning, Permits, Licenses and Inspections and Mobility and Infrastructure for committing to delivering much easier walk-in services.”  <br>City of Pittsburgh offices will be housed on the second, third and fourth floors with HACP on floors five, six and seven and the URA already occupying the eighth and ninth floors.  <br>Renovation of 200 Ross Street, the previous home of the three entities, was cost prohibitive for the City. The building was over a hundred years old with chronically malfunctioning and antiquated heating and cooling systems, unreliable elevators and an unwelcoming floor plan for providing public services to visitors. The City is preparing to sell the iconic building, which was built as the administrative headquarters for Jones and Laughlin Steel, to save taxpayers money and encourage its redevelopment. | 2/11/2021 12:42:51 |
| Raised Crosswalk to be Installed on Darlington Road | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 2, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is pleased to announce the installation of traffic calming measures on Darlington Road from Wightman Street to Murray Avenue. A raised crosswalk will be installed at a high-use, mid-block crosswalk. Drivers were observed accelerating at an unsafe rate of speed near this mid-block crossing in order to make the traffic signal at Murray Avenue. The need to protect students crossing at this unprotected location indicated a strong need for a traffic calming intervention.<br>The project will include the construction of one raised crosswalk. A raised crosswalk works similarly to a speed hump by elevating the wheelbase of a vehicle in order to decrease its speed. The raised crosswalk has an ADA-compliant walkable surface for pedestrians to cross the road safely. Permanent signage and pavement markings will be installed to alert motorists of an approaching raised crosswalk.<br>Work is tentatively expected to begin on November 6, 2021 and is expected to last two days, weather permitting. Hours of construction will be Monday through Saturday 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Darlington Road will be closed to all traffic, except local, during construction of the raised crosswalk. Traffic will be detoured to Forbes Avenue or Bartlett Street. Local traffic may experience some short stoppages to safely pass through the work zone. Temporary no parking signage will be posted at the raised crosswalk location.<br>Thank you for your cooperation during this time. We hope there will be only minor inconveniences. If you have any questions or require further information regarding this project, you may contact the City’s Response Center by calling 311 or 412-255-2621.<br>If you have questions about any of our other traffic calming projects, you may contact us by email at trafficcalming@pittsburghpa.gov.

| City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership Seeking Community Input for Smithfield Street Visioning Survey | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16337_City_and_PDP.png)<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (November 4, 2021) – The City of Pittsburgh has partnered with the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership to launch a public survey to gather feedback on the future of the Smithfield Street corridor from community members who work, live, and play there.   <br>The Smithfield Street and Public Space Visioning Survey is part of Smithfield Reimagined, a community-based process to create a long-term vision and plan for the Smithfield Street corridor, which has served as an important destination in Downtown Pittsburgh for over 200 years. The project is one of nine high-impact priorities identified in the [Downtown Mobility Plan](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdowntownmobilityplan.org%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cmolly.onufer%40pittsburghpa.gov%7C41a766896a8d447bb75a08d99fb425cc%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C1%7C637716418362020623%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=gY9b8lTNhHnoEfr5epgDfYMOrczCEeFXWZhmc%2Bk%2Fp9g%3D&reserved=0), a unified mobility and placemaking plan for Downtown Pittsburgh’s streets released in May 2021.  <br>"Smithfield Street plays a vital role in the Downtown experience and is amid a reemergence, with hundreds of millions of private development dollars being invested along the corridor. This project will ensure that Smithfield Street will be a welcoming, walkable, and vibrant destination that celebrates its historic legacy, and where the Pittsburgh community can continue to ‘meet under the clock’ for decades to come,” said Mayor William Peduto.  <br>The survey results will be used to inform continued work along Smithfield Street and help guide future redevelopment in the area. The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is currently planning a $9 million reconstruction of the street between Forbes and Sixth Avenue to begin in 2023 and will use this long-term vision to inform specific design decisions.  <br>In the past year, the Department of City Planning and the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership have already gathered feedback on the project from community stakeholders such as Downtown residents, property owners, employers, small businesses, non-profits, community groups, and more.   <br>“We are grateful for the partnership both with the City of Pittsburgh and with stakeholders in the Downtown community” said Chris Watts, Vice President of District Development for the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. “This next round of feedback from the public will build upon what we’ve heard while directly guiding both upcoming short-term pilot projects and the long-term health and revitalization of one of the City’s most important corridors.”  <br>The Smithfield Street & Public Space Visioning Survey is now live and will be available through Sunday, December 5, 2021.

Through our partnership with regional leaders in the Marshall Plan for Middle America, we recognize that our economies in Upper Appalachia and the Ohio River Valley cannot depend on fossil fuels, but we already have the infrastructure in the companies, workforce and research and development to lead the future of sustainable energy rather than getting left behind.

While Upper Appalachia and the Ohio River Valley have historically depended on heavy industry and fossil fuels, the region has the resources to create the energy industry of the future through innovations and investments in the workforce, companies and infrastructure. Mayor Peduto is joined by several mayors in support of the MP4MA to create an equitable and just economy for their families and future generations.  <br>“The U.S. is proud to host the 2022 Clean Energy Ministerial and ministerial for Mission Innovation in the Steel City of Pittsburgh, PA, a town that exemplifies how a legacy energy and industrial-dependent economy can be transformed into a technology and innovation powerhouse,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “The joint CEM/MI ministerial meetings represent an opportunity to lock in climate commitments through big bets on innovation that empower an energy transition by 2050—averting the worst effects of climate change and supercharging economic opportunities for the global workforce.”<br>The United States hosting the 2022 CEM and MI reinforces its leadership and commitment to international collaboration. CEM and MI bring together 31 countries together with the goal of rapidly accelerating clean energy innovation and deployment to achieve net zero by 2050, to avoid the worst effects of climate change and provide new economic opportunities for workers at home and abroad.  <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16334_PGH_Announcement_CEM_v2.png) | 4/11/2021 14:29:37 |
| Walz Street to Be Converted to One-Way | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 5, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is pleased to announce that Walz Street between Rhine Street and Homer Street will be converted to a one-way street after review of safety issues observed by residents and DOMI staff. Our research found that street is narrow and sight is limited due to the horizontal curvature of the roadway, existing structures along the sidewalk and demand for on-street parking.<br>In order to address these vehicle and pedestrian safety concerns, one lane of traffic must be rerouted. DOMI has selected the southbound lane for removal based on community feedback and accessibility of adjacent streets. Walz Street will now be one-way in the northbound direction from Rhine Street to Homer Street.<br>Work will be done on Monday, November 15, 2021 between the hours of 7:00 am to 4:00 pm and is expected to last one day. Temporary signage will be placed before construction is scheduled to begin. DOMI will also place permanent signage for this new traffic operation.

| Mayor Peduto Signs Historic Bill to Create Hays Woods Park | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 5, 2021) Mayor William Peduto today signed the bill to officially create the Hays Woods Park. After nearly thirty years of Mayor Peduto’s steadfast advocacy for preserving the green space, Pittsburgh City Council recently passed the legislation allowing the City to buy the property from the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh for $1.   <br>“Hays Woods is a gem in the middle of the city,” said Mayor William Peduto. “My administration acquiring this land will ensure that generations of Pittsburghers are given the opportunity to enjoy the incredible wilderness it provides. It represents the capstone of some 30-years advocating for the protection of our environment and investing and expanding in our urban greenspaces and parks. The addition of Hays Woods Park not only protects our urban canopy, but it helps the City in its efforts to reach its Climate Action goals.”   <br>Hays Woods was originally a series of farms and coal mines that was previously privately owned. Throughout the past few decades, private entities have proposed developments, which Mayor Peduto vocally opposed as development of the natural land required severe deforestation and deconstruction of natural hills and ravines. As city councilman, Mayor Peduto voted against efforts to mountaintop the site and build a racetrack and casino. As Mayor, he opposed efforts to allow horizontal fracking at the site and negotiated the acquisition of the land.  <br>After years of environmental leadership and perseverance, Mayor Peduto worked to secure the property for public recreational use alongside Councilman Corey O’Connor and community groups. In 2016, the Urban Redevelopment Authority purchased the land for $5 million.  <br>While the land has a history of industrial use, the over 600 acres of Hays Woods has been naturally conserved and provides a sense of wilderness in an otherwise urban area. Despite the environmental degradation typical of old mined lands, it features areas of substantial tree canopy, significant flora and fauna, and even a pair of nesting bald eagles. A public parkland acquisition of this magnitude has not occurred in Pittsburgh since the formal establishment of Frick Park in 1927. Hays Woods is also the largest urban park and preservation project undertaken east of the Mississippi River in nearly 75 years.  <br>“So many have fought for this moment,” said Councilman Corey O’Connor who helped lead the effort to protect Hays Woods. “I want to thank the Mayor, community groups, foundations, and activists who have all worked to preserve this land. One of Pittsburgh’s greatest assets is our incredible greenspaces.”  <br>Mayor Peduto, Councilman O’Connor, and other City officials followed the bill signing with a ceremonial tree planting – the first new tree of Hays Woods. The City will now begin the process of planning future needs for Hays Woods such as parking and formalized access points. | 5/11/2021 14:28:01 |
| Paving Resumes Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 5, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is continuing its 2021 milling and paving program next week.     <br>Streets being milled include: Marland Way, Louisa St, Little St, Oakley Way, Marguerite and Stromberg. <br>Streets being paved include: West Ohio St, 20th St, Brandon Rd, Roosevelt Ave, Fall Way, Louisa St, Deely St, Marland Way, Martha St, Frampton Ave, Little St, Old Ln and Stromberg St.<br>Additional streets may be added next week. The full paving schedule for the week, including further details on streets and intersections, is available [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). Some milling and paving work next week will require night work, which is indicated on the online paving schedule.  <br>This year the City is investing well over $16 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout Pittsburgh. <br>Over 57 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>While many residents are continuing to work from home, the City will be continuing extra efforts to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for resurfacing will be posted weekly on [DOMI’s website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule) and will be publicized through city social media channels. | 5/11/2021 15:17:45 |

| Installation of Raised Crosswalk on Darlington Road Postponed to Next Week | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 5, 2021) The installation of a raised crosswalk for traffic calming on Darlington Road from Wightman Street to Murray Avenue that was expected this weekend will be postponed until next Saturday, November 13. <br>The installation of the raised crosswalk was [announced](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/5408) earlier this week. The traffic calming measure works similarly to a speech hump by elevating the wheelbase of a vehicle in order to decrease its speed while providing additional visibility for pedestrians on the ADA-compliant walkable surface. <br>The installation work is now expected to be begin on Saturday, November 13 and is expected to last two days, weather permitting. Hours of construction are Monday through Saturday 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Darlington Road will be closed to all traffic, except local, during construction. Traffic will be detoured to Forbes Avenue or Bartlett Street. Local traffic may experience some short stoppages to safely pass through the work zone. Temporary no parking signage will be posted at the raised crosswalk location.<br>For more information about DOMI's neighborhood traffic calming projects, please visit [www.pittsburghpa.gov/domi/traffic-calming](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/domi/traffic-calming). | 5/11/2021 10:28:47 |
| DOMI to Install Speed Humps on Bartlett Street | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 7, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) will begin working on the Squirrel Hill East-West Connector project on November 8, 2021, with pavement markings and construction of two (2) speed humps on Bartlett Street between Murdoch Street and Serpentine Drive and is expected to last up to two weeks, weather permitting. Intermittently, traffic will be detoured to avoid construction on this segment of Bartlett Street. The detour will be Hobart Street to Beacon Street to Murdoch Street.<br>Some of the project has been delayed until spring 2022. The signs put up in the corridor announcing construction is coming soon are no longer correct. Procurement issues and weather conflicts have caused this delay.<br>This project is part of DOMI’s Move Forward program, which aims to implement DOMI’s Bike+ Plan. The corridor will better connect Schenley Park, including the recently reopened Serpentine Drive, to Frick Park and the bike lanes on Beechwood Boulevard, while also connecting to existing bike lanes on Wightman Street. Traffic calming throughout the corridor and a contra-flow bike lane from Murdoch Street to Shady Avenue will create comfortable, bi-directional travel for cyclists while maintaining existing, legal parking spaces and all existing motor vehicle access.<br>Thank you for your cooperation during this time. We hope there will be only minor inconveniences. If you have any questions or require further information regarding this project, you may contact the City’s Response Center by calling 311 or 412-255-2621. If you have questions about this project or other DOMI Move Forward bike projects, you may contact us by email at moveforwardpgh@gmail.com.

| City Unveils Boulevard of the Allies Veterans Display Ahead of Roadway's 100th Anniversary | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 8, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall & Museum today unveiled a new display recognizing notable Pittsburgh veterans on the Boulevard of the Allies in Downtown Pittsburgh.

The display stretches down the Boulevard from Grant Street to Commonwealth Place and features the images of Pittsburgh veterans from the Civil War through the present day. The display has been unveiled in advance of the City’s Veterans Day Parade on November 11th and the iconic roadway's 100th Anniversary next year.

"Pittsburgh has an incredible history of service to the country," said Mayor Peduto. "There is no better place to recognize these veterans than on the iconic Boulevard of the Allies. The individuals featured span generations of American history and many individuals represent diverse groups who were pioneers for women and people of color in uniformed service."

The Boulevard of the Allies serves as a memorial to all those who participated in the successful termination of the First World War. It was formally dedicated on what was then still known as Armistice Day, November 11, 1922. In addition to the recognition of Pittsburgh veterans, the Department of Mobility & Infrastructure has illuminated the dedication pillars at Grant Street. The pillars were designed by renowned local sculptor Frank Vittor and feature the allegorical figures of victory, strength, and liberty. The ramp leading to the pillars features their dedicatory inscription and the flags of the Principal Allied Powers: the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Italy, Japan, and the United States of America.

“Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall & Museum is proud to collaborate with the City on this endeavor," said Tim Neft, Soldiers & Sailors Vice President & Director of Museum Education. "Our team has researched and selected 34 remarkable veterans from the Pittsburgh community. These individuals are all inductees in the Joseph A. Dugan, Jr. Hall of Valor at Soldiers & Sailors which honors veterans, living and deceased, for valor 'above and beyond the call of duty' while in action against the enemy. They truly represent the very best of our city.”

The Pittsburgh veterans selected from the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall & Museum’s Joseph A. Dugan, Jr. Hall of Valor who are featured on the Boulevard of the Allies are:

| A Statement from Mayor William Peduto on SB 448 and SB 565 | Mayor William Peduto today released the following statement on SB 448 and SB 565 currently under consideration by the Pennsylvania Senate:<br>“Pittsburgh knows all too well the dangers of gun violence. Instead of working to pass meaningful and popular common-sense reforms to address gun violence, the State Senate has voted to expand concealed carry and to punish municipalities and cities who act to keep their residents safe when those in Harrisburg refuse to. I want to thank Governor Wolf for vowing to veto both of these dangerous bills and standing up for the common-sense reform Pittsburghers and Pennsylvanians need and deserve.” | 10/11/2021 11:46:50 |
| City to Relocate DPW First Division from Riverview Park to River Avenue in Northside | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 10, 2021) The Office of Mayor Peduto has presented legislation to City Council to acquire property from the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) that will serve as the future home of the Department of Public Works (DPW) 1st Division.  <br>This is the first step in relocating the current 1st Division, which provides all DPW street operations on the North Side, from its current location in Riverview Park. This new facility will be net zero and follow the construction of the South Hills' new net-zero 4th Division building. <br>"This is a win-win. The hard working employees of Public Works need a new state of the art facility to support their work and this will allow us to cleanup the park and return this space to park users," said Mayor William Peduto <br>The City worked with the community, who called for the division to be moved from the popularly-used park.  <br>“Moving DPW First Division out of Riverview Park—our only regional park in the Northside—is a big win for everyone,” said City Councilman Bobby Wilson. “The eventual relocation of the First Division will move heavy machinery and temporary trash storage out of our beautiful park. DPW First Division does excellent work maintaining public infrastructure and providing services on the Northside, Downtown, and the Strip District. I’m excited for this first step of moving them into a new and modern facility on River Avenue. Thank you to Mayor William Peduto and the URA for helping me restore Riverview Park!” <br>“We are happy that the City is moving forward to relocate the Public Works depot from Riverview Park,” said Mark Masterson, Chair of Friends of Riverview Park. “This will strengthen the connection to the park for the Marshall-Shadeland neighborhood.  We want to thank Mayor Peduto and his staff for their work to improve Riverview Park." | 10/11/2021 11:29:02 |
| City of Pittsburgh Announces Second Voluntary Local Review of Sustainable Development Goals | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 10, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has released its second [Voluntary Local Review](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16393_PGH_2021_Procurement-Focused_VLR_(1).pdf) (VLR) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which the [City adopted](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3362) in 2019. The 2021 review builds off the information and recommendations from the initial review and focuses specifically on City Procurement, considering initiatives and contracts funded by or through the City. <br>VLRs provide a framework for the City to integrate SDGs into its work, keep a record of the City’s actions, measure progress and highlight opportunities for growth. The [first VLR](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4500), published in November 2020, laid the groundwork for Pittsburgh’s alignment with the SDGs by localizing the 17 universal goals to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and improve the quality of life for every human being. The review also provided an overview of the City’s sustainable initiatives and policies and recommended future steps.  <br>The 2021 VLR sets a framework for sustainable procurement: buy local, sustainable, ethical and circular. The projects listed may have received funding from the City’s Capital Budget, Operating Budget, federal/state/nonprofit grants or through public-private partnerships. It also analyzes four key areas of City spending: <br>- City Initiatives and Related Professional/Non-Professional Services <br>- Commodities, Equipment and Utilities Contracts <br>- American Rescue Plan Funds Allocations <br>- Financial Investment Strategies  <br>“The Voluntary Local Review process serves as a periodic report card on Pittsburgh’s progress towards collectively achieving these Sustainable Development Goals by 2030,” said Grant Ervin, Chief Resilience Officer. “We are partnering with nonprofits, universities and philanthropies to implement these goals and improve outcomes for all residents in the region.” <br>The City’s adoption of the SDGs and the development of the VLR is a cross-departmental partnership between the Department of City Planning, Office of Management & Budget, Mayor’s Office of Equity, Commission on Human Relations and Gender Equity Commission to incorporate SDGs into Procurement and Community Development. For example, in September 2020, the City of Pittsburgh adopted “Socially Responsible Investing” guidelines to ensure that pension investments in companies are divested from fossil fuels, for profit prisons, firearms and ammunition. <br>Adopting the SDGs and conducting the VLR demonstrates Pittsburgh’s leadership in thinking global and acting local. It connects our communities throughout the region by promoting equitable and resilient solutions for all while also plugging Pittsburgh into a global support network of cities looking to lead the way to a sustainable future.    <br>The City of Pittsburgh’s 2021 VLR can be viewed [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16393_PGH_2021_Procurement-Focused_VLR_(1).pdf) and last year's VLR is available [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12240_Pittsburgh_VLR_2020_Draft_FINAL.pdf). <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12282_SDGs.png) | 10/11/2021 14:38:49 |

| Pittsburgh and Glasgow Finalize Sister City Agreement at COP26 | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 11, 2021) The Cities of Pittsburgh and Glasgow finalized their exciting new partnership as sister cities in-person today, following a virtual signing ceremony last year. The meeting today between Mayor William Peduto and Leader of Glasgow City Council Susan Aitken formalizes a long-valued relationship between the two cities and is the next step in creating a strong connection between Pittsburgh and Glasgow. <br>Pittsburgh and Glasgow were both forged in an industrial past, situated on rivers, and are poised to lead the way on shared goals around environmental, racial justice, and economic and social equity agendas. The cities’ share leadership and goals in innovation, environmental sustainability, racial justice and economic and social equity in health, and wellbeing. <br>“The long-established Scottish connection to Pittsburgh has been strengthened in recent years as we’ve shared the challenges of industrial heritage, built a renewed strength through a shared resilience journey and now seek to collaborate further through a sister cities arrangement. We are working together to address issues of climate change, health inequality and building more equitable prosperity," Mayor William Peduto said. <br>This historic in-person signing comes while Glasgow is hosting the COP26, which Mayor Peduto and a Pittsburgh delegation are attending. The teams in Pittsburgh and Glasgow that have been working on this sister city relationship have been developing climate, innovation and sustainability goals together. <br>Leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken said: “Glasgow and Pittsburgh were titans of the industrial age – with global reputations for ships, built on the Clyde, and the mills that lined the rivers of the Steel City. Both endured very similar slumps in our fortunes as heavy industry faltered. Many thousands of jobs were lost; populations declined, and the health of citizens suffered. What is arguably more remarkable is the way our cities have fought back from these challenges over recent decades; with both drawing on their resilience to address the economic, social and physical legacies of our industrial past."<br>“We have already learned a lot from each other," Leader Aitken continued, "but this partnership will draw Glasgow and Pittsburgh closer together than ever before – and provides an opportunity for us to show real leadership on the climate emergency and building back from the Covid-19 pandemic in a way that prioritizes economic, social and environmental justice for all our people." <br>Pittsburgh currently has Sister Cities in 18 different countries. Cities with active engagement beyond Glasgow include Saitama City, Japan; Bilbao, Spain; Wuhan, China; and Da Nang, Vietnam. Glasgow has recently established partner and frontrunner city relationships with Santiago, Chile and Berlin, Germany. <br>“Now more than ever it is important for cities to have strong global partners. By partnering with cities like Glasgow, Pittsburgh can promote our innovation economy to the world and open up opportunities for our region. We are excited to work with the team in Glasgow and look forward to a long and prosperous relationship” said Grant Ervin, the City of Pittsburgh’s Chief Resilience Officer. <br>This new partnership came about with the assistance of the Sister Cities Association of Pittsburgh (SCAP). SCAP, like other like organizations across the US and world; seeks beneficial two-way partnerships with cities across the globe through economic, cultural and educational exchanges with cities that share commonalities, challenges and opportunities.  <br>**ABOUT SISTER CITIES ASSOCIATION OF PITTSBURGH**<br>Sister Cities Association of Pittsburgh connects the Pittsburgh region with international partner cities to develop mutually beneficial relationships in the area of commerce, education and culture; and to work together to address and solve global challenges facing cities of tomorrow. <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16408_IMG_9246.jpg) | 11/11/2021 11:38:08 |
| Peduto Administration Submits Electric Vehicle Readiness Ordinance to Support Electric Vehicle Charging to Reduce Emissions | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 11, 2021) As the market and demand for electric vehicles (EVs) grows, the Office of Mayor William Peduto and Department of City Planning Sustainability and Resilience Division are introducing an EV Readiness Ordinance to City Council next week as a commitment to meeting the current and anticipated demand for EVs throughout the City. This ordinance was developed with technical assistance from the Electrification Coalition through Pittsburgh’s participation in the American Cities Climate Challenge.  <br>The City is dedicated to addressing the threat of climate change and improving air quality by implementing more sustainable practices across Pittsburgh. The EV Charging Strategic Plan for Pittsburgh Public Facilities, which was developed in 2020, aims to increase the total number of new public charging plugs to more than 200 on City property and more than 2,000 total across the city by 2025. The City is also working towards the goal of operating a fossil-fuel-free fleet by 2030.  <br>In 2019, an Intradepartmental EV Task Force was formed to manage fleet and public charging infrastructure projects, plan for public charging and find supplemental funding. The task force includes designated staff from the Sustainability and Resilience Division, Office of Management and Budget, Fleet Services, Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh (PPA), Department of Permits Licensing and Inspections and the Department of Public Works.   <br>Since 2016, the City has received more than $1.1 million in grant funding, which has supplemented the conversion of the City fleet to electric, with a new publicly accessible DC fast charging project in East Liberty in the planning stages. The City currently operates the largest EV fleet in Western PA with 26 EVs and plans to incorporate 36 more. In 2022, the City will begin to convert pickups, vans and refuse trucks to electric. <br>"Our region is emerging as a leader in clean energy and sustainability and as we work towards our climate action goals, we need to ready our City facilities to provide our fleet as well as the public with opportunities to charge electric vehicles," said Mayor Peduto. "Providing electric vehicle charging stations at city facilities, and with partners citywide, will allow our residents to join us in improving our air quality and reducing emissions." <br>With the EV Readiness Ordinance, new and renovated City-owned facilities will now have electrical capacity and equipment installed simultaneously with construction to develop the necessary infrastructure to support both the City fleet's EVs and encourage public charging on City property. Laying the infrastructure at the time of construction creates efficiency and significantly reduces costs overall. The EV Task Force will decide on the installation of level 2 and DC Fast Charging stations to meet the City’s needs and ensure that all upgrades to City facilities incorporate make-ready infrastructure to accommodate EV chargers.  <br>**About the Electrification Coalition**<br>The Electrification Coalition is a national non-profit focused on scaling and implementing a broad set of strategies to drive widespread adoption of electric vehicles. These strategies include policy development, advocacy campaigns, consumer education, fleet electrification, cultivation of bipartisan support, community electrification planning, EV supply chain development, and coalition building. | 11/11/2021 14:11:16 |
| Peduto Administration Submits Two Sustainable Procurement Laws | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 12, 2021) The Peduto Administration has introduced two ordinances to City Council to help Pittsburgh transition to sustainable consumption and production through innovative procurement practices. The first ordinance will mandate the use of electronic signatures across City departments and the second addresses sustainable and socially responsible procurement. <br>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Pittsburgh, like workplaces around the world, shifted to policies that ensured continued productivity including the shift to electronic signatures, which helped to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and decrease the likelihood of documents being lost in transit while awaiting signatures. Through two years utilizing DocuSign and electronic signatures, the City has saved approximately: 35,862 lbs. of wood (approximately 108 trees), 105,591 gallons of water (approximately 75 washing machines), 84,174 lbs. of Carbon (approximately 9 cars), and 5,826 lbs. of waste (approximately 96 trash cans). These savings have encouraged a permanent shift to electronic signatures through this ordinance.  <br>As the second city in the United States to join the Global Lead City Network on Sustainable Procurement, the City of Pittsburgh is committed to using its purchasing power to address climate change and advance equity. The Sustainable and Socially Responsible Procurement ordinances will codify the City’s procurement practices, ensuring that tax dollars are used to support environmentally and socially responsible vendors. Other changes include: <br>- A new definition for sustainable procurement  <br>- Definitions for environmentally preferable and socially responsible product <br>- Factors for reviewing proposals such as transportation distance and product repurposing <br>- Requirement of a Sustainability, Diversity, and Inclusion profile for some vendors in RFPs and ITQs <br>- Updates to the code related to paper products, electronics, lighting, furniture, and office supplies to match modern environmental standards <br>This work is inspired by the Global Lead City Network on Sustainable Procurement (GLCN), a group of 15 cities around the world committed to implementing innovative procurement practices to drive the transition to sustainable consumption and production. <br>“Our Procurement division has worked to create more equitable and accessible processes for procurement over the past few years and we are pleased to introduce additional sustainability standards so that we are responsibly investing taxpayer money in vendors, companies and products that support our climate action goals,” said Mayor William Peduto.  <br>Links to each ordinance can be found [here](https://pittsburgh.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5208645&GUID=519F3FE4-0264-48D1-B9DD-6FCD110044BB&Options=ID|Text|&Search=docusign) and [here](https://pittsburgh.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5208646&GUID=16223F5A-65C2-46BA-94D4-CDED02FA8C02&Options=ID|Text|&Search=2149). | 12/11/2021 15:24:06 |
| City Announces Traffic Restrictions for Delivery and Installation of 106th Christmas Tree and Holiday Festivities at the City-County Building | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 12, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Works advises that one lane of Grant Street will be closed between Fourth and Forbes Avenues, from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. Saturday, November 13th and Sunday, November 14th, to allow the Forestry Division to transport and install the 106th City of Pittsburgh Christmas Tree at the City-County Building.   <br>Drivers can expect temporary lane and road closures beginning at 8:00 A.M. on Ollie Street in the Lincoln Place neighborhood. There may also be delays along Mifflin Road, the Glenwood Bridge, Irvine Street, and Second Avenue as the tree is escorted Downtown. <br>**About Pittsburgh’s 106th Christmas Tree**<br>The 106th City of Pittsburgh Christmas Tree has been donated by the Fuga Family from the Lincoln Place neighborhood. While Lincoln Place has been home to the tree for decades, the tree is actually returning to Downtown Pittsburgh.  <br>In the 1990's, the blue spruce was one of two small decorative trees that sat outside of the Pennsylvanian at Grant Street and Liberty Avenue. Mr. Chris Fuga, a former employee of the Pennsylvanian, took the two pine trees home following the holiday season. He planted both trees in his front yard, but only one survived and flourished. The Fuga family started a tradition to decorate the tree every holiday season, until it became too big to continue decorating. Now over twenty years later, the tree is returning to Downtown Pittsburgh.   <br>“It was like our tree was practicing for all of its life for this moment,” said Mr. Fuga.  <br>The tree will serve as Pittsburgh’s official Christmas tree through the New Year. The erection of a Christmas tree at the City-County Building remains one of Downtown’s oldest traditions. The first tree was erected on the construction site of the City-County Building in 1914.  <br>“It’s bittersweet to see the tree Downtown. It represents so many great childhood memories for our family, but I’m glad it will bring joy to so many others this holiday season,” said Carly Fuga, Mr. Fuga’s youngest daughter.  <br>**Annual Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony and Holiday Festivities at the City-County Building**<br>The annual City of Pittsburgh Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony and City-County Building light show will take place on a new date and at a new time this year during the return of the Downtown Pittsburgh Partnership's Highmark Light Up Night celebrations.  <br>The ceremonies will take place on Grant Street in front of the City-County Building beginning at 4 P.M. on Saturday, November 20th, and feature River City Brass, Texture Contemporary Ballet, Pittsburgh CLO Holiday Melody, and Pitches and Tones. The 106th Christmas Tree will be lit at 5 PM and feature rooftop fireworks for the first time. The musically timed City-County Building Holiday Lightshow will also perform at 5:20, 6:45, and 8:00 PM.

| URA and Historic Deutschtown Development Corporation Select Two Partners for Redevelopment in East Ohio Street Business District | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 12, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh and Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) have partnered with the Historic Deutschtown Development Corporation (HDDC) on the redevelopment of three contiguous properties in the East Allegheny neighborhood and East Ohio Street business district.  <br>Two of the properties, 624 and 628 E Ohio Street, are currently owned by the URA and 620 E Ohio Street is currently owned by the HDDC. Teams from both the URA and the community-based organization reviewed proposals for redevelopment of the properties and have selected R. Kyndall and Fulani Development Group.  <br>"This redevelopment project will bring new opportunities for retail and office space to the E Ohio Street business corridor, in line with the community's vision for their neighborhood business district," said Mayor William Peduto. "I'd like to thank the community, HDDC, URA, R. Kyndall and Fulani Development Group for their partnership on this project." <br>The $4.9 million proposed redevelopment of the 13,240 square foot combined parcel will include retail space on the first floor and add a second and third story for commercial office space with ADA accessibility. The spaces will be constructed as “vanilla shell,” meaning the walls, flooring, ceilings, lighting and plumbing will be finished to save cost on tenant buildouts.  <br>"I'm excited for the redevelopment of these vacant properties on East Ohio Street,” said City Councilman Bobby Wilson. “This is a substantial investment in one of the great Main Streets in the City of Pittsburgh. Though the construction of I-279 nearly broke the spine of this historic Northside business district, investments like this will help us continue to revitalize East Ohio Street. I am looking forward to working with the community to attract stable and successful retail and commercial tenants at these properties."  <br>The partnership with R. Kyndall and Fulani Development group will be presented to the URA Board at their meeting next Tuesday. Both redevelopment partners will continue to work with community stakeholders to attract retail and professional jobs to the East Ohio business district.  <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16409_image_(1).png)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16410_image_(2).png)<br>Potential renderings of the redevelopment project. | 12/11/2021 14:10:48 |
| Paving Resumes Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 12, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is continuing its 2021 paving program next week.     <br>There will be no milling next week, but streets being paved include: Deely St, Marland Way, Little St, Frampton Ave, Garrison Pl, 20th St, Martha St, Old Ln, Kensington St, Gettysburg St, Filmore St and Fall Way. <br>The full paving schedule for the week, including further details on streets and intersections, is available [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). <br>This year the City is investing well over $16 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout Pittsburgh. <br>Over 57 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year.

| Pittsburgh Creates Energy Strategy to Address Climate Action in City Development Reviews | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 13, 2021) As the Office of Mayor William Peduto closes out a week of environmental initiatives and Mayor Peduto’s attendance at COP26, the Department of City Planning’s Sustainability and Resilience Division has finalized the [City Energy Strategy](https://hdp-us-prod-app-pgh-engage-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9616/2560/3205/City_of_Pittsburgh_Energy_Strategy.pdf), Pittsburgh’s first municipal energy plan. The strategy was developed to integrate the short- and long-term actions in the [Climate Action Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/climate-action-plan) into the City’s development review processes to help reach the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030. <br>Over the next four years, the City Energy Strategy will integrate energy plans into planning and development review to evaluate energy systems decisions early in the planning process and improve long-term coordination between utilities, permit holders and developers. Planning for clean and renewable energy in developments leads to fewer emissions, more efficient buildings, healthier spaces for building occupants and annual cost-savings for building owners.  <br>“We must act collectively and quickly to develop a sustainable city in order to support healthy and equitable communities, create jobs and produce opportunities for clean, renewable energy to help meet our climate action goals,” said Mayor William Peduto. “The City Energy Strategy allows us to work together to integrate climate efficiencies and build a city that is livable and sustainable for all.”  <br>Among other things, the strategy recommends using climate mitigation incentives throughout the development process, such as expanding the Zoning Code’s performance points system citywide. This system is currently in place for the [EcoInnovation District](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/eid) and [riverfront development](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/prz) and allows developers to earn points and benefits by meeting specified goals such as energy efficiency, generating electricity with on-site renewable energies, connecting to district energy, stormwater management and/or transit-oriented development in their planning. This approach allows developers to define and work towards their own goals while also contributing to the City’s overall emissions reduction goals. Some of the other tools identified in the strategy include transparent utility consumption data, coordinated assets, and management structures such as a climate and energy committee. <br>The City Energy Strategy focuses on increasing energy efficiency in the built environment, infrastructure, efficient city and governance.

| Media Advisory: Mayor Peduto Joins UnitedOnGuns and Everytown for Gun Safety Mayors Against Illegal Guns to Launch Mass Shooting Protocol and Playbook | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 18, 2021) Mayor William Peduto will be speaking at the Everytown for Gun Safety Mayors Against Illegal Guns University (MAIGU) today for the launch of the Mass Shooting Protocol and Playbook. A year after the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill, Mayor Peduto was a leader in proposing the need for mayors and city managers to have a resource, protocol, checklist and playbook to respond to mass shootings.  <br>The City of Pittsburgh worked with UnitedOnGuns, an initiative of the Public Health Advocacy Institute at Northeastern University School of Law, and mayors and first responders from cities that have shared the trauma of mass shoots, including Dayton, Ohio, El Paso, TX, Orlando, FL, Parkland, FL and San Bernadino, CA.  <br>Through partnership and collaboration with these cities, two protocol documents have been produced to assist local leaders in responding to mass shootings. The first is the First 24 Hours Mass Shooting Protocol, which guides mayors through rapid response and provides a checklist for immediate actions. The Mass Shooting Protocol is available [here](https://secureservercdn.net/72.167.242.48/o06.475.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mass-Shooting-Protocol.pdf).  <br>The second document produced is the Mass Shooting Playbook, which provides over 200 pages of guidance that mayors can use to prepare for, respond to and help survivors, families and communities recover from a mass shooting. A copy of the Mass Shooting Playbook is available [here](https://unitedonguns.org/protocol/).  <br>Today, Mayor Peduto will join Orlando Chief of Staff Heather Fagan, Director of the Office of the Dayton City Commission Torey Hollingsworth, ICPTTA Project Director Tara Hughes, and Protocol co-author Sarah C. Peck for a MAIG University on November 18 at 2pm to 3:30pm EDT. The expert panel will discuss the role of a mayor’s office following a mass shooting, best practices based on their experience, and the importance of scheduling a tabletop exercise.  <br>Registration for the event can be found [here](https://mayors.everytown.org/mayors-against-illegal-guns-university/).  <br>Everytown for Gun Safety requests that any media submit any direct quotes of speakers to them before publication.  <br>Everytown for Gun Safety Media Contact:  <br>Adam Sege <br>ASege@everytown.org | 18/11/2021 09:53:48 |

| City of Pittsburgh Receives Highest Score Ever on Human Rights Campaign Equality Index | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 18, 2021) The Office of Mayor William Peduto has proudly announced today that for the fifth year in a row, the City of Pittsburgh has scored 100/100 on the Human Rights Campaign’s [Municipal Equality Index Scorecard](https://www.hrc.org/resources/municipal-equality-index) (MEI), earning an additional 15 flex points, the City’s highest to date.  <br>The 2020 MEI scored 506 U.S cities of varying sizes on criteria that examine how inclusive municipal laws, policies and services are for LGBTQ+ people who live and work there. Cities are rated based on non-discrimination laws, the municipality as an employer, municipal services, law enforcement and the city leadership’s public and policy positions on equality.  <br>A few examples of areas MEI scored cities on include the offering of transgender-inclusive healthcare benefits, non-discrimination laws in employment, housing and public accommodations, an LGBTQ+ police liaison, an LGBTQ+ liaison in the Mayor’s Office and non-discrimination for City employment and contractors. While the final score cannot exceed 100, the City of Pittsburgh received 15 additional flex bonus points for additional equality measures such as: <br>- Laws protecting youth from conversion therapy <br>- City employee domestic partner benefits <br>- Youth bullying prevention policy for city services  <br>- City services for LGBTQ+ youth <br>- City services for LGBTQ+ older adults <br>- City services provided to people living with HIV or AIDS <br>- City services for the transgender community <br>- Openly LGBTQ+ city elected or appointed leaders <br>“We are proud to receive the maximum 100 points for the fifth year in a row from the Human Rights Campaign,” said Mayor Peduto. “We have received a record number of flex points for Pittsburgh thanks to the hard work of our Office of Equity, elected officials and departments in working towards a welcoming, more inclusive city for all.”  <br>The City of Pittsburgh’s full 2021 MEI scorecard can be found [here](https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/MEI-2021-Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania.pdf). | 18/11/2021 14:56:50 |
| City Seeking Company to Manage Electronic and Household Hazardous Waste Recycling Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 19, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works Environmental Services have released a request for proposals (RFP) to find a company to continue a program for residents to recycle and properly dispose of electronic waste and household hazardous waste, including televisions, computers, batteries and pesticides.  <br>For the program, the City will provide the facility and utilities at 3001 Railroad Street in the Strip District and will require e-waste and household hazardous waste to be recycled in full compliance with state and federal laws, an e-steward or R2 certification. <br>The City is committed to providing accessible options for Pittsburgh residents to safely and responsibly dispose of electronic and household hazardous waste to prevent fires and the pollution of our rivers, vacant lots, alleys and hillsides with lead, mercury, and other poisons. <br>Since summer 2019, 386 tons have been properly disposed and recycled through this program, including 270 tons of electronic waste and 116 tons of household hazardous waste and universal wastes.<br>The full list of items the City is asking quotes for as well as the full RFP is available [here](https://secure.procurenow.com/portal/pittsburghpa/projects/13673) on the City’s web-based procurement site Beacon.

| Finance Director to Leave Role with City Government | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 19, 2021) The Office of Mayor William Peduto has announced that Department of Finance Director and City Treasurer Douglas Anderson is leaving his role with the City. <br>Anderson started working for the City in January 2008, as the Deputy Controller and Chief of Staff to City Controller Michael Lamb. Mayor Peduto [appointed](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4212) him Director of Finance and City Treasurer in September 2020. <br>Under Anderson’s leadership, the City’s Department of Finance navigated new financial challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic while also undertaking modernization improvements to update outdated systems and processes in the department to benefit its hardworking employees and the public. Among his many accomplishments throughout his career with the City, Anderson led efforts to: <br>- Streamline and improve the process for the purchase of City property to reduce the amount of time it takes to finalize purchases <br>- Create a framework to improve land care and maintenance of City-owned properties to invest in local land care businesses and remediate blighted properties more efficiently <br>- Transition seven disparate tax collection systems into one online system to improve efficiency of tax collection for employees as well as provide a user-friendly portal for taxpayers that includes online check payments <br>“Doug took on the role of Finance Director in one of the most uncertain times in recent financial memory and brought a sense of modern leadership to the department,” said Mayor William Peduto. “I thank him for responding to the needs of the community and the needs of his staff by recognizing that we don't have to continue to do things the way they’ve always been done but can create new opportunities for efficiency and transparency.” <br>During his time in the City Controller’s office, Anderson oversaw the implementation of several government transparency initiatives, including the creation of [Open Book Pittsburgh](https://pittsburghpa.gov/controller/index.html), a website and searchable database of City of Pittsburgh contracts, campaign finance contributions to candidates running for office in the City of Pittsburgh and lobbyists that do business with the City. He also oversaw the annual preparation of the [Popular Annual Financial Report](https://pittsburghpa.gov/controller/pafr) and managed many other roles, including assigning audit work to performance and fiscal audit staff and approving all Controller’s office expenditures. <br>Anderson’s last day with the City of Pittsburgh is today. He will be joining PNC Bank as Relationship Manager and Vice President. | 19/11/2021 11:31:13 |
| Mayor Peduto Welcomes Altruism in Medicine Institute's World Headquarters in Pittsburgh | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 19, 2021) Today, Mayor William Peduto was joined by Dr. Barry Kerzin to announce the opening of the [Altruism in Medicine Institute (AIMI)](https://altruismmedicine.org/) in Pittsburgh. The Northside-based institute works with local communities and institutions to teach applying Eastern philosophy to Western medical practices to create basic human-based compassionate care that benefits both the patients and medical practitioners.  <br>The AIMI was founded by Dr. Kerzin, who is a California-born family physician who moved to India in 1988 to provide free medical care to local communities. There, he began studying Buddhism and meditation and was ordained a Bikkshu (Buddhist monk) by the Dalai Lama in February of 2003. He has since served as the Dali Lama’s personal physician as well as lecturer and teacher worldwide.  <br>Dr. Kerzin started AIMI to teach medical principles that revive basic human caring in medical practice. It is common for medical professionals to feel burnout, depression, anger and frustration, which has been exacerbated by the high physical and emotional demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. The AIMI works with medical professionals to teach that empathy can lead to burnout, but self-compassion, compassion for others and mindfulness will result in resilience that improves outcomes for nurses, physicians, physicians assistants and other health care professionals as well as for patients.  <br>While the AIMI has worked with health care professionals around the world, they intend to continue working with Pittsburgh’s large medical community, many of whom can take the teachings to other parts of the world. To date, they have worked with over 4,000 nurses and physicians at one Pittsburgh health care organization, medical students and are engaged with other medical and education institutions.  <br>In partnership with the City of Pittsburgh, AIMI has expanded their teachings to include additional professions that regularly engage and provide service to people, particularly vulnerable people in need. Recognizing the need to avoid burnout, AIMI has worked with first responders, Citiparks staff and the Office of Community Health and Safety team to provide trainings in altruism, meditation and compassion to take care of themselves and, in turn, continue to provide high quality service to the people of Pittsburgh.  <br>“I’d like to thank Dr. Barry Kerzin for choosing Pittsburgh to set up the AIMI which will teach our local communities and communities all around the world compassion to avoid burnout in demanding, public-facing fields where self-care and altruism are critical for staff and the people they serve. We have started an important partnership to provide this for our own staff and we thank AIMI for working with us to work towards creating a Pittsburgh that is compassionate and altruistic for all.” | 19/11/2021 13:33:00 |

| Pittsburgh EMS Becomes Third in the Country to Provide Lifesaving Prehospital Buprenorphine for Opioid Overdoses | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 22, 2021) The Office of Community Health and Safety has announced that a pilot group of Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services (EMS) paramedics have completed training to administer prehospital buprenorphine and began implementing the practice over the weekend. In September, the Pennsylvania Department of Health Bureau of EMS approved the City of Pittsburgh EMS’ Prehospital Buprenorphine Pilot Program, making Pittsburgh the third city in the country to implement this lifesaving intervention.  <br>While all City of Pittsburgh Public Safety Bureau personnel are trained to administer naloxone (Narcan) in order to effectively provide life-saving rescue therapy to individuals experiencing overdoses, buprenorphine is regularly used by hospitals and physicians to treat opioid use disorder and opioid withdrawal, which is often experienced after naloxone is administered.<br>As part of the pilot, Advanced Life Support EMS units will be able to administer buprenorphine to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal regardless if that patient decides to go to the hospital. Patients will then be able to schedule a virtual follow up with the UPMC Medical Toxicology Bridge Clinic to have a consultation with a doctor within 24 hours to get a buprenorphine prescription and be connected to other critical harm reduction resources.<br>“The opioid epidemic has deeply affected so many cities and communities. If tools like buprenorphine exist, we need to have them in our communities and with our emergency medical personnel,” said Mayor William Peduto. “I’d like to thank the Department of Public Safety, Pittsburgh EMS and the Office of Community Health and Safety for their continued leadership here in our communities and nationally to provide real solutions to those with sustance use disorder.”<br>“Pittsburgh EMS has continually led the way, operating on the cutting edge of prehospital medical advancements,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich.  “We want to continue to support our community members through field-based implementation of medical practices to save lives.” <br>The pilot program was designed by the [Bureau of EMS](https://pittsburghpa.gov/ems/index.html) in partnership with the [Office of Community Health and Safety](https://pittsburghpa.gov/ochs/) and will run for one year.  <br>As part of the expansion of public health-informed overdose prevention initiatives, the City of Pittsburgh will also begin distribution of fentanyl test strips, following Mayor Peduto's [executive order in August](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/5227) allowing for the possession and use of these prevention tools. This has been made possible by funding from the Staunton Farm Foundation and their public health leadership. | 22/11/2021 11:45:24 |
| Partial Closure of Fifth and Forbes Avenues | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 23, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is announcing the temporary paving of Fifth Avenue and Forbes Avenue in the Uptown neighborhood.<br>Milling and repaving of Fifth Avenue and Forbes Avenue between Sixth Street and Moultrie Street will start on Tuesday, November 30, 2021 for approximately one week and construction will take place between 5:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. During this time, traffic may be reduced to a single lane. Performing this work is contractor A. Folino Construction, Inc.<br>Currently, several utility company construction projects have been actively replacing underground utilities beneath Fifth Avenue and Forbes Avenue. The temporary paving is to stabilize the road surface for travel during the winter months before utility work begins again in the spring of 2022.<br>Thank you for your cooperation during this time.

| City Receives $963,000 Grant for South 21st Street Complete Green Street Project | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 23, 2021) The City of Pittsburgh has been [awarded a $963,578 grant](https://dced.pa.gov/newsroom/wolf-administration-provides-more-than-84-million-for-infrastructure-improvements-across-pennsylvania/) from the state’s [Commonwealth Financing Authority’s Multimodal Transportation Fund](https://dced.pa.gov/programs/multimodal-transportation-fund/) for the South 21st Street Complete Green Street Project in the South Side. The community-driven project would transform South 21st Street into a green boulevard and gateway from the East Carson business district corridor to South Side Park to divert stormwater and improve pedestrian safety.  <br>The proposed South 21st Street Complete Green Street Project will incorporate a complete streets approach, a policy introduced by Mayor William Peduto in a [2015 executive order](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/1090) requiring that all new city street design projects make it safer for all users to travel like pedestrians, bicyclists, public transit vehicles, private vehicles and more. The proposal also includes natural and green infrastructure features to address stormwater runoff, erosion and issues of combined sewers.  <br>The design would allow for traffic calming, pedestrian safety and green infrastructure by installing pervious pavers and pervious parking that will absorb stormwater rather than allowing it to sit atop of pavement to flood. It also includes bioswale islands in the middle of the street, as well as natural trees and grasses throughout, to capture stormwater. The larger project also calls for stormwater storage within South Side Park to reduce strain on the combined sewer system.  <br>The project has been developed in partnership with the South Side community, City of Pittsburgh, ALCOSAN, Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority and Western Pennsylvania Conservancy | 23/11/2021 12:22:32 |
| Mayor Peduto Commends PWSA and PUC for Reaching Rate Settlement to Create Stormwater Management Fee and Eliminate Tap-In Feeds to Help Small Businesses and Affordable Housing Development | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 24, 2021) Following [an announcement](https://www.pgh2o.com/news-events/news/press-release/2021-11-18-pwsa-announces-approval-new-rate-structure-including) last week from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), Mayor William Peduto is commending the PWSA and Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) for the approval of a rate settlement to create additional funding to serve City residents with safe and reliable water, sewer and stormwater services.  <br>The new rate plan includes funding for critical community investments, enhancing the customer assistance programs, adjusted development fees and a financial incentive for consumers to enroll in auto-pay.  <br>Part of the rate settlement includes eliminating tap-in fees, which are fees for residential homes and new developments to connect to water and sewer services. In [a letter](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15690_Mayor_Letter_Tap-in_Fees_PUC.pdf) advocating for the removal of these fees in order to remove barriers to opening a business or developing affordable housing, Mayor Peduto wrote to PUC Secretary Rosemary Chiavetta: <br>“These expensive fees disproportionately hurt small and independent businesses and inhibit our ability to develop much-needed affordable housing units, especially as we work to restore our economy from the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic. <br>Eliminating tap-in fees would go a long way toward rebuilding our neighborhoods, recovering from the devastating impact of the pandemic, and making it easier for our residents to open a business.... <br>The pandemic has further magnified the inequity in our society, and it is more imperative than ever that we simplify the process to develop affordable housing units. These tap-in fees add to the already growing cost of developing housing that is accessible and affordable for the residents of our communities. Abolishing this fee would enable the City of Pittsburgh to advance our goal of ensuring that all of Pittsburgh’s residents can remain in their neighborhoods and improving quality of life for all.” <br>A portion of the rate settlement addresses development fees for water and sewer connections to public infrastructure. A PWSA fee study completed this year recommended new permit and operations fees based on hours worked and equipment needed to provide connection services. Many costs will be reduced. The new fees will go into effect at the same time as the new monthly rates on January 12, 2022.  <br>Mayor Peduto also supports the critical stormwater fee outlined in the settlement that will fund investment in sustainable solutions for stormwater management in response to the impacts of climate change the city has so clearly been experiencing. Increasingly frequent and intense rains cause combined sewer system to overflow into rivers and streams, flood streets and cause property damage and health concerns when basements back up. All properties across the board will be assessed so that all residents and businesses are supporting these important investments, not just PWSA water customers.  <br>PWSA and the City are working with the [Water Center at Penn and PennPraxis](https://www.pgh2o.com/news-events/news/press-release/2021-04-07-pwsa-awards-contract-establish-stormwater-master-plan) to create a new comprehensive stormwater management strategy that addresses the current circumstances to meet the needs of residents, PWSA and the City.

| City Joins Big Tom's Groundbreaking, Bringing $1.94 Million of Investments for Barbershop, Affordable Housing and Community Revitalization Project on Hill District's Centre Avenue Business Corridor | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 30, 2021) Mayor William Peduto joined Thomas Boyd, Sr. of TomTom24 Development, LLC as well as the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA), Neighborhood Allies and other elected official, stakeholder and community partners to break ground on a revitalization project at 2178 Centre Avenue in the Hill District. The project will transform the former historic Hamm’s Barber Shop into the new home of Mr. Boyd’s Big Tom’s Barbershop while also creating affordable housing units and community space along the Hill District’s Centre Avenue business district.  <br>Mr. Boyd will relocate his business to the first floor of the rehabilitated structure. The second and third floors will be rehabbed into four one-bedroom apartments affordable to households at or below 80% Area Median Income (AMI). The adjacent lots will be beautified and used as open space for the community and for pop-up sales and product demonstrations from local home-based businesses.  <br>"Today is truly a celebration as we recognize the work of my friend and community champion Thomas Boyd. Big Tom’s is a staple in the Hill District community and it’s momentous that he will be redeveloping the historic Hamm’s to be the new home of his barbershop and using the opportunity to meet the community’s need for housing and shared space for community entrepreneurs,” said Mayor Peduto. “I’d like to thank him, as well as the funding partners who have joined us in supporting this redevelopment. This significant investment in the historic Hill District business district will be one of many we will see as part of the Hill community plans and the Avenues of Hope initiative.” <br>The new Big Tom’s Barbershop project arose from a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) the URA released in July 2019 seeking multiple developers to purchase and redevelop any portion of 170 publicly-owned parcels along the Centre Avenue corridor in the Middle Hill neighborhood. The goal of the RFQ was to select developers to bring uses and concepts identified as priorities by the community in the 2015 Centre Avenue Corridor Redevelopment and Design Plan and the 2011 Greater Hill District Master Plan.    <br>Mr. Boyd presented his proposal at a community meeting hosted by City Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle in September 2020 and received a community approval score of 100%.  <br>“We couldn’t be more excited for Big Tom and this project which will break new ground in the Hill District,” said URA Deputy Executive Director Dr. Diamonte Walker. “The success of this project will not only signal catalytic change along the Centre Avenue corridor, but also paves the way for future commercial revitalization projects which simultaneously creates opportunities for community-centered ownership while closing the City of Pittsburgh's affordable housing gap.”   <br>“We are honored to be an ally and partner on this journey with Big Tom and to support him in accessing the tools and resources needed to create transformative community change in the Hill District,” said Neighborhood Allies President, Presley Gillespie. "This project is the true epitome of equitable community development-encompassing the redevelopment of a physical place and creating opportunity for the people who call that place home. We're incredibly proud to that Mr. Boyd is not only poised to own a key corner parcel in his neighborhood, but also grow his community serving business over the coming years." <br>To date the project has received over $1.94 million in funding from First National Bank (the largest subsidiary of F.N.B. Corporation), Lower Hill Group, Neighborhood Allies, Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency and URA. The project has also received over 450 of intensive technical assistance from Neighborhood Allies through their Centralized Real Estate Accelerator. <br>"Thanks to all the people who have been working hard - all the community groups, all the funders, Neighborhood Allies, URA and all the people who have been helping me through this process," said Mr. Boyd. "I just feel blessed and we're going to continue giving back to the neighborhood." | 30/11/2021 13:42:08 |

| A Statement From Mayor William Peduto On Departure Of Grant Oliphant From Heinz Endowments | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 1, 2021) Mayor William Peduto today released the following on Mr. Grant Oliphant's announcement that he is departing the Heinz Endowments for new opportunities:<br>"Grant Oliphant has been a true leader of the rebirth of Pittsburgh. Over the past 30 years he has been an advocate of equity, sustainable development, and so much more.

| Pittsburgh to Enter into Data Sharing Agreement with University of Cincinnati to Enhance Police Crisis Training and Co-Response | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 6, 2021) - This week, Mayor William Peduto will submit to Council a resolution to authorize entry into a data use agreement with the University of Cincinnati’s (UC) Center for Police Research and Policy (CPRP). This agreement allows the CPRP to evaluate outcomes of training and technical assistance for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP). This partnership is part of the "Academic Training to Inform Police Responses” grant awarded to the City by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP)  to inform a national model for crisis response intervention team-building and Public Safety training. <br>The CPRP’s research and evaluation are led by Robin Engel, PhD, Director of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and CPRP. Dr. Engel and the CPRP have a longstanding history of providing such assistance, including technical assistance work with the Philadelphia Police Department and the Pennsylvania State Police, contributing to response to people with mental health conditions and intellectual and development disabilities. Dr. Engel explained, “It is critical to establish partnerships with Public Safety providers to safely respond to persons in crisis and to provide responders with additional training to ensure that they engage co- and alternative response teams.”  <br>"I want to commend Public Safety Director Hissrich, Chief of Police Schubert, and OCH&S Manager Drogowski on this new effort. This is one critical piece of our new model of public health and safety," said Mayor William Peduto. <br>Sheila Roth, PhD, LCSW, EMT, Continuum of Support Program Manager in the City’s Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S), emphasized how technical assistance is critical in preparing PBP officers, AHN Urban Health team members, and OCH&S Community Social Workers for safe co-responses to crises, “This is about building a continuum of support to ensure that the right responder is dispatched to provide engagement at the point of crisis and to provide ongoing care for our community members. We know that first responders are called for myriad needs in our community. With this partnership, we will collaborate with University of Cincinnati and the International Association of Chiefs of Police to elevate community voice, provider experience, best practices, and data to create comprehensive, trauma-informed responses.”  <br>“We are grateful for the opportunity to both build and iteratively evaluate our crisis response while working with the Center for Police Research and Policy to inform training for first responders across the nation,” said Wendell Hissrich, Director of Public Safety Director. Director Hissrich expressed confidence that this collaboration will result in safer, person-centered response to City’s residents, “through this collaboration, the evaluation will inform culture change and equip Public Safety personnel with training that enables improved care for individuals with unmet needs.” <br>This partnership is part of the City’s technical assistance grant "Academic Training to Inform Police Responses” awarded by the BJA and the IACP to the City of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police to inform a national model for crisis response intervention team-building and Public Safety training. This is a joint initiative between UC, Community Health & Safety, Public Safety, and the Bureau of Police. | 6/12/2021 12:10:49 |

| Pittsburgh & Healthy Ride To Launch Electrified Bikes & Mobility Hubs | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 13, 2021) Mayor William Peduto, the Department of Mobility & Infrastructure (DOMI), and Health Ride today announced the Pittsburgh Bike Share Electrification and Mobility Hubs Project. This project prioritizes the addition of new electrified bikes to the existing fleet of traditional Healthy Ride pedal bikes in Pittsburgh. It also includes racks fitted with docking hardware for scooters and other motorized mobility devices. Mobility hubs will be deployed throughout the city at current Healthy Ride bikeshare stations that will better connect Pittsburgh to electrified micromobility. The United States Department of Transportation's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program (CMAQ) has awarded $900,000 for the project. The City will be supporting the grant with an additional $225,000.<br>"Creating greater access to equitable mobility options has been a cornerstone of my Administration," said Mayor William Peduto. "Ensuring our residents have access to quality transportation creates greater opportunity for all citywide. I want to thank the Department of Mobility & Infrastructure and Health Ride for collaborating on this next great step." <br>Healthy Ride will launch an entirely new bikeshare system in 2022 that features e-assist bicycles in addition to traditional pedal bikes. On-street charging stations create a network of infrastructure to support reliable, convenient e-assist bicycles throughout the Healthy Ride network. On December 15, Healthy Ride will begin uninstalling 50 Healthy Ride stations throughout the city in preparation for the electrification installation in 2022.  <br>"In 2021, Healthy Ride began plans to rebuild the bikeshare system holding Equity as the core value,” said David White, Executive Director, Bike Share Pittsburgh. “We established a Community Coalition of partners, customers, and stakeholders to help guide the process of building a better bikeshare program for Pittsburgh. Electrification and e-assist bicycles are essential to this shift.” <br>Electric assist bikes have proven to be wildly popular with new customers to bikeshare. Cities like Madison WI, Charlotte NC and Chicago IL, have seen electric assist bicycles meaningfully increase bikeshare usage by more diverse riders. For more information on Healthy Ride, visit the system’s website [www.healthyridepgh.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://www.healthyridepgh.com%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1639420003986000%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0I4t46KWCHXdx4cmtnzEBF&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1639420003991000&usg=AOvVaw272OPDMVEwe6TjxmZ7O6QN).  <br>**About Pittsburgh Bike Share:**<br>The mission of Pittsburgh Bike Share is to provide Pittsburgh with a joyful, sustainable, and affordable mobility service for all residents and visitors.  <br>Pittsburgh Bike Share is a charitable organization founded in December 2012 and incubated by Bike Pittsburgh. The organization was created due to mounting interest in implementing a municipal bike share system in Pittsburgh from a collection of local leaders: planners at the City of Pittsburgh, business leaders at Walnut Capital, and bicycle/pedestrian advocates at Bike Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Bike Share owns and operates Pittsburgh’s public bike sharing system named Healthy Ride. Healthy Ride is designed to provide an active transportation option for residents, students and visitors of Pittsburgh. <br>**For media inquiries:**<br>**City of Pittsburgh**<br>James Hill <br>james.hill@pittsburghpa.gov <br>**Healthy Ride**<br>Erin Potts <br>erin@pghbikeshare.org | 13/12/2021 15:01:35 |
| Pittsburgh To Hold First Community Meeting For New Davis Avenue Bridge | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 13, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and the Department of Mobility & Infrastructure today announced the first community meeting in preparation for the City of Pittsburgh’s construction of a new Davis Avenue pedestrian and bike bridge from Brighton Heights to historic Riverview Park.  <br>Mayor Peduto allocated funds in 2019 to begin engineering studies for the project. Following the passage of the American Rescue Plan in 2021, the Mayor allocated additional funds totaling over $4 million dollars to complete this project. This new gap funding joined an additional $500,000 grant from the Commonwealth Financing Authority.  <br>“The North Side has long called for their access to Riverview Park to be restored. A new Davis Avenue Bridge is not just a critical infrastructure project, it dramatically increases the quality of life for our Brighton Heights residents,” said Mayor William Peduto. “I was proud to allocate the funding, but projects like these are not done by the City alone. Without partnerships in Harrisburg and Washington DC, these projects do not happen.”  <br>The original Davis Avenue Bridge was constructed in 1898 and rehabbed in 1986. The bridge was demolished in May of 2009 due to serious structural deterioration. Since that time, the residents of Brighton Heights and Marshall-Shadeland have had direct access to their regional CitiParks North Side park severely limited. Mayor Peduto, Senator Wayne Fontanta, Representative Emily Kinkead, and Councilman Bobby Wilson collectively worked to provide funding from all three levels of government to fully fund the project.  <br>“I was proud to advocate for and help bring state funds to this worthwhile project that has been 20 years in the making,” said State Senator Wayne Fontana. “I’m pleased federal, state and city officials were once again able to work together to make this important project come to fruition. Restoring access from Brighton Heights to Riverview Park was a priority for many Brighton Heights residents and I’m excited for the neighborhood."<br>“When I ran for this office, I made rebuilding the Davis Avenue Bridge, and reconnecting parts of my district that have been separated for more than a decade, a cornerstone of my commitment to advocating for my constituents,” said State Representative Emily Kinkead. “I am proud that my partnership with Councilman Bobby Wilson and Mayor Peduto has paid off for the residents of the Northside. I am ready to get shovels in the ground to reconnect our communities.”  <br>The project will see the construction of a multi-use pedestrian bridge over Woods Run Avenue and valley. The bridge will seek to emulate its historic predecessor while embracing new technology to minimize construction costs and impacts on the adjacent neighborhoods. In accordance with stakeholder wishes, the bridge will not be vehicular.  <br>"In August 2021, I was proud to announce that the City of Pittsburgh had committed to spending $2 million to reconstruct the Davis Avenue Bridge,” said Councilman Bobby Wilson. “This bridge will reconnect Brighton Heights, the largest neighborhood on the Northside, to Riverview Park, the largest and only regional park on the Northside. Now, I am looking forward to the first public meeting to learn about the plans and construction timeline of this vital bike and pedestrian bridge in District One."  <br>The first public community meeting regarding the project is being held by the Department of Mobility & Infrastructure tonight at 6:30 PM on Zoom.  <br>**Zoom Meeting Details**<br>Date: December 13, 2021, 6:30PM <br>Location: Zoom <br>**Join Zoom Meeting:**<br>https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87537256614?pwd=UUlTMnU4ak9yVDBqZmNWNWF6MDBUdz09 <br>Meeting ID: 875 3725 6614 <br>Passcode: 636138<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16724_FINAL_DAVIS_AVE_SOCIAL_MEDIA.jpg) | 13/12/2021 10:19:56 |

"These actions will lead to once in a lifetime opportunities for local business owners and expand the historic New Granada block in the Hill District."<br>The AoH Storefront Façade Grant Program is intended to improve the physical appearance of commercial storefronts in Pittsburgh’s seven AoH commercial corridors, improve the shopping experience for neighborhood residents and visitors, increase revenue for small businesses, and create local jobs.  <br>The guidelines were previously presented to the URA Board at its meeting held on November 16, 2021.

| Pittsburgh Announces Progress In Penn Circle Two-Way Conversion | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 15, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) today announced progress is being made on the Penn Circle Two-Way Conversion Project.<br>The project will convert Station and Euclid Streets in the East Liberty neighborhood from one-way traffic in to two-way, multi-modal neighborhood-scale streets. Improvements to the roadways include new signals, bike lanes, curb bump-outs and other traffic calming measures to increase pedestrian and bike safety.<br>“Undoing the wrongs of urban renewal efforts of the 1950’s and 1960’s is an essential task,” said Mayor William Peduto. “The community deserves a connected street grid that is safe for all users. Restoring Penn Circle to a two-way neighborhood scale street and recent affordable housing investments in East Liberty helps to develop a city for all.” <br>In November, the URA selected Michael Baker International for construction management and inspection services. Michael Baker recently completed a similar two-way conversion project in Allegheny Center in the Northside.<br>“We can never fully repair the damage done and legacy created by Urban Renewal projects of the past, but we do have a responsibility to remediate where we can,” said URA Executive Director Greg Flisram. “The final phase of converting this ring road back to a traditional urban street grid will reconnect the neighborhood for the people who live there, not just those that traverse it.”<br>The URA, in partnership with Mackin Engineering and Michael Baker, will be issuing the bid release for construction services in mid-January. Only PennDOT pre-qualified contractors will be eligible to bid on the project. Bids will remain open for 4-5 weeks. Once a construction firm has been selected, work is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2022. | 15/12/2021 10:36:34 |
| City & URA Partner With Manchester Citizens Corporation & Millcraft Investments To Advance Esplanade Development | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 15, 2021) The Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) Board of Directors is set to vote tomorrow on the sale of URA-owned property to Esplanade Partners, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Millcraft Investments, Inc., for $1.5 million to advance Phase I of the Esplanade development. The approximately 5.59 acres owned by the URA are located along the Ohio River just north of the Rivers Casino and the West End Bridge in the Chateau neighborhood.<br>“The construction of Route 65 separated a beautiful and historic neighborhood from its riverfront, and this project begins to bring them back together. The relationship forged between the Manchester community and Millcraft is the type of community driven development we need to truly create equity and opportunity in every neighborhood. I want to thank Lucas Piatt and LaShawn Burton-Faulk for their partnership, vision and commitment to invest in both the physical community and the people of Manchester and Chateau," said Mayor William Peduto.<br>Esplanade will be a major redevelopment of the URA-owned brownfield parcels, along with four surrounding privately-owned, underutilized industrial parcels. The entire project will transform an approximately 15-acre site into a mixed-use development with a wide variety of uses centered around a pavilion conceived as an indoor extension of the riverfront open space. The pavilion will include a courtyard/winter garden that will be the hub for a restaurant, fresh food market, and other experiential programing. The exterior will feature areas for public seating and gathering, along with other amenities. It will be available to the public year-round and accessible from either the Esplanade streets or the riverfront.   <br>Phase I of the project will utilize the URA parcels and include some improvements on the surrounding parcels. Included are the 45,000 square foot pavilion building; a 300-unit apartment building containing both affordable and market-rate housing and retail space; a 15,000 square foot space supporting a 53-meter Ferris wheel; a 550-space public parking garage; and a mixed-purpose marina including a public pier, public safety uses, houseboats, and seasonal and transient slips.    <br>The plan also includes additional environmental and recreation improvements such as the relocating and enhancing the Three Rivers Heritage Trail, stabilizing and re-vegetating the river's edge, restoring native plants, cultivating green infrastructure, and maintaining active and passive open space. Plans for the open space include retail kiosks to be used as incubator or temporary operating spaces for local entrepreneurs; splash park and ice-skating amenities; a park-like amphitheater for small performances and local music; passive reflection and quiet zones; and historical/educational placards focused on local figures and events.   <br>The budget for Phase I is approximately $236 million.   <br>"We are excited to be moving to the next steps of the Esplanade project. We are especially thankful for our partnership with our neighbors in the Manchester, Chateau and North Side communities as we work together to reconnect the neighborhoods and transform old industrial land into an active riverfront destination for everyone to enjoy. We are grateful to the City and URA for their support," said Lucas Piatt, owner and CEO of Millcraft Investments.   <br>"Over the last few months, a strong relationship has developed between Millcraft, Manchester Citizens and myself,” said Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle. “This is critical because it helps to ensure that Esplanade is not an isolated development, but rather a development that reconnects Chateau to the larger historic community. The relationship is also critical to ensure the development provides connectivity, wealth building opportunities, affordable housing, business development and sustainability for residents of Manchester, and the region."   <br>The developer has committed to continuing good faith efforts to work with Manchester Citizens Corporation and community stakeholders to meet community objectives for connectivity, job creation and educational opportunity, sustainability, a community benefits agreement, financing, and affordable housing prior to closing.    <br>“MCC its board of directors and myself are so grateful that Mayor William Peduto and his Administration made neighborhood comprehensive plans a priority,” said Manchester Citizens Corporation Executive Director LaShawn Burton-Faulk. “Manchester’s neighborhood plan has called out equity, connectivity and sustainability as drivers for transformative community development. The Esplanade, through hard work and partnership, will create a community benefits agreement, based on commitment that will allow Manchester Chateau to become a regional asset. We’d also like to thank Councilman Lavelle for his guidance and input on this project.”<br>"From land reclamation to wealth building, job creation, increased housing opportunities, and encouraging sustainable development, there is a lot to like about Esplanade," said URA Executive Director Greg Flisram. "We are excited to see this mixed-use project, which includes affordable housing, advance forward with the Manchester community in a way that seeks to reconnect the neighborhood to a revitalized riverfront." | 15/12/2021 12:39:15 |

| Pittsburgh Receives $1.4M In Grant Funding For Pedestrian Wayfinding Project | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 13, 2021) This week, Mayor William Peduto will submit a resolution to City Council to accept $1.4 million in funding for the Pittsburgh Pedestrian Wayfinding Project. The resolution authorizes a reimbursement agreement with PennDOT District 11 for funding provided by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission’s Transportation Alternatives Set-Aside Program. <br>The program will establish a world class pedestrian wayfinding system that highlights key landmarks, reinforces a sense of place, and makes it easier for residents and visitors to navigate four key business districts. The first phase includes Downtown, Oakland, the North Side, and the North Shore. The system may also be applied to other neighborhoods in future phases. <br>“I am proud to advance this community driven project as a solution to help residents and visitors better navigate Pittsburgh’s unique topography, bridges, and rivers,” said Mayor William Peduto. “This pedestrian wayfinding system will help connect the city and celebrate what each neighborhood has to offer, with a uniquely Pittsburgh design.” <br>The development of Pittsburgh’s new pedestrian wayfinding system was formulated through a collaboration between the City of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, the Oakland Business Improvement District, the Oakland Transportation Management Association, Walk Ride Northside, Northside Cultural Collaborative, Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission, University of Pittsburgh, and UPMC. <br>The project has engaged thousands of residents and stakeholders throughout the extensive development phases. Since its inception, the group has raised over $700,000 in private funds for design creation and community engagement. Collaborative stakeholder workshops, presentations, site visits, and art commission reviews have been held throughout the process, with visioning, analysis, strategy development, sign design, and programming stages building consensus among the various institutions, both citywide and from each of neighborhoods. <br>The Pittsburgh Pedestrian Wayfinding Project has been fully designed and includes over 50 kiosks and 110 directional signs distributed throughout the four neighborhoods. The project is scheduled to be put out to bid in summer 2022 with installation expected to begin in fall 2022. <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16727_Wayfiner_Web.jpg) | 13/12/2021 12:04:02 |

| City, URA, & Housing Authority Advance Hilltop Urban Farm | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 13, 2021) Mayor William Peduto, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA), and the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) announced today plans to further advance the Hilltop Urban Farm. The URA and HACP have reached an agreement for the URA to purchase the urban farm site at fair market value dependent upon confirmation that the URA has secured full reimbursement for the cost of the acquisition. <br>“I want to thank the leadership of the Hilltop Urban Farm, Hilltop Alliance, Allegheny Land Trust, URA, and Housing Authority for all working together to make this incredible vision come true. 23 acres of farming in our Hilltop will provide job opportunities, agricultural education, community strength and greater food security,” said Mayor William Peduto.  <br>The URA will take board action in January and the HACP will immediately begin the disposition approval process with HUD. At the same time, the URA will be working with the Allegheny Land Trust who is raising funds to acquire the site to provide long term protection of the nation’s largest urban farm.  <br>"What a great way to close out 2021," said Pastor Maurice Trent, Board President of the Hilltop Urban Farm. "We appreciate the dedication and persistence of Mayor Peduto and his team, the Housing Authority and the URA, who have all worked for years to make the farm a reality.

| Mayor Peduto & Veterans Place Partner To Expand Housing For Veterans | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 27, 2021) Mayor William Peduto today announced that the City of Pittsburgh has received a signed judge’s order providing a clear title for 5 parcels on Washington Boulevard that the City will be providing to Veterans Place. The land will now be transferred to the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh - an action already approved by the City Council – who will in turn sell the land to Veterans Place.  <br>Veterans Place plans to construct a three story, multipurpose building, that will provide handicapped accessible housing for veterans. This project will provide additional housing for at-risk and homeless veterans in our region. Additionally, the building will provide supportive services to ensure that veterans have the necessary tools and resources for a sustainable future. <br>“We are excited for this opportunity to convert these once blighted properties into veteran housing that will ensure veterans have a place to call home.  With this investment from the Mayor’s Office, and the City of Pittsburgh, we will continue to combat veteran homelessness in this region. Through this support, we will ensure that veteran homelessness is brief, rare and non re-occurring,” said Rob Hamilton, Executive Director and Army Veteran. <br>“Support for our veterans is very personal to me,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Veterans Place has been a fantastic partner with my administration and I am thrilled we were able to get this across the finish line before I left office. This project will take blighted, abandoned homes in a community and turn it into a critically needed housing for those that served our country.” | 27/12/2021 10:46:25 |
| Mayor William Peduto Signs Budget & Releases New Public Engagement Budget Tool | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 28, 2021) Mayor William Peduto and the Office of Management & Budget (OMB) released a new budget tool today to help the public engage in the budgeting process.  <br>Mayor Peduto also signed into law the 2022 Operating and Capital Budget and balanced 5 Year Plan.  The budget anticipates 2022 revenue collection of $658,802,293. That is an increase of almost $180 million compared to when Mayor Peduto took office. Mayor Peduto’s citywide equitable development strategy, enhancements to the city planning and permitting system, transformation of the URA, and international leadership has attracted new jobs and residents to the City of Pittsburgh. These polices have allowed the City of Pittsburgh to exit Act 47, create a 5-year balanced budget and invest in critical infrastructure, our city workers and facilities, parks and neighborhood investments, and affordable housing.  <br>“The City of Pittsburgh is in a much stronger financial position today, than we were when I took office in 2015,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Our economic development strategy has allowed us to make record investments in equity, in our neighborhoods, in our infrastructure, and in our people. That being said, for Pittsburgh to truly have a long term financially sustainable future that can withstand tremendous economic shocks, we still need Harrisburg to provide meaningful reform of our antiquated tax structure.”  <br>To allow residents to take a more active role in both the budgeting process and the tax reform conversation, Mayor Peduto and OMB released a new version of the Balancing Act budget simulation tool. This is a simple tool that increases transparency, encourages public participation, and provides insight to the difficult decisions elected officials are faced with. The tool provides an avenue for residents to adjust various revenues and expenditures to align resources that matter most to them. The goal is to increase participation and obtain feedback that is considered while identifying initiatives or services that are important to the public.  <br>A new feature to the tool now will allow the opportunity for residents to create new taxes or adjust the taxation levels and see the impacts on the City revenues and services. The tool also informs residents whether the tax change requires legislative action from the state legislature, city council, or both to legally implement. Residents can explore the new tool [here](https://pittsburgh.abalancingact.com/city-of-pittsburgh-2022-operating-budget).<br>City Residents can also continue to receive a tax receipt specific to their payments and participate in a capital budget simulation tool [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/omb/budget-tax-receipt-simulation).<br>![Mayor William Peduto signing Budget & Releases New Public Engagement Budget Tool](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16834_16832_thumbnail_IMG_6888.jpg) | 28/12/2021 14:38:46 |

| City of Pittsburgh & Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank Launch Pilot Program | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 29, 2021) Mayor William Peduto, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, and the Office of Community Health & Safety is launching a new pilot program Wednesday in partnership with Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank (“The Food Bank”) to ensure Pittsburgh residents in crisis with immediate need and high engagements with Public Safety have access to shelf stable food.  <br>This pilot is focused on meeting the immediate needs of residents who are identified through the Office of Community Health & Safety’s and Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire’s High Utilizer Program. The program, developed by Lt. Chad Hirosky and Dr. Sheila Roth, receives referrals from firefighters and makes home visits to people who frequently call 911 for non-emergency health and safety situations. The goal of the program is to ensure that people maintain dignity and have proper care in their homes. Boxes of shelf stable food provided by the Food Bank will be delivered to these residents through responding firefighters.  The Food Bank will then be positioned to connect High Utilizers to pantries that meet their needs and location as well as connect them to further assistance such as SNAP enrollments through the Food Bank’s newly developed Community Connections Department.<br>“This pilot program with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and the Office of Community Health & Safety is one more innovative tool in our toolbox to fulfill our mission, which is to feed people in need and mobilize our community to eliminate hunger.  When firefighters identify a household in crisis, we want to be able to provide them with food assistance as quickly as possible.  This new initiative gives families immediate support and then further connects them to resources that can provide stability in the future,” said President and CEO of Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, Lisa Scales.   <br>“Too many members of our community have unmet needs, including food insecurity, that impacts their mental and physical wellbeing,” said Mayor William Peduto.  “Working with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and OCH&S and the Food Bank, we are able to pair high utilizers of public safety services with shelf stable food to improve the overall health of our residents.” | 29/12/2021 10:09:53 |
| City's Director Of Management & Budget Departs For New Opportunity | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (December 29, 2021) The Office of Mayor William Peduto has announced that Director in the Office of Management and Budget Kevin Pawlos is leaving his role with the City.  <br>Pawlos started working for the City in August 2012, as a budget analyst in the Office of Management and Budget. He held many different roles throughout his time with the city, including Senior Budget Analyst, Operating Budget Manager, and Assistant Director of the Operating Budget. Mayor Peduto [appointed](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3275) him Director of the Office of Management and Budget in September 2019.  <br>Under Pawlos’ leadership, the City’s Office of Management and Budget served as a strategic partner to ensure effective and efficient use of resources to sustain the delivery of quality services to residents, establish and maintain sound fiscal policies, and deliver a clear and accurate picture of the City’s current and future financial position. The Office of Management and Budget also navigated new financial challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including identifying budget cuts to help save the City from employee layoffs in 2021. Among his many accomplishments throughout his career with the City, Pawlos led efforts to:  <br>- Receive an updated credit rating from S&P to AA- in 2019 as well as favorable and stable credit ratings in 2021 despite the financial challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>- Manage a grants office that secured 103 grants totaling $46 million since 2019 <br>- Successfully transition to the use of electronic signatures and contract processing at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>- Utilize a program-based and priority-based budgeting approach to the annual operating budget process. <br>- Manage a city-wide fleet program that purchased several alternative fuel vehicles, including CNG refuse packers, hybrid police cruisers, and electric sedans and pickup trucks for city operations. <br>“Kevin was a key member of our leadership team through a period of great economic uncertainty,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Kevin’s leadership and strategic approach helped the City transition from exiting Act 47 to building a healthy $120M rainy day fund to weathering the hit of COVID without any layoffs to now implementing a balanced budget plan for the next 5 years using key investments from the American Rescue Plan.” <br>Pawlos’ last day with the City of Pittsburgh is will be in late January.

| Mayor Peduto Recognizes Historic Transformation of Department of Permits, Licenses, & Inspections | In 2015, the Bureau of Building Inspection in the Department of Public Safety was reorganized into the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections. The restructure focused on utilizing technology and certifying staff to properly administer and enforce construction code requirements and carry out code enforcement activities, which resulted in a 75% reduction of clerical staff, and a doubling of fully certified plan review and inspection staff by 2020. <br>With a trained and fully certified staff, PLI adopted Service Level Agreements (SLA) for every function to dictate response times for plan reviews, inspection requests, and application intake, ensuring consistent and timely responses for customers and residents. Currently PLI exceeds all service level agreements.<br>PLI achieved the fastest plan review times consistently and ever recorded, improving each year from 2015 through 2021. In 2021, PLI’s plan reviewers completed initial commercial construction reviews in an average of 20 days, two weeks faster than the 30-day service level agreement. For residential construction, initial reviews within 7 days, or in half the time of the standard 15-day service level agreement.<br>In 2014, 44% of plan reviews were completed within the 30- and 15-day periods. Since 2018, 99.9% of the reviews meet the service level agreement even with 9,000 reviews annually and added reviews for fire alarm, fire suppression, energy, and accessibility. The volume of inspections has increased since 2018 when the department conducted 27,000 and in 2021 conducted 34,000 inspections.<br>The department established the creation of “minor alterations” permits, to allow Application Technicians to issue repair permits same-day or next day to customers for work that did not require plan review.  In 2022, PLI will launch accelerated review services to allow customers to pay for faster reviews, and launch plan review meetings to meet before permit submission to provide guidance for a fee.  <br>Technology plays a critical role in the transformation. Inspectors once equipped only with pen and paper, are now issued cell phones and laptops to take customer calls throughout the workday, schedule inspections on-the-go, and record inspection outcomes on site and in real time. Paper files have been replaced by a reliable system that includes photos, inspector notes, correspondence, and court tracking.<br>Additionally, it has never been easier to apply for a permit or license in the City of Pittsburgh with the creation of OneStopPGH. Customers can submit applications concurrently to Permits, Licenses, and Inspections, City Planning, Fire, and the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure online 24/7 and pay with a credit card or e-check eliminating waiting in line or paying for parking Downtown.<br>"There is no department that has transformed more since I took office than PLI," said Mayor William Peduto. "I want to thank Directors Maura Kennedy and Sarah Kinter, as well as all of the hardworking staff in PLI. It is their vision, dedication, and hard work that has turned this department into a successful 21st century operation." <br>PLI worked with City Council to update the licensing codes for the first time since the 1980s, right-sized and standardized fees, adopted the highest standards for demolition to minimize environmental impacts including adopting deconstruction demolition methods, and created a unit of vacant property inspectors to routinely inspect condemned structures.<br>The reorganization of BBI to PLI also invested in employees in addition to certification and continuing education standards, all supervisors attend annual leadership, coaching, and conflict resolution trainings to improve departmental steering.  PLI has transformed from a largely white, male staff to a more racially and gender-diverse workplace. Through robust recruitment and support, PLI’s employees of color has tripled since 2014, and the number of women in technical roles has doubled. | 29/12/2021 12:29:26 |
