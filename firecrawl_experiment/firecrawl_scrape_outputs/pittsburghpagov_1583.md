# Forestry Events

![Happy Arbor Day](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/parks/images/forestry/17813_arbor-day.png)

![Tree City USA](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/parks/images/forestry/17811_tree-city-usa.png)The City of Pittsburgh is celebrating 20 years as a Tree City USA. The Tree City Certification Program is operated by the Arbor Day Foundation and has several requirements, including:

- An annual budget of at least $2 per capita for tree work
- An annual proclamation recognizing Arbor Day
- An annual tree planting celebration
- Shade Tree Commission in place to preserve and protect trees

We traditionally fly our Tree City USA flag on Mt. Washington from Earth Day to Arbor Day (April 22nd to April 26th), and will be kicking off our green season with a service day at the Forestry field office by planting one spruce tree for every year we have been a Tree City USA!

## **Earth Day – April 22, 2025**

Earth Day, celebrated annually on April 22nd, is a global day focused on raising awareness and promoting environmental protection, encouraging actions like recycling, reducing waste, and advocating for environmental policies. Forestry will have a kick-off celebration at the City-County Building portico from Noon to 1pm featuring various speakers and music. Other activities around the City include community cleanups, tree planting and educational activities.

## **Arbor Day – April 25, 2025**

Arbor Day is a day dedicated annually to public tree-planting usually observed in late April that _inspires people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees. T_ o celebrate Pittsburgh’s 20th Anniversary of being a Tree City USA, there are a variety of events happening during the month of April. On Saturday, April 26, a community-oriented celebration takes place at Allegheny Commons Park on the North Side from 11am to 2pm. The event features music, food and a fun tree climb activity for kids. So, come on out and enjoy the festivities!

The City isn't the only group standing out in support of Arbor Day and our City's tree canopy. Greenfield Elementary has been nominated as the first [k-12 Tree Campus](https://www.arborday.org/programs/tree-campus-k-12/) in the City of Pittsburgh, and is one of only two k-12 schools statewide to be in the running for this honor. Duquesne University has earned the status of [Tree Campus USA](https://www.arborday.org/programs/tree-campus-higher-education/) certified institution through the Arbor Day Foundation, joining Pitt, Chatham and Carnegie Mellon University in showing our City's commitment to a health urban forest.
