# Pittsburgh: A Great City for College Students

Hello, I’m Jeremy — I grew up right outside of Pittsburgh, and I’m very proud to say that I currently attend the University of Pittsburgh.

When most people think of a “college town,” Pittsburgh might not be the first city that comes to mind, but our universities are becoming more and more influential on the city’s culture. Pittsburgh is home to six four-year institutions with more than 15 others within 50 miles.

Our [universities](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/about-pittsburgh/relocation/education/colleges-universities/), and brilliant students, are making innovations every day in healthcare, AI, engineering, arts, business and so many more fields. I think our city is an amazing place for college students, with so many vibrant neighborhoods, delicious food and exciting [events](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/events-festivals/). At any point of the year, when our college students want to wander off campus for a new experience, Pittsburgh always has something fun to do.

Here are some of my favorite activities to do as a college student in Pittsburgh:

## Attend a Pittsburgh Penguins Game

There are few pro sports cities in the country like Pittsburgh, and no Pittsburgh experience is complete without checking out any of our black and gold teams. The best pro sports experience for college students is, without a doubt, the [Pittsburgh Penguins](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/pittsburgh-penguins/)’ student rush discount program.

The games are always exciting, [PPG Paints Arena](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/ppg-paints-arena-penguins-guide/) is gorgeous and the Pens have consistently been one of the NHL’s best teams. The student rush experience is very easy — once you sign up for tickets, you can purchase them for between $15-25 on the morning of any game via text alerts.

## Wander the Museum and Art Scene

For those into art and museum days, Pittsburgh has [a lot of great options](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pittsburgh-visual-arts-checklist/). Right in the heart of Oakland is the [Carnegie Museums of Art](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/carnegie-museum-of-art-and-natural-history/) and [Natural History](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/carnegie-museum-of-natural-history/). Two museums housed in one building, there are thousands of works to look at, from dinosaur skeletons to Greek marble sculptures.

[The Andy Warhol Museum](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/the-andy-warhol-museum/) and the [Mattress Factory](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/media/press-releases/pittsburgh-a-cultural-phenomenon/) are on the North Shore and Northside, respectively, and are local favorites with so much inspiration for your Instagram pics. As a Pitt student, I also can’t leave out [Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/phipps-conservatory-and-botanical-gardens/) and its unique walkthrough experience. Phipps is just a short walk from the Carnegie Museums and a favorite date spot for a lot of my friends.

## Explore Downtown

You haven’t truly experienced Pittsburgh until you take a walk and wander around Downtown a little. Point State Park is an amazing place to take a walk with a 360-degree view of Downtown and each of Pittsburgh’s rivers. [Market Square](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/a-guide-to-market-square/) is a great place to eat in the middle of Downtown, with plenty of restaurant options and tons of seats in the middle of the square.

Two of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh are the [Duquesne and Monongahela Inclines](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/how-to-ride-the-pittsburgh-inclines/) on Mt. Washington. Both have breathtaking views of Downtown Pittsburgh that are unique to our city.

## Uncover New Food Spots

As much as I love to stay in Oakland and grab a bite at CHiKN or STACK’D, a lot of Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods have really cool food options. Squirrel Hill is one of my favorite city neighborhoods and has a lot of cool little restaurants. Most notably are two of my favorite pizza places, [Mineo’s Pizza House](http://mineospizza.com/squirrel-hill.html) and [Aiello’s Pizza](http://aiellospizza.com/squirrel-hill/), just steps away from each other on Murray Avenue.

A ton of the city’s best Asian food options are in the Shadyside neighborhood. And the [Strip District](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/the-strip-district-a-local-pittsburgh-favorite/) is a Pittsburgh food staple, with all its unique markets and shops, not to mention the original [Primanti Bros](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/primanti-bros-strip-district/).

Pittsburgh has so much to explore, and just about everything for anyone’s taste. I think Pittsburgh is an awesome place for college students because there is nothing like our city and our ever-changing culture. Our city is friendly, unique, great for sports and always innovating. I can’t wait to see the continued impact that the students of Pittsburgh will have on the city.
