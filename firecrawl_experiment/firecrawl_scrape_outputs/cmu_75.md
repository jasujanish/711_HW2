# Work That Matters

### What if all communities were future-ready?

### Securing a Healthier, More Resilient World

CMU researchers are working to safeguard lives, secure our future and strengthen national resilience. That means we [save lives](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2024/may/autonomous-trauma-care-extends-golden-hour-for-saving-lives), help systems adapt in the face of disruption, and engineer life-saving [medical breakthroughs](https://engineering.cmu.edu/organs/). We protect [community health](https://delphi.cmu.edu/), strengthen [security and privacy](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/research/index.html), [empower U.S. manufacturing](https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2025/01/08-mfi-empowers-industry.html) and [make streets safer](https://safety21.cmu.edu/what-we-do/). Whether [leveraging energy expertise through AI](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2025/March/intelligent-energy) or preparing for the [next global emergency](https://engineering.cmu.edu/critical-tech-initiative/index.html), our work supports a safer, more sustainable future.
