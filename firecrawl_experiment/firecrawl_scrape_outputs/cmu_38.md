# Office of the Provost

The Office of the Provost advances Carnegie Mellon University's mission for teaching, research and scholarly excellence. The resources we provide nurture the personal, professional and intellectual growth of our community of students, faculty and staff in diverse academic contexts.

Members of the Office of the Provost serve as points of contact on behalf of this division, which plans and guides the policies and practices that shape the academic vision of the university.

CMU community members are encouraged to reach out early in the event planning process if they wish to invite the provost or other senior staff in this office to attend an event.
