# Building & Development Application

The Building And Development Application (BDA) is a new application type that replaces the current Zoning Development Review Application and Building Permit Application. If you're planning a construction project, this will typically be your initial step.

The intent of the Building And Development Application is that it will require no expertise in the construction process. The application uses simplified prompts that ask only for information relevant to your project. However, this page will provide some key pieces of information.

A Building And Development Application is typically requires for the following scopes:

- Renovation or repair of an existing building or structure
- Constructing an addition to an existing building or structure
- Building a new structure
- Obtaining zoning approval for structures that don't require a permit

Please see [work not requiring a permit](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/Permits/Work-Not-Requiring-a-Permit) for work that can be performed without a PLI permit. Although the Building And Development Application will inform you if you do not require a permit for your work.

## Other Agency Coordination

Every BDA will be reviewed by each of the relevant departments. This includes PLI, DCP, and DOMI. The departments will determine what is required for your project and will inform you of any additional required permits. Please see [Other Agency Coordination](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/Contacts/Other-Agency-Coordination) for more information on processes related to other agencies that may relate to your permit scope. There is no need to apply for a Zoning Development Review application. The reviews associated with the ZDR are now incorporated into the BDA to remove the need for you to apply twice for the same scope. If a DOMI permit is required for the BDA scope, a DOMI reviewer will create a sub-permit for you and inform you of the requirement.
