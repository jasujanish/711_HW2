# Broadway Avenue Public Realm Project

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/images/1711_bapr-logo.jpg) The City of Pittsburgh will redesign the Broadway Avenue streetscape in Beechview from Fallowfield Station to Wenzell Avenue. The project, which completed its planning phase in mid-late 2018 and is currently in the design phase for construction, is based on the 2011 SMART TRID study and is a result of engaging neighborhood residents, community groups, and stakeholders.

The scope of the project considers new elevated, ADA-accessible transit stops that include shelter from the elements, changes to the roadway, storm-water management infrastructure, and related streetscape improvements such as lighting, seating, and planting. Final improvements, design, and street configuration were determined through the community outreach process and input from the stakeholder group.

![Red Line](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/images/1590_bus.jpg)Broadway Avenue is a business district amidst revitalization by residents, the City, URA, property owners, and private developers. The neighborhood is well served by transit with a connection to downtown by the Port Authority’s Red Line. Many people arrive on Broadway by public transit but their trip does not begin or end at the T stop, it continues to their destination or residence.

This page will be updated as the work on this project progresses. In the meantime, please send comments to Mike Panzitta, Project Manager & Engineer for the Pittsburgh Department of Mobility & Infrastructure ( [Michael.panzitta@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Michael.panzitta@pittsburghpa.gov)). You can also reach out to the Department of City Planning’s Neighborhood Planner for Beechview, Thomas Scharff, at [thomas.scharff@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:thomas.scharff@pittsburghpa.gov "mailto:thomas.scharff@pittsburghpa.gov").
