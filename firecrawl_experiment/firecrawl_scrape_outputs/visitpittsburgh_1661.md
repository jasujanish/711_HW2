# 2025 Great Pittsburgh Book Crawl

The [Great Pittsburgh Book Crawl](https://www.pghbookcrawl.com/) is making its debut in 2025 for a week filled with exploring and supporting local and independent bookstores. From May 10 through 18, over 20 bookstores in the Pittsburgh area will be giving out passports and stamps for those passports, which you can use to win a prize at the end of the event!

### How it works...

A book crawl encourages you to stop and visit participating stores during the dates of the crawl and shop there inventory. Pittsburgh's book crawl features over 20 local and independent bookstores just waiting for you to stop by! Pick up a passport book from your first stop and make sure to get it stamped at every store along the way. Get enough stamps and you'll be entered to win a raffled prize put together by every store in the crawl.
