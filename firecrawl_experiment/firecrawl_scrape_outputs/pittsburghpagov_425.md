# Prevailing Wage

In the spring of 2010, the City of Pittsburgh enacted the Service Worker Prevailing Wage Ordinance to require projects subsidized by public monies to pay wages that reflect local rates.

The Prevailing Wage is based on studying local wage conditions and three sources of rate information: [Bureau of Labor Statistics Market Rates](https://www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm), local Collective Bargaining Agreement Rates, and [McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act Rates](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/government-contracts/service-contracts). Prevailing wage rates for [Building Service(PDF, 229KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/documents/2024-25-building-service-pw-rates.pdf "2024-25 Building Service PW Rates.pdf") , [Food Service(PDF, 253KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/documents/23416_food_service_pw_rates.pdf), [Grocery Workers(PDF, 208KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/documents/390_grocery_worker_prevailing_wage.pdf), and [Hotel Workers(PDF, 195KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/documents/23958_pittsburgh_hotel_total_labor_january_2024_.pdf)  are determined by the Controller’s Office.

In accordance with the Pittsburgh City Code, the Mayor’s Office of Equal Protection monitors City contractors’ compliance with prevailing wage requirements in building and food services and grocery and hotel projects with City contracts or subsidies over $100,000.
