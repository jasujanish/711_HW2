![City-County_Buildingr light up night](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/special-events/images/city-county_buildingrz.jpg?dimension=pageimage&w=480)

## MENORAH LIGHTING

DATE & TIME: Thursday, December 26, 2024 at 5 p.m.

PLACE:  City-County Building

Join Mayor Ed Gainey and community leaders in lighting the giant 12-foot Menorah located in front of the City-County Building.  The Menorah serves as a beacon of light, symbolizing freedom and peace for all.  The celebration includes live music and Chanukah refreshments of latkes and donuts.

## PITTSBURGH'S OFFICIAL CHRISTMAS TREE

Thank you to Guardian Angels Parish of Natrona Heights, Springdale Campus, for donating the official 2024 holiday tree, a 40-foot Blue Spruce.

Pittsburgh's official Christmas Tree was first erected at the construction site of the City-County Building in 1915.  For more than a century, a beautiful live evergreen (the _only_ live holiday tree Downtown) has graced the front steps of our seat of government.  Visitors enjoy hundreds of larger than life ornaments, including Pittsburgh’s Coat of Arms designed by Wendell August Forge, and 90 distinct ornaments, each bearing the name of Pittsburgh's beloved neighborhoods.  Be sure to spot your favorite!

## TREE LIGHTING ON HIGHMARK LIGHT UP NIGHT®

The City of Pittsburgh kicks off the holidays on November 23 at its official tree lighting ceremony presented by Clearview as part of Highmark Light Up Night ®. Festivities along Grant Street include live music, light show, fireworks, food trucks, crafts, games, and a one-of-a-kind gingerbread house display.

DATE:  **Saturday, November 23, 2024** from 4 - 7 p.m.

PLACE:  City-County Building portico and along Grant Street, Downtown Pittsburgh
