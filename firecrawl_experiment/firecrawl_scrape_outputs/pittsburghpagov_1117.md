# Get Involved

## Engagement Opportunities

The City’s neighborhood planning process includes many opportunities for active involvement:

- **Steering Committee**: A group of 20-30 representatives of a broad range of interests in the community. This group guides the planning process, with members also expected to join Action Teams.
- **Action Teams**: Topic-focused groups that spend a year developing projects and programs. These groups are open to all interested community members and stakeholders.
- **Community Events:** Due to COVID-19, there will be few public in-person events for the foreseeable future. In place of these events, online engagement will occur using an innovative new website to be launched shortly.
- **Online Engagement:** [Engage PGH](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/) is designed to work on mobile devices, can be read by screen readers and translating software, and allows people to engage when it's convenient for them. In the coming months, we will roll out additional features and technologies to overcome the digital divide.

## Previous Community Events and Workshops

[**Planning Education Series**(PDF, 732KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/documents/6650_education_series_flyer_-_oakland_-_2019-07-22_updated.pdf)

To help communities fully engage in the upcoming planning process, the City of Pittsburgh, partner organizations, and non-profits organized events to introduce the topics of the neighborhood planning process in a fun and informal environment. This allowed interested stakeholders to learn about topics before the planning work begins, so they can be better informed and more effective advocates for their communities.
