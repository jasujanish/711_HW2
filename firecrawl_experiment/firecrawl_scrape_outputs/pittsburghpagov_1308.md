# About Mobility and Infrastructure

The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure was established by Ordinances 15, 16 and 17 of 2017. It is the newest department of the City of Pittsburgh.

The Department is responsible for the transportation of people and goods throughout the City of Pittsburgh, and for managing the operation of and access to the public right-of-way (the sidewalks, curbs, streets, and bridges that make up our network).

## City's Mobility Principles

1. No one dies or is seriously injured traveling on city streets.
2. Every household in Pittsburgh can access fresh fruits and vegetables within 20 minutes travel of home, without the requirement of a private vehicle.
3. All trips less than 1 mile are easily and enjoyably achieved by non-vehicle travel.
4. No household must spend more than 45% of household income to satisfy basic housing, transportation and energy needs.
5. The combined cost of transportation, housing and energy does not exceed 45% of household income for any income group.
6. The design, maintenance and operation of city streets reflects the values of our community.
