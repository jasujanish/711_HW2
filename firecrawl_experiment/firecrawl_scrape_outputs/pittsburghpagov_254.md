# Resources for Subrecipients

This page is a resource for organizations which have been awarded CDBG funds through Public Service Grant (PSG) and/or Neighborhood Economic Development (NED) Grant programs.

## Eligibility

To qualify for funding, organizations must have the following in addition to PSG and NED program guidelines:

- Active 501(c)(3) nonprofit status
- Current registration through SAM.gov
- Current general liability insurance coverage
- Current workers comp insurance if your organization has staff on payroll

## SAM.gov Registration

For organizations that are registering with SAM.gov for the first time, first obtain a UEI and then register with [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/content/home).

Be aware that even if your organization has a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), _you may not be fully registered_. Registration is a separate process after receiving a UEI, and must be updated annually.

City staff have prepared the following guides:

- [Use this guide if you have not received a UEI(PDF, 6MB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/omb/documents/resources-for-subrecipients/24088_sam.gov_full_registration_guide.pdf)
- [Use this guide if you have a UEI but have not completed registration(PDF, 3MB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/omb/documents/resources-for-subrecipients/24087_sam.gov_uei_no_full_registration.pdf)

If you have additional questions, contact your Program Coordinator for further assistance.

## Training

In December 2024, OMB-CD held a training for subrecipients, covering contract documents and the reimbursement process. A video of the report is available here:

## Contract Documents

If your organization has been awarded funding, the first step to accessing those funds is to complete a contract with the City. Awarded organizations must submit the items listed in the checklists below to help fill in their contract. Your Program Coordinator will use the documents you provide to create a contract. Be sure to select the correct document for Public Service or NED funds.
