# Pittsburgh's Outdoor Movie Scene

Take in some fresh air and the latest blockbuster in one go!

When we say we're going **out** to the movies this summer, we mean literally.

Pittsburgh has plenty of options to catch an outdoor movie! Over the next few months, parks around the area will pop up the big screen; all you have to do is bring your chairs, blankets, snacks, and, of course, friends and family. It's a perfect time to enjoy the nice summer weather, [take a date](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/10-awesome-pittsburgh-summer-date-nights/), or spend an evening relaxing under the stars.

We've rounded up where you can partake in some big picture magic in the great outdoors.
