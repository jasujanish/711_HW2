# Active Shooter/Active Threat

## How to Respond when an Active Shooter/Active Threat Is in Your Vicinity

### If You Run

If there is an accessible escape path, attempt to evacuate the premises. Be sure to:

- Have an escape route and plan in mind.
- Evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow.
- Leave your belongings behind.
- Help others escape, if possible.
- Prevent others from entering the area.
- Follow the instructions of any police officers.
- Do not attempt to move wounded people.
- Call 911 when you are safe.

### If You Hide

If evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide where the active shooter/active threat is less likely to find you. Your hiding place should:

- Be out of the active shooter’s view.
- Provide protection if shots are fired in your direction (i.e., an office with a closed and locked door).
- Not trap you or restrict your options for movement (if possible).

To prevent an active shooter/active threat from entering your hiding place:

- Lock the door.
- Blockade the door with heavy furniture.

### If You Fight

As a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent danger, attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the active shooter/active threat by:

- Acting as aggressively as possible against the attacker.
- Throwing items and improvising weapons such as chairs, books, paperweights, fire extinguishers or other heavy items.
- Using numbers to overwhelm the attacker. There is strength in working together.
- Yelling to startle the attacker and draw attention to the situation.
- Committing to your actions and fighting like your life depends on it.
