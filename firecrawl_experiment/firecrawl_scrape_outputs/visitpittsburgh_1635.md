## Lords (and Ladies) of the Dance

With six stages dedicated to performances, the [live music scene](http://pghirishfest.org/entertainers/) is always one of the top highlights of Pittsburgh Irish Festival. Hear everything from traditional Celtic and folk bands using fiddles, flutes and pipes to contemporary Celtic rock, Irish dance and Celtic-American fusion.

Headlining the 2025 festival is Ally the Piper, who specializes in Celtic instrumentation, such as the Highland Bagpipe, Scottish Smallpipe, Irish whistles, and vocals. Other headliners include fan-favorites Gaelic Storm as well as The Brigideens, The Drowsy Lads, Dennis Doyle, and more. Additional entertainers, Irish comedians, harpists, roving bagpipers and more keep the music and laughs going in this entertainment-packed festival.

## Shamrockin' Food & Drink

You'll be able to smell the mouthwatering Celtic cuisine cooking as soon as you step out of your car! Savor a giant menu of traditional Irish favorites including Irish sausage, Irish stew, boxty pancakes, corned beef and cabbage, Shepherd’s Pie, fish and chips, colcannon, ham and cabbage and more available from a wide variety of [vendors](http://pghirishfest.org/vendors/).

For our 21+ guests, there's plenty to sip including Irish favorites like Guinness, Harp and Smithwick's on tap, specialty drinks and cocktails made with Dubliner Irish Whiskey, Jameson and other Irish liquors, specialty cocktails and non-alcoholic offerings.

My Irish stew in a bread bowl from last year. Heavenly!

## Irish Events & Activities

When you're full, it's time to grab a fresh Guinness and explore the rest of the Pittsburgh Irish Festival. Watch the professionals and amateurs face off at the Five Farms Irish Cream Celtic Kitchen, shop 50+ vendors at the Irish marketplace, meet some good boys at the Irish dog area and learn the incredible history of the secret Hedge School.

**New for 2025** is the Bodhrán Blitz, where traditional drum of Ireland, the bodhrán, takes center stage as the Festival’s hottest goat-thumpers come together to demonstrate the full capabilities of this ancient instrument. Also new this year are activities with the [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/pittsburgh-steelers/), who are heading to Dublin for Ireland's first NFL game this season. More new additions to this year's festival include a traditional Irish breakfast on Sunday, Irish Ghanaian Fusion music, and Celtic wellness.

And don't be afraid to bring the wee folk. Children 12 and under get free admission and will have lots to do! The Leprechaun's Landing area is designed just for them with Irish arts, crafts and games to play or watch them explore as they learn an Irish jig, bounce on an Irish castle and play a round of mini golf.
