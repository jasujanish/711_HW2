# Nighttime Economy

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/public-safety/images/24312_office_of_nighttime_economy_seal_final.jpg) The Office of Nighttime Economy (ONE) is the primary liaison between hospitality and nightlife businesses, their surrounding community groups and residents, and other City of Pittsburgh departments.

As part of a Sociable City Plan, the office was created in 2013 to address the complex issues required to sustain a safe and vibrant social experience for residents and visitors.

**Vision**

Safe and vibrant places to socialize for visitors and Pittsburghers of all ages, cultures and lifestyles.

**Mission**

To retain and grow the value of the social and nighttime economy; encourage safe operations of food, beverage and entertainment businesses; and facilitate collaborative co-existence with communities in which they operate.

Pittsburgh’s burgeoning hospitality scene is a vital component to Pittsburgh’s economy – employing nearly 60,000 workers in our region and generating millions in city revenue.

This office works to support not just the nighttime economy but “life at night” – including many Pittsburghers who work, play and live their lives outside of a 9-5 schedule (Think of industries like healthcare, hotels, Fedex, Amazon, Airport employees, janitorial workers, security and more.)
