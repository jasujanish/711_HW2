# Voting Trustees

The business, property and affairs of the Corporation are managed by or under the direction of a Board of Trustees of the Corporation.

The Board of Trustees shall consist of a minimum of 40 voting members, including ex-officio members, with the number of voting trustees to be determined from time to time by the trustees. Voting trustees members are divided into five classes; one class of trustees is elected each year at the annual meeting to succeed those whose terms expire in that year and to serve for a term of five years.

The term of each trustee typically commences on July 1 following his or her election. A trustee’s term expires on June 30 in the year in which his or her term is concluded, or June 30 following his or her 75th birthday, whichever occurs first. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board of Trustees may grant the status of Emeritus/a Trustee to those members who have made distinguished contributions to the University and who have attained at least age 60 or a maximum of age 75.
