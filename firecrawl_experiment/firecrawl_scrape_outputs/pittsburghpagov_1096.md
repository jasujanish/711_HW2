# Occupancy Only Permit

_The Commercial Building Permit is now part of the [Building and Development Application](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/OneStopPGH/Building-Development-Application)!_

A commercial occupancy only permit is required for the following work on a commercial building or structure:
