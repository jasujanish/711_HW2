# Mobile Vehicle Vendor License

The City of Pittsburgh requires a Mobile Vehicle Vendor License for anyone selling food or goods from an approved vending vehicle on public parking. The vending vehicle shall not remain at any one location for more than (4) four hours while vending.

**Exemptions:** No vending license is required to sell food or goods when vending units are located in the Strip District neighborhood. Vendors that fall under this exception must seek written permission from the building or property owner.

**Food Trucks:** A Mobile Vehicle Vendor License is required to operate a food truck within the City of Pittsburgh. A **Food Truck** is defined as a food establishment that is located upon a vehicle, or which is pulled by a vehicle, where food or beverage is cooked, prepared, and served for individual portion service such as a mobile food kitchen.

Inspections are completed to insure the vendor is properly disposing of waste in minimum 30 gallon combined capacity trash containers (not in City trash cans), not producing loud noises, not vending within 100 feet of a business that sells similar items without permission, capable of movement at all times, and meeting all other requirements of the License.

For a complete list of definitions and requirements, please refer to [Chapter 719: Vendors and Peddlers](https://ecode360.com/45464798#45464798) of the City Code and the PLI [Licensing Rules and Regulations(PDF, 626KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/pli/documents/licensing_rules_regulations.pdf).

Please consult the [maps of prohibited vending locations(PDF, 20MB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/pli/documents/7918_vendor_maps1.pdf) in the City of Pittsburgh. Vending within the shaded boundaries is not permitted.
