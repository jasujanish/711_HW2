Open year round, our Community Recreation Centers are responsible for numerous indoor and outdoor sporting activities, educational programming, crafting and leisure time with fellow community members. They also provide various programming for the city's youth, including afterschool programs as well as CitiCamps in the summer.

You can check out the programs at the center closest to you on our Rec Center Location and Hours page, by simply clicking on the center to view their current seasonal programs.
