# Filing a Complaint

Complaints may be initiated internally or filed by citizens involved in an incident.

Complaints can be faxed, mailed, delivered in person or phoned in.  Complaints can be made by the person directly involved in an incident, a third-party or anonymously.  Regardless of the means a complaint is received, the complainant should provide enough information so that the incident and/or employees can be identified.  Assuming your full cooperation and that of witnesses, OMI staff strives to complete our investigations within 120 days of receiving it, with limited exceptions (an example of which could be the outcome of court proceedings).

A complaint should have the following information:

- Date
- Name(s) of the parties involved
- Your address (if not filed anonymously)
- Your telephone number (if not filed anonymously)
- Description of the incident (date, time, location, etc.)
- Description or the name of the accused employee(s), if known

## Time Constraints

Complaints dealing with police should be made within a period of 90 days after the incident, this is a provision in the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the City of Pittsburgh and Fraternal Order of Police.
