# Finding Fresh Coastal Vibes at Palm Palm

How a new East End escape is keeping the momentum going

By now, you’ve likely heard the buzz around [Palm Palm](https://palmpalmpgh.com/), East Liberty’s newest hot spot owned by Herky and Lisa Pollock with Chef Ed and Amanda Smith. (They all opened downtown’s [Ritual House](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/ritual-house/) together in 2023.) At Palm Palm, think fresh cocktails and shareable plates with coastal influences — all enjoyed inside a bright and soaring space where vacation vibes thrive, from the palm trees towering on the walls to pops of pastel throughout the airy space, juxtaposed against gold fixtures.

Now that it’s been nearly two months since this concept launched (they officially opened Sunday, July 6), we caught up with co-owner Herky — omnipresent local entrepreneur and one of Pittsburgh’s biggest champions — to hear his reflections so far. He describes the restaurant’s vibe as “coastal cool with approachable luxe,” and says the way in which they’ve been received has already exceeded their wildest expectations.

Located in the East End, Palm Palm can be found directly across from [Square Cafe](https://square-cafe.com/) and new women’s sports bar [Title 9](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/title-9-a-new-east-liberty-hangout-welcomes-community-members-to-cheer-on-women-athletes/), and not far from other buzzworthy hangouts like [Hey Babe](https://www.heybabepgh.com/) and [Duo’s](https://www.duos-pgh.com/). On the website, the venue is described as sitting “at the crossroads of Pittsburgh’s most vital institutions — world-class universities, hospitals and the tech industries that fuel our city’s future.” Pollock explains further: “We are from the East End, and we built this specifically for the neighborhood and community. We are very grateful to be a part of the fabric of this community.”

During our visit, some favorite dishes ranged from the brûléed oranges and tuna sushi tots to the mini lobster rolls, shrimp ceviche and whole branzino with refried butter puree, adobo rub and salsa verde. We were dazzled by seasonal delights like the melon salad plus unexpected side items (jicama slaw and coconut-pineapple rice) that threatened to steal the limelight from a tasty seabass main with chimichurri. On the beverage side of things — while we couldn’t help but try the uniquely greens-enhanced Palm Palm Margarita — we were admittedly tempted by other cocktails with catchy names like the Ginny in the Bottle (Bluecoat Gin, lychee, yuzu and hibiscus) and the Passionista (vodka, Passoã, lemon, passionfruit and prosecco.) Thoughtful zero-proof options abound here, too, like housemade sodas that come in flavors like lychee coconut, chocolate egg cream and strawberry passion fruit.

When they initially conceived Palm Palm, the co-owners intended a design more specific to Palm Beach. But things, happily, took an unexpected turn. “We had plans for pink walls, Degourney wallpaper and a safari theme very similar to that of the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach,” Herky says. “Then….our friends at [_Table Magazine_](https://www.tablemagazine.com/) did an article saying that we were opening a restaurant. They used a photograph by Peter Thomas of a Cadillac DeVille in Palm Springs. The next 12 articles all leaned into Palm Springs, and the rest is history. We simply gave what the majority of the people were asking for!”

So how does this space feel special for an entrepreneur who’s already worked on countless projects? “It is joyful,” Herky says. “We want people to take a couple hours away from their lives and have fun and treat it like a vacation!”

Since opening, the team’s been surprised by a few things, like “the total diversity of our clientele,” Herky says. “Our guests are diverse: socioeconomically, racially, gender, age and sexual preference. It is truly a Pittsburgh melting pot!”

When asked what’s next, Herky says they’re looking at adding a larger private dining room and lounge on a different floor, due to customer demand.

And of course we couldn’t end the conversation without learning Herky’s personal go-to order — Palm Palm Margaritas alongside Truffle Spaghettio’s and Parmesan Steak, he shares, which all seem to perfectly complement a huge heaping of gratitude. “We really appreciate the response and are so grateful!” he says.
