# Lactation Rooms as Part of the Facilities Plan

Published on March 28, 2018

**Number:** 2018-02

**By Direction of:** William Peduto, Mayor

**Date:** March 28, 2018

**Whereas**, the Mayor understands the need and importance for gender equity in the City of Pittsburgh; and,

**Whereas**, facilities owned by the City of Pittsburgh should be places where all people – regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, race or creed – should feel welcome; and,

**Whereas**, mothers in Pittsburgh deserve safe, sanitary, and private places to breastfeed and pump breast milk for their children; and,

**Whereas**, these spaces should be available for both employees of the City of Pittsburgh and guests of our various facilities; and,

**Whereas**, the City has already installed two lactations rooms at 414 Grant St. and 200 Ross St.; and,

**Whereas**, the City of Pittsburgh wants to ensure that more city owned facilities provide these rooms for nursing mothers and set example for private business.

**Now, therefore**, I, William Peduto, Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh, by the virtue of the authority vested in me by the City Charter and laws of the City of Pittsburgh do hereby direct the following actions:

1. The Office of Management and Budget will be responsible for developing a policy around the installation of lactation rooms in their facilities plan.


   - When the City is deciding upon renovations and considering building new facilities, the Office of Management and Budget will be required to consider the installation of lactation rooms.
   - These guidelines should be based on need and best practices.

This [Executive Order(PDF, 103KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/documents/executive-orders/lactation_rooms_as_part_of_the_facilities_plan.pdf) shall take effect immediately and remain in effect until amended or rescinded in writing by the Mayor.
