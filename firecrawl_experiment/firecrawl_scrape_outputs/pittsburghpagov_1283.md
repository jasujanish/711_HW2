# PLI Fees

[Download PLI's Current Fee Schedule(PDF, 204KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/pli/documents/fees/pli-fee-schedule-1-1-2025.pdf)

The cost of a permit will now be calculated based on the total construction value of the project. For more info, please download the Fee Schedule or use our Permit Fee Calculator. Please note, if the construction value changes between the time of application and permit issuance, the total cost of your permit may also change.

The fee schedule allows PLI to offer expedited plan review services at the Department’s discretion. Due to current capacity, expedited review is only offered for Fire Alarm and Fire Suppression permit types. PLI will give notice when this service is slated to become available.

Fees can be paid online via the OneStop portal with a credit card or eCheck, or in person at the OneStopPGH Counter at 412 Blvd of the Allies with a credit card, physical check, money order, or cashier’s check. Please note that we cannot accept payment via mail, nor can we accept cash under any circumstances. Physical checks, money orders, and cashier’s checks must be made out to “Treasurer - City of Pittsburgh.” Please also note that all credit card and eCheck transactions will generate a small processing fee.
