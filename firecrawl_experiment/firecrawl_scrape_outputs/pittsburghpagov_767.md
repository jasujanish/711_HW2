People want to plant trees for various reasons. Some want shade and beauty. Others want to increase the value of their property. Still others wish to memorialize a loved one with a lasting, growing tribute. Whatever the reason, if you would like to see a tree planted on public property, it requires contact with the City of Pittsburgh Forestry Division.
