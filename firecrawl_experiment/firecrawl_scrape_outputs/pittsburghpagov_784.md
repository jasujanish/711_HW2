# Our Parks

**Explore Nearly 3,800 Acres Over 176 Parks**

## Pittsburgh's Regional Parks

Our regional parks are the signature open spaces of Pittsburgh.

These parks draw tens of thousands of visitors from throughout our City and the region. The public can attend grand civic events, play, and learn. Each park has a unique identity shaped by its cultural resources, historic landscape, natural features, and recreational amenities.

The Department of Public Works and CitiParks maintain approximately 1,920 acres of regional park land distributed across five parks.
