In 1942, Lieutenant Colonel Richard K. Mellon and his sister Sarah Mellon Scaife offered the City of Pittsburgh the Mellon estate as a public park.

In June of the following year, City Council formally accepted the offer of the 10 or 11-acre plot of ground along Fifth Avenue. The park was donated in memory of Richard Beatty Mellon and his wife Jennie King Mellon. The park opened in the spring of 1944.

That same year the adjacent C. D. Marshall property, which includes the mansion at Fifth Avenue, was offered to the city as an addition to the park.

The Mellon Park Walled Garden allows you to step back into the gilded age. The Garden was part of the original Mellon Estate and served as their "back yard". The plantings - many of which are original hardscapes - feature flowering trees, shrubs, and perennials. The Garden's Japanese Stewarita tree is not native to our area.

The Walled Garden can be rented for events and weddings through the Department of Public Works: [Reserve a Park Shelter](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Recreation-Events/Park-Permits/Reserve-Park-Shelter)
