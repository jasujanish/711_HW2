# Continuing Support for Immigration Issues

_April 18, 2025_

Dear Members of the Carnegie Mellon Community:

Carnegie Mellon University is deeply enriched by its vibrant global community. It is a place where diversity of thought, background and experience fuels our innovation and advances our mission to have a transformative impact on society. We recognize that recent student visa issues have created significant challenges, uncertainty and fear, and we want to reaffirm our unwavering support for all CMU students, faculty and staff, including those in our international community. Following our [previous communication](https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/the-provost/campus-comms/04-07-25), we are writing today to share updates and reinforce resources available to you.

**Ongoing Engagement and Advocacy Efforts**

The Office of International Education (OIE) is actively monitoring this situation and is in direct contact with all affected students to offer immediate support and provide them with information about available legal resources.

President Jahanian and the university's leadership team are working with the American Association of Universities (AAU), peer institutions, and partners to urge elected officials at all levels of government to advocate for due process and recognize the vital contributions of international students to our intellectual community.

**Federal Transition Webpage**

A [Federal Transition webpage](https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/federal-transition) was created to serve as a central resource for the CMU community, offering updates, guidance and tools to navigate changing federal policies and priorities related to immigration, research and support for all members of our community. We invite you to access this page regularly to stay informed and engaged. Updates will also be highlighted each week in a special section of The Piper.

**International Student Academic Case Committee**

As of today, we are aware that five current CMU students have had their visas revoked and Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records terminated. To support these students, we have established the International Student Academic Case Committee, led by Vice Provost for Education Kate Barraclough. The committee will work with affected students and their programs to develop educational continuity plans for the remainder of their academic journey at CMU. We are strongly committed to these students’ academic success, and our goal is for them to complete their degrees with as little disruption as possible.

**Resources Regarding Immigration Concerns**

The [Office of International Education (OIE)](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/index.html) remains a key resource and regularly communicates with international students and scholars about visa matters, including offering [guidance on international travel](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/news-and-events/2024-2025/april/international-travel-considerations.html). Additionally, OIE’s [FAQs on U.S. Immigration (ICE) Enforcement](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/faq/ice-guidance.html) provide crucial information on your rights regarding federal law enforcement agencies and immigration laws. If you have questions about your immigration status, please reach out to OIE directly.

Individuals in urgent need of support, such as those being denied border entry, can call staff from Student Affairs and OIE 24/7. To reach someone outside of regular business hours, contact the CMU Police Department at 412-268-2323 to be connected with the appropriate on-call staff.

To clarify any concerns, we want to assure you that we are not aware of any recent presence of immigration authorities on our campus. The recent presence of workers from the Industrial Commercial Elevator company (also known as ICE) on campus for routine maintenance may have led to a misunderstanding regarding immigration officials in CMU buildings.

**Upcoming In-Person Sessions with Klasko Immigration Law Partners**

We are working with Klasko Immigration Law Partners to offer the following:

- [Open Forum on Immigration Policies](https://www.givecampus.com/schools/CarnegieMellonUniversity/events/open-forum-on-immigration-policies): Monday, April 21, 6:30-7:30 p.m. ET, Rangos 2 and 3, Cohon University Center
- [One-on-One Consultations](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/AcZssZ1q219xurMwpKxwPQ1yDwgYjtrMQH1ENc659BA=): Tuesday, April 22, 15-minute consultations with Klasko attorneys for CMU students, faculty, and staff seeking information on travel-related legal matters. _Note: These sessions are currently at capacity, so OIE is offering a “drop-in” opportunity for an initial consultation with OIE advisors and referral to legal counsel if needed._

Registration is required for both events to ensure they remain exclusive to members of our CMU community and to plan effectively for capacity. Linda Gentile, executive director of the OIE, has connected with the leadership of our Silicon Valley, Washington, D.C., and New York programs to ensure they have the necessary resources and guidance to navigate these matters.

**Well-Being Support Resources**

Recognizing the emotional and mental toll of these circumstances, we want to underscore that no one needs to navigate this situation alone.

- For **students seeking assistance**, Student Affairs provides a variety of [Student Support and Resources](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/resources/index.html). To find the specific support you need, simply reach out through the [CMU Cares Form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?CarnegieMellonUniv&layout_id=14).
- **Faculty and staff** have access to valuable support programs, including the [Employee Assistance Program](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/work-life/support/eap/index.html), which offers confidential counseling and legal resources at no cost.
- We also encourage **everyone in our university community** to explore the many free initiatives available through our [Wellness and Meaning-Making Programs](https://www.cmu.edu/wellbeing/resources/wellness-initiatives/wellness-initiatives.html).

On behalf of our entire leadership team, please know that we remain committed to supporting our international community members and preserving the inclusive, global character of our university.

Sincerely,

James H. Garrett Jr.

Provost and Chief Academic Officer

Gina Casalegno

Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students
