> “Usually, I don’t do things that’s targeted toward us ‘older’ folks…because they make me feel old. But these classes have been different…you’ve developed a program that changes every week. This is keeping us engaged in a dynamic way that is utilizing a different creative skill, a different coordination level, probably different parts of our brains that I think is extremely useful to those of us who are over 55.”—MindfulMuseum participant, 2023

Experience something new each Wednesday at Carnegie Museum of Art! Expand your mind and refresh your body with chair yoga, drawing and art-making, 30-minute guided tours through the galleries, meditations, art history classes, and online offerings. New this year are special sessions with guest senior artists and classes led by museum curators! Each Wednesday is designed for you to choose your path for learning, connecting, or just spending time surrounded by art. This initiative is designed for new and returning museum visitors age 55+ are welcome.

On Wednesdays, Mindful Museum participants receive early entry into Carnegie Museum of Art at 9 a.m., discounted coffee and a pastry at Café Carnegie, and $5 parking. Weekly emails and printed schedules will keep you up to date with specific weekly offerings. A one-time registration fee grants unlimited participation in all Mindful Museum experiences.
