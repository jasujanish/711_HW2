# The Provost

## Office of the Provost and Chief Academic Officer

As the university's chief academic officer, the provost has broad responsibility for leading CMU's schools, institutes and campuses and is instrumental in long-range institutional and academic planning and implementation. The provost also oversees academic and budgetary policy and priorities, ensures the quality of the student body and maintains educational excellence. In addition, the provost has oversight responsibility for recruiting, hiring and advancement of faculty and academic administrators and for the university's promotion and tenure of the 1,500 members of CMU's faculty.

Supporting these efforts and initiatives is an extraordinary group of academic and administrative leaders, including deans, vice provosts and key faculty and professional staff who are committed to continuing CMU's success and tradition in education, research and societal impact.

## Provost Priorities

The university's strategic plan is the foundation for the provost's priorities, which were derived, reinforced and prioritized through ongoing listening sessions with the Carnegie Mellon community. These seven areas of focus aim to strengthen the pillars of our institution. From student success and experience to inclusive excellence, our goal is to create a more holistically supportive and welcoming environment for the campus community.
