# New Kara Walker Exhibit at The Frick Museum Brings to Light Experiences Often Left Out in Historical Archives

On display at The Frick Museum, this moving collection of historical representations is a must-visit while it's in town.

Comprised of 15 large scale prints, Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated) revisits the historical representations found in the two-volume anthology published in 1866, "Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War." Walker overlays enlargements of woodcut plates with her black silkscreen cutout figures in solid black silhouette. In doing so, Walker brings to light experiences of racism that were often omitted or merely hinted at in traditional historical narratives.

> Kara Walker is her generation’s Andy Warhol…There’s nothing more Warholian than a superficial gloss that disguises great depths of meaning.
