# LGBTQIA+ Housing Rights Research

PghCHR signed a contract with queer, trans-led research firm Outwith Studio to look into what housing discrimination looks like in Pittsburgh for our LGBTQIA+ communities. Despite protecting sexual orientation since 1990 and gender identity and expression since 2014, the Commission sees very few complaints filed on these bases. Outwith Studio did outreach, interviews, and a survey to find out what kind of housing discrimination LGBTQIA+ people in Pittsburgh see most frequently and how it manifests, to do outreach better and serve these communities in our mission to prevent and address discrimination in Pittsburgh.

![At some point, 18% of all survey respondents had dealt with housing insecurity through informal means. For those respondents addressing their acute housing insecurity through informal means: • 92% of that group had crashed with friends, family, or acquaintances, • 33% have slept in a car, • 25% have slept outside, • 42% have traded sexual favors for a place to stay, and • 33% have traded other goods or services for a place to stay](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/images/chr-resources/housing-insecurity.png?w=1010&h=725)

![Potential actions include: • Strengthening relationships between existing organizations (including Pittsburgh CHR) and members of LGBTQIA+ communities; • Iterating on and improving communication pathways from local government to LGBTQIA+ communities; • Maintaining and distributing a list of housing providers who have demonstrated commitment to inclusive and anti-discriminatory services; • Creating a method to report and track suspected discrimination without initiating investigations; • Continuing to educate landlords (including public and affordable housing landlords), agents/brokers, housing finance professionals; • Supporting informal care/housing networks (with funding and resources), especially housing providers that are “by and for” the community; • Increasing pairs-testing capacity](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/images/chr-resources/potential-actions.png?w=1078&h=734)
