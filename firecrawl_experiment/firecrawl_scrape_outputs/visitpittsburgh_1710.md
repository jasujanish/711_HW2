## What's a Fish Fry?

If you're not sure why fish on Friday is a thing, let me backup a bit. Lent (Mar. 5 - April 17, 2025), is a religious observance by many Christian denominations that covers a period of approximately six weeks before Easter Sunday. During all of the Fridays of Lent, Catholics over the age of 14 abstain from meat and from foods made with meat.

The end result? Places from churches to fire halls, restaurants and bars get in on the Fish Fry fun, offering up colossal fish sandwiches, Only in Pittsburgh pierogies, traditional Polish favorites like haluski and lots of mac-n-cheese, fries and other fried goodies. You don't need to be a member of the church to go, either; just head on in (bring cash) and experience the Pittsburgh Fish Fry for yourself! Home to a thriving [culinary scene](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/restaurants-culinary/) across various [neighborhoods](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/), you'll find a scrumptious array of fried fish offerings throughout Pittsburgh.

## South

### [The Pub Chip Shop](http://www.thepubchipshop.com/), South Side

[_1830 E Carson Street_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ujPojn9r28Fe7Xh87)

The fish and chips is excellent. Their hand battered haddock is moist, flaky and has the perfect texture. Get it with their crispy chips and tartar sauce.

### [Piper's Pub](https://www.piperspub.com/), South Side

[_1828 E Carson Street_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7zT3woCGbAcZWUKw5)

Experience generous portions of fish and chips with the perfect crunch. In Piper's Pub, haddock is prepared with a beer batter and chips are accompanied by a side of mushy peas.

Don’t miss the special Family Fish Fry Party on March 14, from 4:00 to 7:00pm at Piper’s Pub. Children and families attending will enjoy kids crafts, activities, and more whilst their parents are welcome to enjoy a pint or two or more! Proceeds benefit South Side Kids’ community work.

### [Community Kitchen Pittsburgh](http://www.ckpgh.org/), Hazelwood

[_107 Flowers Avenue_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tpEMesXbg4h2dpZx9)

Constantly voted as one of the top Fish Fry locales in the region, and for good reason. Hand-battered fish along with many sides, homemade by culinary trainees, including pierogies, mac & cheese, haluski and coleslaw.

**Insider Tip:** This was the first fish fry I went to in 2023 for good reason. The fried fish is hand-seasoned and hand-battered to order and even the french fries are fresh cut. This fish fry is a MUST.

### [St. Joan of Arc Church](http://sclpgh.org/fish-fry), South Park

[_6470 Library Road_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qUYCYhvtGp4mSTNj7)

Dine-in returns (takeout also available) for this Pittsburgh-favorite fry offering various fried and baked options including fried or baked fish, homemade crab cakes, shrimp dinner, mac & cheese, pierogies, desserts and more!

## East

### [Big Jim’s Restaurant & Bar](http://www.bigjimsrestaurant.com/), Greenfield

[_201 Saline Street_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/whgodd73gPKbduhWA)

An off-the-beaten-path bar that’s not fancy but their food is great. Big portions and good service. They were featured on Food Network’s "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives." The atmosphere and location are part of the whole experience. A must-stop, simple as that.

### [Swissvale Fire Department](http://www.swissvalefire.org/), Swissvale

[_7400 Irvine Street_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gg4aMyiDYrC5ADnL6)

Beer-battered fish sandwich is tasty and hearty. The mac & cheese is good and the haluski usually sells out quickly so get there early.

### [Stinky’s](http://www.stinkysbarandgrill.com/), Lawrenceville

[_4901 Hatfield Street_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FC6F7fF89tmuYAei9)

The Codfather is the stunner here, a huge filet of cod dipped in beer batter and perfectly fried, all on large kaiser roll. It gets crowded on Fridays during Lent, so go early or later in the evening.

### [E-Town Bar and Grill](http://www.facebook.com/E-Town-Bar-and-Grille-231636288090), Etna

[_304 Butler Street_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KZhsedunWGTK1uELA)

Tucked into a stretch of row houses along Butler Street, E-Town has a great beer selection and terrific food, including flavorful fish sandwiches. Etna's best-kept secret has definitely gotten out.

## West

### [Elly's](http://www.ellyscarnegie.com/), Carnegie

[_1201 Washington Avenue_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t9vgt3mcRHuQ2qvn7)

Jumbo fried fish sandwich AND jumbo fried fish - need we say more? If you get the jumbo it will feed two people. Enjoy it with french fries and coleslaw.

### [St. Margaret of Scotland](http://www.stmargparish.org/), Green Tree

[_310 Mansfield Avenue_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YHxK5KWc2FKX2UieA)

One parish, two amazing fish fries at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church or Ss. Simon and Jude Church in Green Tree. Secret recipe crab cakes and fish tacos are great orders here, along with Friday's famous bread pudding for dessert.

## Strip District

### [Robert Wholey & Co., Inc.](http://wholey.com/)

[_1711 Penn Avenue_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p6zLQ17pVi39srBx7)

Us natives just call it Wholey's (pronounced wool-ees)! Fish of every kind imaginable including incredible melt-in-your-mouth, buttery fish sandwiches. Try the Wholey Holy Moley (1 pound of Icelandic cod stacked on a sandwich) or Wholey Whaler (with 1 lb. of whiting).

### [Cellar on Penn](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/cellar-on-penn/)

[_2031 Penn Avenue_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8g262p9P8whhdxeR8)

If you want the authentic church fish fry experience, Cellar on Penn works with St. Stanislaus Kosta Parish each Friday of Lent for the classic fish sandwich, but you'll also want to try their capellini pasta with crabmeat vodka sauce and famous St. StanisSLAW.

### [Penn Avenue Fish Company](http://pennavefishcompany.com/)

[_2208 Penn Avenue_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BKnUyX5oh1Znt4uT8)

Super casual, loft-like, vibrant restaurant for sampling sushi and daily catches. It’s a great place to get fresh and delicious fish.

### [Primanti Bros.](http://primantibros.com/)

Primanti's famous coleslaw and fries piled atop their colossal fish and cheese is a match made in heaven. Get every flavor of the Pittsburgh fish fry in one bite, available here and at all Primanti locations.

### [Mullaney's Harp and Fiddle Irish Pub](https://harpandfiddle.com/)

[_2329 Penn Avenue_](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mrgNrFEnTLdj1ycg7)

This charming Irish pub provides an array of whiskey to enhance your fried fish experience. The fish and chips are lightly seasoned in a Guinness batter, revealing a burst of hearty flavors in each bite.
