**Pittsburgh, PA –** It’s time to lace up your skates for the return of a fun holiday event. The City of Pittsburgh and CitiParks will hold their annual SKATE with SANTA on Sunday, December 15, 2024 during the 1:30-3pm skating session.

“We are thrilled to have the rink up and running for the 2024-25 season after being closed last year for the installation of our state-of-the-art new chiller system.  And our excitement builds as we get closer to our first skating event of the year—SKATE with SANTA,” said Kathryn Vargas, CitiParks Director.

Residents will have the chance to take to the ice with Santa Claus, a couple of days before Christmas and capture some holiday memories on ice. The festivities will include holiday music and the chance to skate outdoors with SANTA.

Tickets are available on-line only for this event.  Secure your spot to SKATE with SANTA [HERE](https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FSKATEwSANTA/1/01010193b6f6faf1-776a2ea9-a210-4df7-9b45-8dfbaa8b16f3-000000/pkU-iO_hdvVugylNN1fnsubMskBObGVICJECuwxUoXU=383).  ( [https://bit.ly/SKATEwSANTA](https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FSKATEwSANTA/2/01010193b6f6faf1-776a2ea9-a210-4df7-9b45-8dfbaa8b16f3-000000/4XnIQLULG8FMJlTWP8qFsn_qgmO64aSQKwCgzS0_CPI=383))
