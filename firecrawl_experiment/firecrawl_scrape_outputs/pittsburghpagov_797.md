**Basis for Review**

PLI is legally obligated to review each application for compliance with code compliance based on the information provided on the submitted drawings.  Please refer to [building standard and codes](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/Buildings-Standards-Codes) for additional information regarding applicable codes.

PLI has developed [review checklists](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/Applications-Forms/Checklists) that are used to evaluate each application type.  Please review these checklists to confirm you have provided adequate information and demonstrated code compliance.

Please note your permit scope may require review and approval by other agencies, please see Other Agency Coordination for an overview of these requirements and processes.

**Application Response**

If the application requires OneStopPGH review, the applicant will be notified of permit approval or to request revisions either through the OneStopPGH portal or directly by email or fax – if submitted to the OneStopPGH counter.

**Revisions Requested**

PLI’s request for revisions will include a formal plan review record providing a list of comments and/or corrections required for your application to be approved.  The report will identify code references for the requested items.  Please review these code references to better understand why corrections are required and what needs to be corrected.

**Submissions**

Please note that application submissions, including revisions, will only be accepted electronically through the OneStopPGH portal or in hard copy format through the OneStopPGH counter.

**Application Abandonment**

Please note that PLI will consider your application abandoned and void if either of the following applies:

- If no response is made to a request for revisions within 180 days
- If an approved permit is not paid for and issued within 180 days

All application materials associated with abandoned permits will be discarded.

**Next Steps**
