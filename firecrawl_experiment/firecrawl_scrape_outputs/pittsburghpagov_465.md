# Executive Order Directing City Agencies to Consider Workplace Reforms

Published on September 28, 2018

**Pittsburgh, PA** (September 28, 2018) Mayor William Peduto today issued an Executive Order directing all City authorities to consider 17 workforce improvements his administration has advanced for city employees and residents.

“Our government is doing its part to make Pittsburgh a better place to live and work, and to set an example for innovative and supportive workplaces across the region. I urge the authorities affiliated with the City – and the people working for them every day to deliver services to city residents – to continue their efforts to implement these policies,” Mayor Peduto said.

The Order asks the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Water & Sewer Authority and Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh to consider adopting workforce policies, legislation and Executive Orders implemented by Mayor Peduto and Pittsburgh City Council.

The Mayor nominates the board members to all four authorities.

The workplace improvements are:

- $15 Minimum Wage for Employees of City Contractors
