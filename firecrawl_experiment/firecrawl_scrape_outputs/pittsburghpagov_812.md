# Plan Review Meeting

PLI offers the opportunity for applicants and Design Professionals to meet with our staff before submitting permit applications for a project. A Preliminary Plan Review Meeting is not a requirement for permit review and/or issuance. This service is intended to help applicants navigate the permit process for complex projects, code interpretations, or process questions.

For a full breakdown of expectations, requirements, and process see PLI's Preliminary Plan Review Meeting bulletin.

The calculator below provides an easy way to calculate your Preliminary Plan Review Meeting fee. This fee only covers the Preliminary Plan Review Meeting, and does not include any subsequent fees for required permits. Please see our Fee Schedule Page for the most up-to-date PLI Fee Schedule, Fee definitions, information on how to calculate your value of construction, and more.
