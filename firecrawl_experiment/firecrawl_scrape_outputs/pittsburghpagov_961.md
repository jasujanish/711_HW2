## Reports

[**Economic Impact Study: “Estimated Total Economic Impact and Direct Tax Revenue Generation of Different Potential Waterfront Uses” – December 2017**(PDF, 325KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/documents/riverfront-zoning_docs-amp-presentations/estimated-total-economic-impact-and-direct-tax-revenue-generation-2017-09-07.pdf)

A comparison of the direct spending, employment opportunities, economic impacts and tax revenues generated by different potential uses along Pittsburgh’s waterfronts using 13 generalized business categories.

[**Zoning Recommendations Report – September 2017**(PDF, 3MB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/documents/riverfront-zoning_docs-amp-presentations/pittsburgh-zoning-recommendations-report_final6.pdf)

The Zoning Recommendations Report builds upon the earlier work discussed in the Assessment Report (April 2017), as well as numerous interactions with stakeholders. It outlines preliminary approaches and recommendations for a new Riverfront Zoning District.

[**Assessment Report – April 2017**(PDF, 15MB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/documents/riverfront-zoning_docs-amp-presentations/assessment-report_042017.pdf)

The Assessment Report is the first step toward determining what zoning approach is best to create a permanent riverfront zoning district for the City of Pittsburgh. It presents an understanding of the existing conditions and the various concerns – the existing land use and zoning patterns along the three rivers, obstacles to physical and visual access to the rivers, the City’s previously adopted policies and goals for the riverfront, and current stakeholder input on key issues to determine a general course of action.
