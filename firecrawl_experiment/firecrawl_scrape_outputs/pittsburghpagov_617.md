| Pittsburgh Celebrates Centennial of Women's Suffrage | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 8, 2020) Mayor William Peduto has begun the celebration of the Centennial of Women’s Suffrage with an eye towards highlighting the many Pittsburgh women who took on the cause and reached what had for decades seemed an impossible goal.<br>Rarely acknowledged for their integral part in the struggle for the vote, a feisty contingent of Pittsburgh women used their intelligence, wits and endurance to mount a fierce campaign against forces that employed all their might to deny them the vote.<br>Over and over again, Pittsburgh suffragists rose to the challenges, like bright, glittering stars in the suffrage movement. Of particular note, Pennsylvania legislators were won over to the suffragists’ cause in no small measure due to the Pittsburgh Plan.<br>**Yes, the _Pittsburgh Plan._**<br>It was a brilliant strategy conceived by Pittsburgh’s own Jennie Bradley Roessing, and implemented with the help of western PA suffragists and their active network across the Commonwealth. As the plan’s impact grew, states across the nation adopted it.<br>Some of the women were wealthy, some of modest means; part of the group was educated, others were barely literate; they were a diverse bunch, white and black women; Christian and Jewish women. These women hadn’t been raised to be:<br>- leaders speaking in front of hundreds of strangers<br>- fund raisers calling on wealthy, potential donors to ask for donations<br>- activists meeting with legislators, senators and governors<br>- strategists and communicators engaging and maintaining momentum among thousands, across Pennsylvania, without the benefit of today’s communication tools<br>**But they did it.**<br>The following are a starting point, please explore more about Pittsburgh’s remarkable suffragists throughout this year.<br>**City website**:<br>Pittsburgh’s Women’s Suffrage Centennial:  [https://pittsburghpa.gov/womens-suffrage/index.html#current](https://pittsburghpa.gov/womens-suffrage/index.html#current)<br>**Notable Pittsburgh Women video series:**<br>Jennie Roessing, Suffragist Leader:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcfNXXTwfVU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcfNXXTwfVU)<br>African American Suffragists: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w7lnhgjfGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w7lnhgjfGs)<br>Suffragist Events: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQ4k7i2eaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMQ4k7i2eaY)<br>_Contact:_<br>_Gloria Forouzan, 412.255.2632 / [gloria.forouzan@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:gloria.forouzan@pittsburghpa.gov)_ | 8/1/2020 12:53:33 |

| URA Adopting Small Business Line of Credit Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 14, 2020) The board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh will vote Thursday on establishing a $150,000 program at the Hill District Federal Credit Union providing lines of credit to women and minority-owned small businesses.<br>The URA has several efforts to assist such small businesses including the Micro Enterprise Fund loan program, M/WBE programs services, Catapult, the Riverside Center for Innovation’s Diversity Business Resource Center BizFit Program, and the Credit Building program in partnership with Axiom. All these efforts serve in part to support the financial, technical assistance, and professional capacity building needs of small M/WBE businesses.    <br>It is clear small businesses could also benefit from affordable lines of credit. Capital access is a critical piece of sound cash flow management for small contractors as they take on work — to have the necessary upfront cash to hire and source materials and equipment as new jobs.<br>The Hill District Federal Credit Union has long worked with private lenders and others to operate business line of credit programs. The new program would initially allow for 14-28 new lines of credit with opportunity to grow as repayments revolve. The minimum line will be $5,000 up to $10,000.<br>This authorization will allow the URA to make a non-member deposit in the Hill District Federal Credit Union to fund a small business line of credit program. The deposit will be used as a guarantee against the lines of credit. Lines of credit will be approved or declined based on the lending guidelines of the Hill District Federal Credit Union. | 14/1/2020 13:11:43 |

| URA Board to Vote on Funding for North Side Affordable Housing and Hill District Art Gallery | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 16, 2020) The board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh is set to vote today on funding for affordable housing on the North Side and improvements to a Hill District small business. <br>The URA is set to vote on $1.4 million in loans from the Housing Opportunity Fund Rental Gap Program and the Rental Housing Development Program to fund renovations to 70 units across the California-Kirkbride, Central Northside, and Perry South neighborhoods.  <br>North Side Associates (NSA) previously owned 324 units located in 239 separate buildings across the North Side. The units, which are a mix of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-bedroom apartments, were originally built between 1870 and 1910. To date, 197 of the units have been sold to affiliated entities in two phased developments  (Phase I containing 75 units is completed, and Phase II containing 122 units closed in August 2019 and is under construction). These loans will support the third phase of renovations. <br>The URA board is also set to offer a $72,000 loan to the MOKA art gallery in the Hill District to cover renovations of the gallery. It houses a first floor commercial gallery/education/community space, second floor arts studio, 3rd floor apartments for artists in residence, and a 4th floor apartment. The loan has a 10-year term with 2% annual interest. | 16/1/2020 09:32:29 |

| Mayor Peduto Welcomes Latest Lead Testing Results from PWSA | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 28, 2020) Years of management and operational changes at the Pittsburgh Water & Sewer Authority are leading to remarkably positive changes at the agency, including its lowest levels of lead testing results in almost two years. <br>PWSA announced Friday that lead compliance testing for the second half of 2019 showed a lead level of 10 parts per billion (ppb), which is below the action level of 15 ppb set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The findings are the first to fully show the success of PWSA’s additions of orthophosphate into the water system starting in April 2019, as well as other lead-fighting initiatives by the agency’s Community Lead Response program. <br>Through the program PWSA has replaced more than 6,000 lead lines, including 3,000 in 2019, and plans for replacing another 3,000 this year. Much of the replacement work is financed by $49 million from the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST), which Mayor William Peduto and Governor Tom Wolf announced in 2018. <br>Other changes at PWSA have included a new cooperation agreement with the City ensuring the water system will remain publicly-owned; oversight by the state’s Public Utility Commission; and work by the Mayor’s Blue Ribbon Panel on the authority, which forwarded its restructuring recommendations in 2017. <br>“Pittsburgh’s greatest resource has long been its water, and PWSA has proven it is more committed than ever to preserving safe and clean water for generations of city residents to come,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Prior to Friday’s lead compliance results previous testing over the past four years has shown:<br>- June 2016: 22 ppb <br>- December 2016: 18 ppb <br>- June 2017: 15 ppb <br>- December 2017: 21 ppb <br>- June 2018: 10 ppb <br>- December 2018: 20 ppb <br>- June 2019: 17.52 ppb | 28/1/2020 10:35:13 |

From calling 911, to knowing how to perform chest compressions or how to use a tourniquet, to clearing a path for emergency professionals, even the most basic education can save lives and improve outcomes in the critical minutes before first responders arrive. [Minutes Matter,](https://minutesmatter.upmc.com/) a new partnership between [UPMC](https://www.upmc.com/) and the [City of Pittsburgh](https://pittsburghpa.gov/), provides community members access to basic emergency information and education about life-saving interventions. <br>At the scene of most accidents, health emergencies, natural disasters or other crises, bystanders are usually the first people on the scene until trained emergency professionals arrive. Learning simple, easy-to-understand emergency skills empowers bystanders to provide critical help during these life-threatening and highly stressful situations.<br>“Pittsburgh has long been a leader in public health matters, largely due to the partnerships we have long had with leading institutions like UPMC. Minutes Matter takes this one step further by reaching out to our city’s greatest resource – our residents,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>This effort, launching February 2, will drive awareness around critical emergency information and live-saving interventions, directing people to [https://minutesmatterpgh.com](https://minutesmatter.upmc.com/). From cardiac events to bleeding to overdoses, the information provided will help people be more prepared in an emergency, as well as help them to better understand the various ways in which their actions could make a difference. For those who want to go beyond basic education, the effort will also include a calendar of local trainings and events, and the ability for community organizations to submit their events to be added. Other partners in this initiative include the [Pittsburgh Penguins](https://www.nhl.com/penguins) and [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.steelers.com/). <br>“At the onset of many emergencies, some simple actions by those nearby make all the difference, allowing EMS and hospital teams to help those in distress. These actions are easy, and we want to empower our friends and neighbors by teaching them how to be that first responder.  We are proud to partner with the City to spread this important ability. Minutes matter in emergencies, and we believe this partnership will make the difference between life and death,” said [Donald M. Yealy, M.D.](https://www.upmc.com/media/experts/donald-m-yealy), chair of emergency medicine at UPMC. <br>The skills courses and events are open to the public. City of Pittsburgh residency is not required.

| Homewood Pedestrian Improvement Project Debuts | PITTSBURGH, PA (Febrruary 3, 2020)  Mayor William Peduto joined URA Executive Director Greg Flisram, Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker, staff from Representative Ed Gainey’s office and Councilman Reverend Ricky Burgess’s office, key stakeholders, and members of the community for a ribbon cutting ceremony on Friday to celebrate the Homewood Pedestrian Improvement Project. Through this project, $1,089,359 was directly invested into the community.<br>“Homewood is vital to Pittsburgh's future,” Mayor William Peduto said. “The Homewood Pedestrian Improvement Project concentrates investment in the neighborhood's infrastructure, improving quality of life for its residents and visitors.”<br>The goal of the project was to connect Homewood residents to the business district, neighborhood school, and the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway by investing in the pedestrian realm, improving safety and beautifying the neighborhood (The infrastructure priorities were identified in the neighborhood’s Cluster Plan, Safe Routes to School Plan, and Homewood TOD study). <br>Improvements included:<br>- New pedestrian scale lighting, street trees, and street furniture, including benches, trash receptables, and bike racks on Homewood Avenue between the East Busway and Hamilton Avenue<br>- New crosswalks and ADA ramps along pedestrian paths to Faison School and the East Busway<br>- Sidewalk and curb replacement along Tioga Street to ensure pedestrian safety -- Sidewalks in many areas along Tioga Street were completely missing or damaged causing pedestrians to walk in the streets.<br>- Flashing school speed limit signage on Tioga Street<br>- Traffic calming on Finance Street -- Speed humps were installed on Finance Street to discourage speeding, as well as the truck traffic that uses this residential street and school route as a pass-through.<br>Additionally, the project will leverage a planned rehabilitation of the Port Authority of Allegheny County’s Homewood Avenue and Braddock Avenue Bridges.<br>“I want to thank all of our partners for helping to bring this project to fruition,” said URA Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker. “Special commendation to the Homewood residents, particularly those in cluster four. These residents put the pedestrian safety needs of Homewood children first, which will more broadly benefit residents and businesses along the corridor.” <br>The project was a partnership between the Mayor’s Office and the City’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, the URA, Representative Ed Gainey’s Office, Councilman Burgess’s office, Homewood Community Development Collaborative, Port Authority, Operation Better Block, Pittsburgh Community Reinvestment Group, and Pittsburgh Public Schools. Funding was provided by the Transportation Alternatives Program through the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission.<br>**_About the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA)_**<br>_The_ [_URA_](http://www.ura.org/) _is the City of Pittsburgh's economic development agency, supporting the City’s economic development goals, which are designed to create a city of inclusive opportunity for residents, stakeholders, and communities.

| City of Pittsburgh Releases Draft Bike(+) Plan Seeking Safer Streets for All Ages and Abilities | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (February 6, 2020) After five years of planning and input from hundreds of individuals, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure has released the draft Bike(+) Master Plan for public comment.<br>The plan lays out a vision for a safe and connected network of on-street and off street facilities that will enable people of all ages and abilities to travel by bicycle and other small mobility modes to access the needs of daily life including grocery stores, parks, schools and places of employment. The ten-year plan aims to increase safety and access, expand affordable travel choices, and provide attractive alternatives for short-distance vehicle travel to reduce traffic congestion and associated emissions.<br>The city is seeking broad public comment through the end of March. The Draft Plan is available at [www.pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan) and will be posted at multiple open houses throughout the city with more planned for Oakland and the West End (see below). Comment and feedback may also be provided via email to [bikeped@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:bikeped@pittsburghpa.gov) or by calling the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure.<br>Branded the Bike “Plus” Plan, the strategy not only proactively addresses emerging forms of mobility such as pedal-assist electric bicycles, motorized scooter and skateboards, but is additive beyond mobility.<br>“The Bike(+) Plan is safety, plus access, plus sustainability, plus joyful travel,” said Mayor William Peduto. “It is another building block in strengthening an inclusive, vibrant, resilient city providing travel options that accommodate and respect the great diversity and needs of our people.”<br>The plan is a critical step in meeting city climate goals to reduce transportation-related emissions 50% by 2030 while at the same time expanding affordable access to jobs and destinations.<br>“There is a direct correlation between the implementation of safe bicycling facilities and new people riding bikes for transportation," said David White, Executive Director, Pittsburgh Bike Share. "It's exciting to see the City enabling more people to complete short trips by bike safely and comfortably through a connected Bike(+) network."<br>The Draft Bike(+) Plan includes an interconnected street, lane and trail network, facility design guidelines, supportive policies, education and other programs that are reflective of the needs and concerns expressed by the public in the public process leading to plan development.<br>"We are thrilled with the plan and that the City is committing to quickly implement it. Bike friendly streets make it safer and less stressful for everybody to get around, drivers and pedestrians included," said Scott Bricker, executive director of BikePGH.<br>For more information please contact the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure at 412-255-8850.

| URA Board to Vote on Advancing Six Redevelopment Projects on Centre Avenue in Hill District | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 10, 2020) The board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) is expected to vote to advance six of the development teams who responded to the Centre Avenue Request for Qualifications to exclusive negotiations. <br>Exclusive negotiations are the first of three board actions before selling property in the URA’s Disposition Process. During the period, developers work to further their concept, explore financing options, perform necessary site diligence, advance their architectural drawings, and meet with the community. At the end of the exclusive negotiations period, developers are expected to submit a detailed proposal for consideration by the URA.<br>The six development teams being considered include:<br>- Amani Christian CDC is seeking to purchase the former African Queens building and adjacent lots and redevelop the site into ground floor commercial space with upper floor affordable rental units.<br>- MOKA Art Gallery is proposing to purchase the vacant lot behind the art gallery and transform it into a green space for community music and art enjoyment.<br>- Salon XO and Bridging the Gap Development are looking to purchase and redevelop property in two phases: Phase 1 includes the purchase and rehabilitation of an existing structure into a new upscale salon with a spa and wellness center on the first floor and affordable apartments above. Phase 2 includes a new construction mixed-use development. Salon XO was established in 2014 and is currently renting space in the neighborhood.<br>- Studio Volcy, LLC is proposing Rhythm Square, which includes the rehabilitation of the former Contractors Department Store building, located at 2225 Centre Avenue, and the Center Builders Supply Building, located at 2237 Centre Avenue, as well as the vacant land in between.  The mixed-use development will include gallery space, micro-restaurants, live-work space, and affordable housing units.<br>- The Sankofa Group, Inc. plans to develop the vacant land to the east of the Thelma Lovette YMCA in two phases: Sankofa Square, a three-story commercial structure and parking lot and Sankofa Estates: an 8-12 unit mixed-income, multi-family development.<br>- Thomas Boyd is seeking to purchase and redevelop the former Hamm’s Barbershop building and adjacent lots located at the corner of Centre Avenue and Kirkpatrick Street. Mr. Boyd has operated Big Tom’s Barbershop in the Hill District for 14 years and has been renting in his current location all this time. Mr. Boyd proposes to rehabilitate the first floor and relocate his existing business to that building. The upper two floors are tentatively scheduled to be renovated as two, 2-bedroom apartments that would be marketed as affordable. The adjacent lots would be used for outdoor deck/lounge space that would be utilized by the community at times and at other times be utilized by neighborhood home-based businesses for pop-up sales and demonstrations.<br>The six proposals represent a total of 55 parcels; 54 are URA-owned and one is City-owned. <br>Prior to the release of the RFQ, the Equitable Empowerment Fund (EEF) was created. The EEF is a new tool designed to provide funding for technical assistance through a local nonprofit partner, Neighborhood Allies. With EEF, respondents could receive assistance with RFQ language/packet development, budget and proforma development, and feasibility analysis to ensure that the vision for the parcel is feasible and fits within the community plan. The creation of this tool helped lower barriers and encouraged small businesses, local businesses, and small developers to respond and participate. <br>"When the URA announced the plan to begin working with the neighborhood to redevelop the Centre Avenue corridor back in March 2018, we heard from a host of community stakeholders and community partners that our process needed to be modified to ensure existing business owners, non-profits, and Hill District cultural institutions could participate and ensure community ownership,” said Diamonte Walker, Deputy Executive Director of the URA.<br>“It became abundantly clear that we needed to take a different approach, which resulted in a modified request for proposals. As a result, I am thrilled that of the eleven proposals received, all development teams were either minority or woman owned and/or a Hill District non-profit or cultural institution. There is considerable work to be done, but we look forward to supporting these fantastic development teams bring the vision of a revitalized corridor to fruition.”  <br>The URA issued an RFQ in July 2019 seeking multiple developers to participate in the revitalization of various publicly owned, scattered sites along the Centre Avenue Corridor in the Middle Hill neighborhood of the City of Pittsburgh.  Following the October 22, 2019 deadline, the URA received 11 responses. More information on the Centre Avenue RFQ can be found here. The URA plans to release a second round of the RFQ in March for the remaining parcels.<br>The URA Board of Directors meets at 2 p.m. on Thursday, February 13, 2020, in the Lower Level Conference Room at the URA offices located at 412 Boulevard of the Allies.<br>_Contact:_<br>_Gigi Saladna_<br>_Senior Communications Manager_<br>_Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh_<br>_412.255.6434_<br>_gsaladna@ura.org_ | 10/2/2020 14:58:06 |

| URA Supporting Affordable Housing in Homewood and Garfield/Friendship | PITTSBURGH, PA (Feburary 11, 2020) The URA Board of Directors is set to vote Thursday on affordable housing developments in Homewood South and Garfield/Friendship.<br>The board is expected to vote to enter into loan and grant agreements with Operation Better Block (OBB) for the acquisition and rehabilitation of 627 N. Homewood Avenue, better known as the James T. Givner Building, in the Homewood South neighborhood. The building will contain two retail spaces on the ground floor which will be occupied by two neighborhood-serving businesses. The second and third floors will include six affordable, one-bedroom units. Four of the units will be rented to tenants with incomes at or below 50% of Area Median Income (AMI) and two units will be rented to tenants with incomes at or below 80% AMI. All utilities, with the exception of tenants’ electric, will be paid by the owner.<br>Historically, the Givner Building has been a key component of Homewood's Business District and formerly housed the WURP Radio Station, a barbershop, a dental office, and the Homewood-Brushton Revitalization & Development Corporation offices. The proposed redevelopment will complete the development of the key intersection of North Homewood Avenue and Kelly Street, and anchor a strategic section of the Business District with the creation of the new affordable rental units and commercial spaces.<br>"This building is key to both the history and the future of Homewood, and I'm very happy the URA and Operation Better Block are supporting its rebirth," Mayor William Peduto said.<br>OBB will serve as the borrower, developer, Housing Opportunity Fund (HOF) nonprofit applicant, service provider, and property manager for the project. The complete renovation of the building includes new interior finishes, furnishings, structural supports, and roofing as well as exterior improvements such as door/window modifications, accessibility enhancements, and landscaping of the adjacent lot. The adjoining vacant lot will be used for outdoor seating and/or supportive green space. The total cost of the redevelopment is budgeted at $2,319,085. <br>"The URA has enjoyed working with Jerome Jackson and his team at Operation Better Block. Their hard work and dedication to developing Homewood's business corridor is evident. The redevelopment of the Givner Building will help create a vibrant business corridor while also providing affordable housing options for neighborhood residents," URA Director of Housing Opportunities Jessica Smith Perry said.<br>Loans will be provided from the Housing Opportunity Fund (HOF) Rental Gap Program, the Rental Housing Development and Improvement Program, the Urban Development Action Grant Program Income Fund, and URA Streetface Program; grants will be provided from the Community Development Investment Fund and a URA Department of Community and Economic Development Keystone award.<br>The URA Board will also vote to approve a HOF Rental Gap Program (RGP) loan for $400,000 with Montana Development Corporation (MDC), in partnership with Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation, to provide combined construction/permanent financing for the renovation andpreservation of the Montana Building, a 16-unit affordable building for individuals and families.<br>Located at 5456 Penn Ave. in Garfield/Friendship, the Montana Building consists of eight one-bedroom units, and eight two-bedroom units. All 16 units are occupied by low-income households and rented at affordable rates. The property has operated as an affordable apartment building since 1992 when MDC was incorporated as a nonprofit and purchased and renovated the property. <br>After 28 years, the building needs additional rehabilitation. Most of the needed repairs are exterior, including the fire escapes, roof, masonry, repointing, and repainting. The building interior has been well maintained and units have been updated over the years. Minor interior repairs will be completed as part of the construction contract, including common area electrical, new furnaces, and kitchen cabinets/countertops based on unit needs. <br>The HOF funds being provided will ensure permanent affordability, with four units to be rented to households with incomes at or below 30% AMI and 12 units rented to households with incomes at or below 50% AMI. <br>At its February 6, 2020 meeting, the HOF Advisory board passed a motion to award this project a HOF RGP loan in the amount of $400,000. The HOF RGP is intended to help fund the creation of new affordable housing and/or preserve affordable housing citywide, specifically targeting households at or below 30 % AMI and 50% AMI. <br>**About Operation Better Block (OBB):**<br>Founded in 1970 to overcome neighborhood blight and deterioration, OBB's mission is to strategize, organize and mobilize, block by block, to benefit the Homewood community. This is accomplished through technical and community assistance provided to block associations, fostering youth development, participating in housing development efforts, and encouraging and supporting public and private investments to stimulate economic development in the community. <br>**About Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation (BGC):**<br>The BGC exists to improve the quality of life of the residents of Garfield and the surrounding neighborhoods. It does this through several real estate development and people-focused activities.  <br>_Contact:_<br>_Gigi Saladna_<br>_Senior Communications Manager_<br>_Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh_<br>_412.255.6434_<br>_gsaladna@ura.org_ | 11/2/2020 13:26:25 |
| URA Board Considering Projects in Homewood, Beechview, Lincoln Place and Downtown | Four items relating to development opportunties in Homewood, Beechview, LIncoln Place and Downtown will be presented Thursday to the board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA).<br>The Economic Development Department, in partnership with Camo Customz and Oasis Creative Space, will present the concept design of the Greater Pittsburgh Coliseum re-boarding artwork.<br>- The URA Board awarded the re-boarding contract to Camo Customz and Oasis Creative Space at its December 2019 meeting. The artists worked jointly with Homewood Collaborative to produce a final design. The artists and URA staff attended the January 16, 2020 Homewood Collaborative Meeting and the January 21, 2020 Homewood Community Meeting to show the community the artwork, and it was met with positive feedback. The URA is funding the project with $15,860.<br>The URA will be issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for 1600 Broadway Ave in Beechview, and recently issued an RFP for Commercial Market Analysis in Lincoln Place.<br>- The URA acquired the property located at 1600 Broadway in 2008 through foreclosure. Over the years the URA has worked with multiple developers, but none have been the correct fit for this key structure in Beechview’s business district.  The URA will reissue an RFP seeking developers to purchase and redevelop the site.<br>- The property in Lincoln Place, located at 1201 Mifflin Road, was acquired by the City of Pittsburgh in 2003. Formerly a mobile home park, this approximately 7.19-acre site is now vacant land. The URA is in the process of acquiring the property from the city with the intent of conveying it for redevelopment.  The URA is in the early stages of planning and is seeking proposals from commercial market professionals to help understand the types of businesses and square footages that can be supported by the market in this location. The URA has been working closely with Councilman O’Connor’s Office and the 31st Ward Community Action Group on this redevelopment.<br>Finally, the Board is expected to vote to approve a redevelopment proposal and contract for the sale of 604 Liberty Avenue, Downtown, to Hitchhiker Holdings, LLC for $120,000 plus costs.<br>- 604 Liberty Avenue is an 1,875 square-foot building located next to Liberty News and across from Heinz Hall, with a unique vantage point onto 6th Street and the Roberto Clemente Bridge. The property is located within two blocks of Market Square. Hitchhiker Holdings, LLC is a Pittsburgh-based brewing company currently with two locations: one in Sharpsburg, a 15,000 square-foot tap room that opened in 2017; and one in Mt. Lebanon, a 1,500 square-foot tap room opened in 2014. Hitchhiker Holdings is proposing to redevelop 604 Liberty into a retail taproom for the brewing company. The company also plans to debut nitro-brewed cold coffee during daylight working hours.<br>- Total estimated project costs are $547,500, with cost of improvements to the property estimated at $427,500. In the event Hitchhiker sells the property within 20 years of the URA-Hitchhiker closing, the URA will receive 5% of the sale price. Prior to the sale of this property, the proposed development will again be presented to the URA Board for approval of final working drawings, evidence of financing and authorization to execute the deed.<br>_Contact:_<br>_Gigi Saladna_<br>_Senior Communications Manager_<br>_Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh_<br>_412.255.6434_<br>_gsaladna@ura.org_ | 12/2/2020 14:44:12 |

| Mayor William Peduto Calls for Organizations to Oppose Changes to Federal Community Reinvestment Act Regulations | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 17, 2020) Mayor William Peduto issued a letter today to community organizations, calling on them to submit public comment in opposition to changes to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) that have been proposed by the Trump Administration. Currently, the CRA incentivizes banks and financial institutions to open offices in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and draw investment to those areas. The proposed changes remove these incentives and could eliminate access to capital and ability of these areas to attract investment.<br>“The CRA has been a critical part of the fabric of community development since 1977 and it’s created the opportunity for equity in our neighborhoods. When banks move into low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, other projects move into those neighborhoods because CRA regulations say to the financial institutions ‘You’re a part of this community. You’re a neighbor. You’ll get a higher rating if you prove it by lending fairly and locally so your neighbors can reinvest, revitalize and boost the economy of this area,’” Mayor Peduto explained.<br>“The proposed changes to the CRA threaten the important work that our community-based organizations and community development corporations do to revitalize our neighborhoods. Our neighborhoods will take the hardest hit under these changes, so we’re calling on our partners to speak up and submit their comments,” said Mayor’s Office Deputy Chief of Staff and Chief Equity Officer Majestic Lane.<br>Federal regulatory agencies are obligated to collect public comment for 60 days after a federal regulation change is proposed. Comments on the proposed changes must be submitted by March 9 at: [https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=OCC-2018-0008-1515](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=OCC-2018-0008-1515).<br>The [full text of the letter](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/8563_Community_Leaders_CRA_Letter.pdf) from Mayor Peduto:<br>Dear Community Partner,<br>Your contributions to the strength of our communities is invaluable and we need your help. The Trump Administration is proposing changes that would severely weaken the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). This important civil rights statute was passed in 1977 to combat the segregating process of redlining by lending institutions. The CRA has been integral in promoting the financial health of low-income and moderate-income communities, particularly communities color by requiring banks to meet the credit needs of the local communities where they do business.<br>The regulatory changes proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reduce the ability to effectively evaluate banks in specific areas such as lending, community development investments, and community development services. Furthermore, they incentivize banks to focus more on large capital deals rather than responding to the needs of the local community, fundamentally threatening the original intention of the act. These changes would undermine the spirit of the CRA by refocusing its function to protecting banks, rather than its original intention to protecting financial investment in our most valuable assets – our neighbors and our communities.<br>Per federal requirements the FDIC and OCC are hosting a 60-day open comment period to gather feedback and testimony. To date, the Federal Reserve, which regulates 20 percent of the market and is the third regulatory body required to pass the changes, has refused to sign on to the proposal stating, “Any modernization of the CRA must further the goal at the heart of the statute — encouraging banks to meet the credit needs of local low- and moderate-income communities.” They will be closely reviewing public comment before determining how they will proceed.<br>The City of Pittsburgh has submitted [public comment in opposition to the proposed regulatory changes](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/8562_Letter_to_OCC_CRA.JPG) and are joining cities across the country by signing onto an opposition letter from the United States Conference of Mayors. These changes threaten financial investment and development in our neighborhoods and communities. We hope that our community partners like you will join us by submitting public comments by March 9, 2020 via this site: [https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=OCC-2018-0008-1515](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=OCC-2018-0008-1515).<br>The CRA is critical legislation that should be updated to be stronger and more effective for communities, not gutted for the convenience of financial institutions. Banks must be held accountable in meeting the needs of the communities they serve.<br>Your partnership and community work is the foundation of our neighborhoods’ revitalization. Thank you for sharing the City of Pittsburgh’s commitment to sustaining, growing and strengthening our communities.<br>Sincerely,<br>William Peduto<br>Mayor of Pittsburgh | 17/2/2020 13:32:40 |

| New Opportunity Zones Marketplace To Help Pittsburgh Produce More Equitable Development Projects | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 18, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh are pleased to be part of Smart Growth America’s new National Opportunity Zones Marketplace, intended to equip local governments, real estate developers and investors, and community leaders with the tools needed to work together to make smart, equitable development possible in Opportunity Zones—and beyond.<br>Pittsburgh is one of 13 cities chosen to participate in [Smart Growth America](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/) and LOCUS’ National Opportunity Zones Academy, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Barr Foundation.

| Fourth Avenue, Wood Street to Smithfield Street Closure | The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is extending the full vehicle closure of Fourth Avenue between Wood Street and Smithfield Street.

| New Zoning Legislation to Ease Parking Requirements, Improve Pedestrian Safety and Mobility | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 9, 2020) New legislation from Mayor William Peduto will ease parking requirements in densely built city neighborhoods, which will increase pedestrian safety and lessen reliance on automobiles. <br>The legislation changes city Zoning Code rules for single-family attached dwellings (rowhouses) that currently require them to have parking spaces. The requirement currently forces housing developers and homeowners to make curb cuts into sidewalks to provide parking, which makes walking more cumbersome for pedestrians. <br>“This change will enhance what makes many of our historic neighborhoods so special, and it will encourage more people to walk, help people using baby carriages and wheelchairs to navigate sidewalks, and help residents get to know their city and their neighbors by foot,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Additionally, the change is expected to boost housing affordability by not requiring parking pads and garages to be constructed for new homes; secure the historic nature of older city neighborhoods like Lawrenceville, the Mexican War Streets and the South Side; and help reduce carbon emissions by not requiring spaces for gas-powered vehicles.  <br>The “removal of minimum parking requirements for development of single-family attached dwellings furthers the City’s goals of improving pedestrian safety, enhancing neighborhood walkability, and promoting non-vehicular mobility” the legislation states. <br>The Zoning Code currently requires all Single Unit Attached residences to have at least one off-street parking space per unit. The Mayor’s legislation, which is being introduced to City Council tomorrow, would change that requirement to zero. <br>The change is in line with development goals shared by the Departments of City Planning and Mobility and Infrastructure. | 9/3/2020 09:22:49 |

| Mayor William Peduto Calls for Support for Workers and Small Businesses | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 23, 2020) Mayor William Peduto is working with municipal and labor leaders around the country in support of financial aid for workers, small businesses and cities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>The Mayor issued a letter Friday to the leaders of the state House and Senate in support of American Working Family Relief Action Plan, which would provide vitally needed support for working families and vulnerable populations in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, and is supported by more than forty organizations representing 1 million workers in Pennsylvania. <br>“People, and the small businesses that employ them, are under tremendous stress right now and we need to support them – just as they are supporting us as we deal with this pandemic. It’s time for our federal and state governments to do all they can to step up and deliver significant emergency funding,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>The Mayor also signed onto a letter by the Service Employees International Union to Congress seeking support for workers in the airline industry. “Any economic relief to the airline industry must also protect and invest in the employees of their contractors whose health and livelihood is on the line,” the letter said. <br>Mayor Peduto also joined more than 300 mayors from across the country calling on the federal government to issue $250 billion to municipal governments on the front lines responding to the pandemic. The U.S. Conference of Mayors is leading that drive, and telling Congress the following: <br>“As the spread of COVID-19 continues and demand for our services increases, cities will also experience significant declines in revenues in areas such as tourism and visitor-related hotel and lodging taxes; sales, use and general excise taxes; personal and corporate income taxes; and revenue from utility enterprise accounts, among others. Cities could be hit with additional pension liabilities due to market volatility while, at the same time, having to shoulder the cost of responding to the crisis. Lost revenue from economic contraction will put pressure on the ability to deliver basic services - including police, fire, water, and sewer - or aid business sectors that serve as the foundation of our metro economies.” <br>A copy of the letter to state leaders [is here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9050_Mayor_Peduto_LoS_-_American_Working_Families_Relief_Action_Plan.pdf), a copy of the SEIU letter [is here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9053_9052_Mayors_city_electeds_Contract_Workers_Sign_on_Letter_(1).pdf), and a copy of the USCOM letter to Congressional leaders [is here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9051_Mayors-Supplemental-Request-032020.pdf). | 23/3/2020 11:28:12 |

| Statement on Environmental Services Workers and COVID-19 | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 25, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh is taking all due precautions to protect refuse workers from the Bureau of Environmental Services who were sent home today due to fears over COVID-19 exposure, and has been taking these precautions with all essential City personnel since the start of the pandemic. <br>The City has been following Centers for Disease Control guidance including having Environmental Services buildings and trucks cleaned regularly; providing workers with protective glasses and gloves; and doing daily health screenings. Workers are given gloves each day that they are not allowed to take home, and have been offered plastic gloves to wear under them if they wish. <br>The City has provided Environmental Services workers wipes to regularly clean off their equipment, and the City has encouraged workers to wash their uniforms daily. <br>Every morning workers are given a health care check-list to identify if they have any symptoms of the virus. This check-list has been mischaracterized as a “release form,” which it is not. <br>“Environmental Services workers are on the front lines of the City’s pandemic response and are performing a great public service to their fellow residents. We all need to come together in this time of need, and to continue supporting the personnel – including police, medics, firefighters and others – who are protecting us at this time,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>The wife of a refuse worker had a presumptive positive test result reported yesterday, and the Environmental Services headquarters was cleaned and sanitized last night after the report was registered. The City contacted medical professionals immediately and made sure it was following all CDC protocols. <br>Neither the worker nor his wife is showing symptoms but as a precaution the worker has been placed in self-quarantine, with pay. <br>Additionally, shifts for the refuse workers have been staggered to lower interaction among workers in the main Environmental Services building: they are now beginning work in shifts starting at 5, 6, 7 and 8 a.m. <br>City officials including Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, Public Works Director Mike Gable, Assistant EMS Chief Mark Pinchalk and City Medical Director Dr. Ronald Roth spoke with representatives for the workers today to go over COVID-19 protocols.  <br>Workers were reminded by medical officials that wearing masks was not necessary, and could even help spread the disease if workers were touching their faces while adjusting masks. <br>Officials from the Peduto administration and Teamsters Local 249 are working together to clear up any misunderstandings, and normal service should continue as normal tomorrow.<br>Residents who put their refuse at curbsides today should leave it there, and it will be collected after Thursday's regular pickup routes are completed. [When the City declared a state of emergency](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3737) it was noted that residents may experience delays in refuse pickup, due to expected staffing issues connected to the pandemic. <br>Beginning Monday, the City will suspend pickups of bulk and yard waste to help with staffing.<br>City residents [are reminded of these tips](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/protect-refuse-workers), first issued March 16, to make refuse collection easier and safer for Environmental Services workers: <br>- Help limit exposure to germs by setting trash out for collection in substantial, leak-proof bags tied up and without tears.  <br>- Please stay back 50 feet from refuse and recycling vehicles <br>- Slow down and look for workers before you attempt to go around any truck <br>- Follow the proper set-out guidelines to prevent work-related injury <br>- Do not include any prohibited materials in your curbside trash | 25/3/2020 11:22:10 |

| Commission on Human Relations Statement on Discrimination Targeting Asian Populations | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 26, 2020) As numerous news outlets have been reporting, discrimination against people of Asian descent around the world and in the United States, has been increasing. This rise in discrimination is based on unfounded fear and misinformation surrounding COVID-19. Incidents of such unlawful and inexcusable discrimination include increases in the following: anti-Asian rhetoric, such as calling the novel coronavirus the “Chinese virus;” anti-Chinese social media posts; denial of services; avoiding Asian-owned business; making fraudulent claims to keep people away from Asian-owned business; harassment; vandalism; and physical assaults. While such racism and xenophobia are being fed by new, false beliefs, such behaviors are not new in our country. No matter the reasons, such actions will not be accepted or tolerated in the City of Pittsburgh.<br>Earlier this month it was reported that business was down 40 percent for Asian restaurants before non-essential businesses had to close, according to Marian Lien, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA). PghCHR has also become aware of actions such as people seeking medical treatment for having contact with persons of Asian descent. These actions are not only hurtful to those individuals, but harmful to our community as a whole. Pittsburgh prides itself on having a vibrant international community and we must stand with them during this time of fear and confusion and speak out against racist rhetoric.<br>You can support our international community through the following actions: buy food , supplies, or a gift card from a locally-owned Asian business; volunteer with a local non-profit serving vulnerable groups; reach out virtually to ensure the well-being of neighbors, friends, and colleagues; speak out when you hear racist and xenophobic comments; encourage reporting of discriminatory and hateful actions- even if PghCHR is not able to investigate these claims, we will always provide resources for agencies that may be able to help.<br>The Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations (“PghCHR”) exists to ensure that members of the Pittsburgh community are treated fairly, equitably, and equally. That includes ensuring that people do not have to live in fear of discrimination. PghCHR stands with our racial social justice partners across the U.S. and the Pittsburgh community to denounce all acts of hate and discrimination, including the recent acts of hate and discrimination against Asian persons. We want to assure the Pittsburgh community that, despite the workplace impacts of the novel coronavirus, the PghCHR is continuing to receive inquiries and investigate complaints and remains committed to combating hate and discrimination.<br>As the City’s civil rights law enforcement agency, the PghCHR investigates and resolves complaints of discrimination in employment, public accommodations (such as businesses open to the public), and housing (such as renting or buying), based on membership in a [protected class](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6112_Protected_Classes_Poster_FINAL.pdf).

| City of Pittsburgh Announces More Social Distancing Restrictions | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 30, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh is closing its basketball courts and overlooks to further enforce the social distancing rules necessary to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>While Pittsburgh residents have largely been following directives to stay at least six feet from others to stop the spread of the virus, others have not, especially in City parks. <br>Parks are remaining open, and residents are encouraged to use them to promote physical activity. But beginning today Public Works crews are removing basketball rims from courts, and closing off the Mount Washington overlooks. Those areas were commonly filled over the weekend with residents who were not following social distancing rules. <br>Group sports are not permitted in City parks. In addition to closing basketball courts, Public Safety officials will be monitoring soccer fields and other play areas to make sure social distancing rules are being followed. One soccer field in Riverview Park has already been closed. <br>Playgrounds have already been shut down, but some have continued to let children use them: residents are reminded that park equipment and playgrounds may not be safe, as the COVID-19 virus can live on surfaces for days.  <br>Residents should also maintain social distancing when using park trails, which have been extremely crowded in recent days. <br>Public Safety officials are increasing efforts to encourage responsible behavior. Park Rangers and Police are patrolling parks more closely to provide reminders of proper social distancing, and Public Works is posting more signs to remind park and playground users of closures. <br>Residents are further reminded not to share food with Public Safety and other City personnel. While such offers are clearly being done with the best of intentions to show support for workers in these trying times, the risk of spreading disease among the City workforce is too great, and residents are encouraged to donate to food pantries instead. <br>Staying at home, practicing social distancing when outside and washing hands are important parts of the fight against the global COVID-19 pandemic. By doing their part Pittsburgh residents can help stop the spread of the disease and ease the mounting burden on the hospital workers and Public Safety officials on the front lines fighting for us all. <br>_Contacts:_<br>_Timothy McNulty, Communications Director, [timothy.mcnulty@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:timothy.mcnulty@pittsburghpa.gov)_<br>_Chris Togneri, Public Information Officer, [pio@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:pio@pittsburghpa.gov)_ | 30/3/2020 10:42:45 |

| City Residents Urged to Complete 2020 Census | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 1, 2020) In partnership with Allegheny County and the Complete Count Committee, the City of Pittsburgh is reminding residents that April 1 kicks off Census 2020. <br>Census data is used to decide what money and resources are distributed to neighborhoods, cities and states. The COVID-19 federal stimulus package that was recently passed to provide relief to residents used numbers from the last census to determine how money would be allocated to Pittsburgh. It is critical that every person is counted so that we can get the help the City needs.   <br>“While everyone is staying home and staying safe these days to help stop the spread of COVID-19, there is plenty of time for us all to fill out the Census questionnaire. It’s really easy and takes about five minutes to do,” Mayor William Peduto said. “Given the economic hardships we’re facing as a result of the pandemic it is more important than ever that Pittsburgh is fully counted and in turn fully funded, so we can deliver residents the services they need.” <br>Census notifications were sent out to households in early March with instructions for filling out the questionnaire online. Households can request a paper copy or do the questionnaire over the phone by calling 1-844-330-2020 for English.  A list of numbers for additional languages is included below.  <br>Census Bureau interviewers who go door-to-door will continue this census, but that outreach will be delayed due to COVID-19 concerns. Other Census operational changes due to COVID-19 are available [on their website](https://2020census.gov/en/news-events/operational-adjustments-covid-19.html).  <br>For more information about the Allegheny County and City of Pittsburgh Be Counted 2020 program, including toolkits for organizations to encourage local participation, visit [BeCounted2020.org](http://becounted2020.org/).   <br>Questions or concerns can be directed to contact@becounted2020.org.

| Help the Helpers: City of Pittsburgh, UPMC, Steelers and Penguins Encourage the Community to Keep Helping and Look for New Ways to Help | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 8, 2020) “Help the Helpers,” a joint initiative of the [City of Pittsburgh](https://pittsburghpa.gov/), [UPMC](https://www.upmc.com/), [Pittsburgh Penguins](https://www.nhl.com/penguins) and [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.steelers.com/) encourages the community to recognize and look for ways to support “the helpers” and each other, such as picking up a gallon of milk, offering to walk a dog, or making food for your neighbor. During times of crisis, Pittsburghers remember the advice of Mister Rogers to look for the helpers. <br>“Help the Helpers” invites all to show support to health care workers, as well as grocery clerks, pharmacists, garbage collectors and delivery drivers, all of whom perform essential roles to keep our communities safe. A phone call to a neighbor, a card to an isolated elderly person, an offer to order groceries, donation of protective equipment or handmade face masks, can all contribute to our community caring for each other. Window signs of support, social media frames and sharing personal stories of how we are supporting each other are key to the initiative, and community members are encouraged to share their “helping the helpers” stories with the hashtag “HelpTheHelpers.” Window signs and social frames can be downloaded at [UPMC.com/HelpTheHelpersPGH](https://pages.upmc.com/help-the-helpers-pgh?utm_source=vanity-url&utm_medium=offline&utm_content=help-the-helpers-pgh&utm_campaign=help-the-helpers).<br>“Any gesture of support is welcome, but please be smart about it. The best way to help everyone continues to be staying inside and keeping the virus from spreading,” Mayor William Peduto said. “For the safety of our community, and to lower the likelihood of exposure to or spreading of COVID-19, you should always follow the social distancing and self-isolation recommendations from federal, state and local governments.”<br>“The community response and support to our UPMC staff is extraordinary and heart-warming. Hundreds of caring people and organizations have offered their supplies, their help, their encouragement. Simple actions like these make all the difference, allowing first responders and hospital teams to help those in need of our care. We are grateful for the outpouring of support, which is no surprise from the good people and the good neighbors in all of the communities that we serve,” said [Donald M.

| Mayor William Peduto Addresses Pittsburgh on COVID-19 Pandemic | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 16, 2020) Mayor William Peduto made the following remarks today regarding the City of Pittsburgh's ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic:<br>Good afternoon Pittsburgh.<br>One month ago today we declared a state of emergency and issued an Executive Order limiting public gatherings in response to the coronavirus pandemic here in Western Pennsylvania. Today I want to take a few minutes to say thank you to all of you have been staying home and working successfully to flatten the curve. <br>Once we saw this global pandemic coming our way, we made the tough sacrifices together to do what was necessary to keep our neighbors safe: it started with canceling our beloved St. Patrick’s Day Parade, closing city playgrounds and recreation spaces, committing ourselves to social distancing, and most of all just staying home.  <br>In the times we do go out, we're following Governor Wolf's latest advice to wear masks at all times. <br>It hasn’t been easy but it has saved lives, and it’s no time to stop now. <br>Despite all this, your City government has been in continuous operation. Public safety is responding to emergencies, DPW is collecting refuse, DOMI and PLI are keeping roads and buildings safe, and we’ve provided over 10,000 meals to children and seniors.<br>I can’t thank our amazing workforce enough. They share the same anxieties and pressures other city residents do, but have kept providing the public services their neighbors need. We’ve done our best to keep them safe while performing their critically-needed work, going above CDC standards by providing masks and PPE to our front-line workers, thoroughly cleaning their facilities, and allowing other City employees to work from home. Their services to you will continue through this pandemic and beyond. The City of Pittsburgh does not close.<br>Our work couldn’t be done without the support of private employees throughout the Pittsburgh area. That includes people working in warehouses, trucking, grocery and convenience stores, those cleaning buildings and hospitals, nurses, doctors, hospital workers, bus drivers, pharmacists, restaurant workers and so many more. Many of these workers are in turn protected by our great union partners and I want to thank them too.<br>Our meds-and-eds industry has long been at the heart of Pittsburgh and that continues in the planning and preparation for the coronavirus: as of yesterday there were still 327 available ICU beds in the county, and 835 ventilators. Pittsburgh’s leadership and expertise in this area is something we can be justly proud of. We have not yet experienced a surge that has overwhelmed our medical industry as many other cities have.<br>Employers and others in the corporate and foundation communities deserve our thanks too. That includes the restaurants and other food providers helping us feed our kids and seniors; the universities working tirelessly on cutting-edge research; and the foundations doing all they can to plug holes in our social safety net.<br>Those holes, however, are daunting and our critical communities are facing pain and hardship beyond what most of us are facing at home.<br>We are working with Allegheny County to protect our homeless residents, by installing handwashing stations and potable water in encampments, and by securing hotel rooms in the event such residents develop COVID-19 symptoms.<br>We recognize the emotional impact the pandemic is having on everyone, and is especially being felt disproportionately by communities that have long experienced trauma. Don't be afraid to ask for help — we're here for you.<br>We are working with nonprofit partners to make sure we are reaching new Americans, both documented and undocumented, to get them the health care and financial support they need. We are working with police and nonprofits to address rising cases of domestic violence. We are working too on the rise of drug overdoses, and have expanded the practice of leaving behind life-saving Narcan.<br>While working on these daily matters my administration continues to plan for what happens next, when medical experts give us the go-ahead to slowly return to our normal lives. <br>For city government that means continuing to approve zoning permits to allow construction and neighborhood development projects to hit the ground running when it’s safe; working to allow swimming pools to reopen safely at some point this summer; working with employers to provide youth with summer jobs through our Learn and Earn program; and continuing to offer meals for those who are hungry.<br>Our friends at the URA continue to work to provide help for small businesses, despite diminishing resources, and have reported huge calls for help from minority and women owned businesses. <br>It has made 79 loan approvals (54 of them to minority and women owned businesses) worth $1.1 million, and has another 281 loan requests (211 of the from minority and women owned businesses) worth $3.7 million, and is searching continously for further funding to grant them.<br>The URA is also overseeing city rental assistance to those in need, helping 52 homeowners so far with their rent and another 200 relief requests still in process. I can’t thank enough those members of City Council who joined with me in 2017 to approve the Housing Opportunity Fund, which is paying for the rental help.<br>The planning for our new future includes coming to terms with dark days ahead for the City’s budget. The bones of a strong budget remain from the hard lessons we learned through Act 47, but the financial picture is still bleak: there will be a shortfall of tens of millions of dollars this year, even taking into account our $85 million in reserves we have built up since 2014, which will then have heavy repercussions onto our next five years of budgets.<br>Large cuts to spending will likely be necessary — again, it will take the strength and perseverance of residents, workers and the greater Pittsburgh community to help us. <br>Years of city planning on resiliency going back to 2014 greatly helped us to prepare for the economic and public health shocks we’re experiencing now. But nothing fully prepared us for this. At no point will the need be greater for major nonprofits, foundations and the corporate community to come together collectively to guarantee a Pittsburgh For All.<br>But we will get there. No city is more resilient or better poised to recover than Pittsburgh. We will become better and stronger than ever, just as we have when generational crises have rocked us in the past. We’ve been knocked to our knees before and always find a way to stand back up — it’s in our DNA.<br>There will be a new normal, and we need to aim high.<br>We need to end the digital divide by making sure internet connectivity is as basic a right as electricity and gas. It is obvious that a laptop in a student’s hand is as basic as pens and pencils were in the past.<br>The early childhood world will transform and never be the same again. Full funding for childcare and Pre-K education is essential.<br>As we see around the country this health crisis has had a disproportional impact on our African American neighbors, and we must address all related underlying disparities. <br>Utilizing our tech and medical industry we can create greater accessibility to quality health care for all.<br>We need to double-down on commitments on clean energy and zero waste, building a new and resilient future. <br>We need to ensure family-sustaining wages for all. As we have learned our essential workers are on the front lines and have long been undervalued.<br>We need to put Western Pennsylvanians back to work with a massive infrastructure bill to address our needs and let our people do what they have done for generations: rebuild America.<br>Finally, all of this can happen through The Pittsburgh Way:<br>Leveraging the lessons we are learning from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will forge new partnerships among labor, the business, foundation and nonprofit communities, and our federal, state and county leaders, to make our city stronger than ever. It will require sacrifice by all. <br>All of this will be fueled by Pittsburgh’s single greatest resource: You.<br>Thank you Pittsburgh, and stay safe. | 16/4/2020 15:02:07 |

| Mayor Peduto Issues Letter to White House on Federal Support for Cities Fighting Pandemic | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 20, 2020) Mayor William Peduto has issued a letter to President Donald J. Trump urgently asking for $250 billion in emergency funding for Pittsburgh and other cities fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>“As your administration has stressed since the outbreak of COVID-19, while the emergency response effort is federally supported, it must be locally executed. The City of Pittsburgh is working hard to meet the needs of our residents, while suppressing the spread of COVID-19. As Pittsburgh continues to grapple with this crisis, I strongly urge you to support the inclusion of $250 billion in flexible funding for local governments in a future emergency coronavirus relief package,” Mayor Peduto wrote. <br>Pittsburgh and similar cities host the largest health systems in their regions, and employ the medics, police, refuse collectors and other workers on the front lines battling the pandemic. They also host great numbers of residents and businesses reeling from the economic hardships of the coronavirus; a side-effect of these hardships is a deep cut the tax revenues that pay for municipal workers. <br>The City of Pittsburgh estimates it will suffer a 21% cut in projected revenues in 2020, going from $608 million down to $481 million, for a total loss of $127 million. Over a five-year period from 2020-2024 the City expects to lose a total of $239 million, which amounts to a 7.5% cut. <br>These estimates are extremely fluid and will likely change depending on the length of business closures in the City. The tax revenues that are most in peril are payroll, parking, earned income and property taxes: these four taxes alone could see $97 million in losses just this year. <br>On the expense side, due to telework and staffing changes the entries into the City’s financial system have been delayed for weeks at a time. For that reason real-time financial forecasts are in flux, which is also making budget estimates challenging. <br>To do realistic five-year financial plans the City must perform financial outlooks that are responsible and unflinching. Pittsburgh government learned these hard lessons through 15 years in Act 47 oversight and must not return to budgeting through unrealistic financial gimmicks. To meet these challenges seriously and responsibly the City needs the federal government’s help right now. <br>Cities and states across the nation are facing the same budgetary uncertainties, yet our national recovery requires that such governments provide critical services. The City has joined with the U.S. Conference of Mayors in requesting the federal relief funds to protect its workers and keep delivering the essential government services needed to keep Pittsburgh and other cities safe. <br>“Despite years of sound fiscal management, the scale of this crisis has simply been overwhelming – it is only a matter of time before we will face cash flow issues affecting our ability to pay first responders and essential workers. We need relief and we need it now,” Mayor Peduto wrote. <br>A copy of [the letter to President Trump is here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9239_SIGNED_Trump_Letter.pdf). | 20/4/2020 09:56:40 |

| Mayor Peduto Joins Officials from United Kingdom and Sweden to Prepare for Post-Pandemic Economy | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 23, 2020) Mayor William Peduto today represented the United States in an international discussion on transitioning to a climate-friendly economy. <br>“Pittsburgh is a leading example of how turning to a knowledge-based economy can not only help our planet and our businesses, but provide new economic opportunities for the workers who built our region and others like it around the world. Doing this planning now will only make us stronger once our fractured economies reset for the post COVID-19 world,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Today’s discussion was organized by the [Institute for Public Policy Research](https://www.ippr.org/), the United Kingdom’s leading progressive think tank, and was chaired by British MP Ed Miliband. Besides Mayor Peduto speakers included officials from Sweden’s second-biggest city, Gothenburg, home to the Gothenburg Shipyard in Älvstranden, an industrial site shuttered in the 1970s that transitioned into a technology park offering training to unemployed shipbuilders. <br>Mayor Peduto shared with policymakers his proposals for an “American Marshall Plan,” which includes a call for major investments by the federal government in climate-friendly, non fossil fuel powered industries and jobs. <br>“Workers across Western Pennsylvania and the rest of the Rust Belt built this country, and they are poised to rebuild it once more for the 21st Century — we just have to give them the support to do so. This pandemic is hitting the reset button on the entire global economy, and the United States needs to be a leader in smart economic innovation that will lead to industries that are both more sustainable and profitable, and to a rebirth of the American middle class,” Mayor Peduto said. | 23/4/2020 12:18:55 |

| City of Pittsburgh Announces Gardening Guidelines for Community Gardens and Adopt-A-Lot Sites During COVID-19 | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 28, 2020) – The City, through the Departments of City Planning and Public Works, have announced guidelines for the public for using community gardens while maintaining CDC health guidelines. <br>Community gardens and Adopt-A-Lot sites are open, but the first priority is to keep each other safe at all times. To ensure that community members stay healthy while using public gardening spaces, the following guidelines have been established:<br>- When in doubt, stay home. Do not come to the garden if you or someone in your home is sick, if you are a member of a vulnerable population, or are a senior. <br>- Do not hold group volunteer days, no matter how small. <br>- Visit the garden alone or with members of your immediate household. <br>- If several people are at the garden, come back later. Limit the garden to 1-3 people at a time.<br>- For collective duties, make an online task list. Work done individually can still be shared by the community. <br>- Post signage with these guidelines and rules in public.<br>While at the garden, it is important to: <br>- Maintain social distancing by staying at least an arm and shovel length away from others.<br>- Wear a mask or cover your mouth and nose with a cloth. <br>- Be aware of high-touch surfaces and disinfect handles, water spigots, shed doors, etc. Avoid using community tools and bring your own. <br>- Remove all personal items and trash you bring to the garden. <br>- Thoroughly wash all produce you harvest from the garden. <br>- Avoid touching your face. <br>- Wash your hands regularly. <br>More information about Adopt-A-Lot sites can be found at [https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/programs/adopt-a-lot/index.html](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/programs/adopt-a-lot/index.html). <br>More information about community gardens can be found at [https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/garden-plots](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/garden-plots). <br>**For More Information:**<br>Shelly Danko+Day<br>Department of City Planning<br>[shelly.dankoday@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:shelly.dankoday@pittsburghpa.gov) | 28/4/2020 09:56:45 |

| Mayor Peduto Calls for Online SNAP Purchasing Options Due to COVID-19 Pandemic | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 29, 2020) Mayor William Peduto has issued a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in support of efforts to expand affordable food purchasing options — including delivery and online ordering — for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>The Mayor’s letter follows calls by U.S. Senator Bob Casey and others to expand the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides eligible low-income residents with an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) debit card to purchase food. <br>Currently, SNAP beneficiaries cannot do any purchases online. While other food consumers can use online ordering and delivery to protect themselves and others from spreading the coronavirus, low-income residents and families are forced to make their purchases in person, making them especially vulnerable to the disease.<br>[The Food Policy Council](https://www.pittsburghfoodpolicy.org/) wants the USDA to allow SNAP recipients to purchase food for delivery and to allow other safe food purchasing options, such as allowing users to use their EBT cards for Instacart or online farmers market services. <br>Sen. Casey [has been calling on the USDA](https://www.casey.senate.gov/newsroom/releases/action-needed-to-allow-snap-recipients-to-get-home-delivery-of-groceries-during-coronavirus-outbreak-casey-calls-for-immediate-solutions) to expand SNAP delivery options since the pandemic led to stay-at-home guidelines across Pennsylvania and the nation last month. <br>“As we face this global crisis together, it is critical that we safeguard food access for SNAP participants, especially senior citizens, individuals with disabilities, residents who do not have access to transportation, and others who are unable to leave their homes due to the spread of COVID-19. Enhanced partnerships between the USDA, state government, and retailers will help to eliminate barriers to reliable food access and provide our most vulnerable neighbors with peace of mind during an already stressful time in their lives,” Mayor Peduto stated. <br>A copy of the letter to Secretary Perdue [is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9310_SIGNED_Mayor_SNAP_Letter_.pdf). | 29/4/2020 11:26:51 |

| City of Pittsburgh Analyzing Summertime Activities | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 1, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh continues to monitor and plan for possible summertime activities, under ongoing guidance from Governor Tom Wolf’s administration during the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>In the meantime during periods of good weather this spring, such as this coming weekend, City officials strongly urge residents to practice social distancing and wear masks when in close proximity to others to help stop the spread of disease. <br>Chief Operations Officer Kinsey Casey is leading efforts to review the safe opening — if possible — of swimming pools, spray parks, organized sports, summer camps, playing field, summer concerts and films, and basketball and tennis courts in coming weeks or months. <br>As of today with the state’s opening of general construction activities, City personnel [have begun maintenance and repair of outdoor facilities](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3922) and other permitted work, such as on streets, forestry and debris cleaning. <br>Department of Mobility and Infrastructure Director Karina Ricks is reviewing plans for improving public spaces to allow for socially distanced recreation and the support of main streets.  <br>She has created a task force with leaders from the transportation, business, mobility and design sectors to create a toolkit for neighborhood and business groups to consider the possible use of sidewalks and partial or full road closures to enhance summertime recreation spaces and to boost commerce in neighborhood business districts. <br>No decisions on proposed closures of specific roadways — in business districts and/or city parks — have been finalized.

| City of Pittsburgh Implements Hiring Freeze | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 4, 2020) Mayor William Peduto announced today that he is instituting a hiring freeze for more than 60 currently unfilled positions within City government, in a move to save money during the deep budget impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>Not hiring the 64 positions will save the City an estimated $3 million in salaries. <br>“The dedication and perseverance of City workers, especially those working on the front lines, has been on full display during this pandemic, and on behalf of all city residents I can’t thank them enough for their public service,” Mayor Peduto said. “We have to put on hold these new hires, however, to help fill the ever-widening holes showing up in our budget due to this crisis.” <br>Mayor Peduto wrote to President Donald J. Trump two weeks ago in an effort to obtain emergency federal funding for the City, noting that estimates are for a 21% cut in projected City revenues in 2020, going from $608 million down to $481 million, for a total loss of $127 million. Over a five-year period from 2020-2024 the City expects to lose a total of $239 million, which amounts to a 7.5% cut. <br>No other budget cuts are being implemented at this time, though directors of City departments are being asked to review possible cuts to non-personnel costs of at least 10% citywide. <br>The hiring freeze impacts the following 64 unfilled positions, by department: <br>**Mayors Office**<br>-Office Manager <br>**Office of Management and Budget**<br>-Chief Financial Officer <br>-Assistant Director, Operating <br>**Innovation and Performance**<br>-Senior Manager Applications <br>-Assistant Applications Administrator <br>-Project Coordinator <br>-GIS Analyst <br>**Finance**<br>-Finance Systems Analyst <br>-Clerical Specialist 1 <br>**Law**<br>-Associate Solicitor <br>**HRCS**<br>-Training and Development Coordinator <br>-Talent Acquisition Coordinator <br>-HR Specialist <br>**City Planning**<br>-Community Affairs Liaison <br>-Senior Planner <br>-Planner 2 <br>-Clerical Assistant 2  <br>**PLI**<br>-Government and Public Relations Liaison <br>-2 Combined Operations Inspector <br>-Applications Technician <br>**Public Safety Administration**<br>-Safer Together PGH Coordinator <br>-2 Emergency Management Planners <br>-Accountant <br>**Police**<br>-Two classes of recruits this year instead of three <br>-2 Administrative Specialist <br>-8 Clerical Specialist 1 <br>-Clerk 2 <br>-6 Full Time Crossing Guards (this has no impact on existing Crossing Guard program) <br>**Animal Control**<br>-Animal Control Officer <br>**Fire**<br>-Fire Class will move forward with 24 instead of 32 candidates  <br>**EMS**<br>-July recruits will move forward, October will hold for further review <br>**Department of Public Works Administration**<br>-Clerical Assistant 2 <br>**DPW Operations**<br>-2 Inspector 1 <br>-2 Truck Driver <br>**Parks and Recreation**<br>-5 Rec Leader 1 <br>-Administrative Aide <br>-Fiscal and Contracting Coordinator <br>-3 Community Center Director <br>**Mobility and Infrastructure**<br>-Policy Analyst <br>-Communications Specialist <br>-2 Project Engineers <br>-Senior Systems Analyst <br>-Executive Assistant | 4/5/2020 08:57:01 |

It’s disappointing our efforts have had to come to this, but we’ll continue to show the court that our measures comply with every word of state law.”<br>"We believe city officials acted well within their authority when they passed these measures to prevent future gun violence,” said Eric Tirschwell, managing director for Everytown for Gun Safety. “We look forward to the Commonwealth Court’s review and are hopeful the trial court’s ruling will be corrected."<br>The ordinances blocked by the lower court’s ruling include:<br>- A prohibition relating to the use of assault weapons and large capacity magazines;<br>- A local Red Flag law which provides a judicial framework for families and law enforcement officers to petition for a court-issued Extreme Risk Protection Order, which temporarily restricts a person’s access to firearms when they pose a significant risk of harming themselves or others;<br>- A Child Access Prevention law which creates a civil penalty if a minor gains access to and uses a firearm, and the firearm’s custodian knew or reasonably should have known that a minor was likely to gain access to the firearm.<br>Copies of the briefs are available [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9361_2020.04.30_Appellant's_Brief_Filed.pdf) and [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9360_2020.05.01_Appellant's_Brief_Filed.pdf).<br>**About Everytown Law**<br>Everytown Law is the litigation arm of Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, and fights for the right of every American to be free from gun violence.

| EcoInnovation District Plan Receives National Excellence in Sustainability Award | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 5, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of City Planning along with its partner organizations received an Excellence in Sustainability, Community Plan award from the American Planning Association’s Sustainable Communities Division for the [EcoInnovation District Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/eid). The award honors projects, plans, policies, individuals and organizations whose work is dedicated to supporting sustainable communities. <br>The EcoInnovation District Plan combined the goals of both [EcoDistricts](https://ecodistricts.org/) and Innovation Districts to build a neighborhood plan for the Uptown area with a focus on healing the environment, supporting the needs of existing residents, and expanding job growth. The Uptown neighborhood is a four-block wide, 1.6 mile stretch of Pittsburgh between Downtown and Oakland, two of the largest employment centers in Pennsylvania. This EcoInnovation District Plan was the first plan adopted from the City’s [neighborhood planning program](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/np). <br>The planning process addressed concerns around safety, environmental problems, and disinvestment through an inclusive, comprehensive engagement strategy that built trust and partnerships in the community. In total, close to 1,000 people attended zero-waste public events, took the community-wide survey, participated in interviews or attended regular meetings, with thousands more engaging with the project online.<br>The resulting plan included infrastructure improvements, community-driven initiatives, and a new performance-based tools in the Zoning Code that incentivize affordable housing and energy efficiency. Proposed projects include sustainable buildings on publicly owned property, new and improved open spaces that treat stormwater, support for small businesses, a nature trail, district energy, new transportation tools that will reduce congestion and make the streets safer for everyone. A partnership with the [Green Building Alliance](https://www.go-gba.org/) ensures that all building proposals in Uptown receive green building consultations at the earliest stages when this information benefits projects and the community the most.<br>The process also helped the City and Port Authority of Allegheny County develop a more sustainable and community-driven proposal for Bus Rapid Transit on the Fifth and Forbes Avenue corridor. The planning process strengthened partnerships between organizations including Uptown Partners, Duquesne University, UPMC, Avenu, non-profits Green Building Alliance and Sustainable Pittsburgh, and public agencies at the City and County. These partnerships, and the formation of the [Uptown Task Force](https://www.uptowntaskforce.org/about-uptown-task-force/) as a forum for taking action on the plan’s vision, have allowed many of these projects to move forward into implementation.<br>“It is an honor to accept the Excellence in Sustainability award for the EcoInnovation District, which recognizes the work of the residents and community partners that were involved in the planning process. We look forward to continuing to work with those partners to make their vision a reality,” said Andrew Dash, acting director of the Department of City Planning. “The lessons we learned through the EcoInnovation District process continue to improve the neighborhood planning program, and the partnerships forged there have helped us establish new standards and programs for sustainable development.”<br>The EcoInnovation District Plan also received an award from the Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Planning Association for its focus on social equity, reusing underutilized spaces, creating an open space network, and public participation.<br>The [American Planning Association](https://www.planning.org/) (APA) is an independent, not-for-profit educational organization that provides leadership in the development of vital communities. APA includes a professional institute for certified planners, 47 chapters, 21 divisions, and special memberships for students. <br>The [APA Sustainable Communities Division's](http://planning.org/divisions/sustainable/) goal is to help planners engage in and collaborate on innovative approaches to emerging sustainability issues.<br>**For More Information:**<br>Derek Dauphin <br>Senior Planner, Project Manager<br>[Derek.Dauphin@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Derek.Dauphin@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>Andrew Dash, AICP<br>Acting Director<br>[Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov) | 5/5/2020 11:39:16 |

But we are far from beating this — Pittsburgh residents, workers and visitors need to keep focusing on social distancing, not leaving home if they are sick, wearing masks, washing hands and generally just being smart about fighting this still-spreading disease. <br>We owe it to our city’s heroic medical personnel and first responders to keep being vigilant, and we must do much more to test the greater population and to contact trace anyone who has tested positive for the virus. I have offered the assistance of the City of Pittsburgh to help implement these needed testing and tracing measures.” <br>For more information from the Governor’s office on rules for communities in the “yellow phase” of reopening during the pandemic, please see [these guidelines on phasing](https://www.governor.pa.gov/process-to-reopen-pennsylvania/), and [these guidelines for businesses](https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200504-COVID-19-Business-Guidance.pdf).   <br>For more information on the City’s response to COVID-19 and a data and operations timeline on City actions please see [the City of Pittsburgh’s coronavirus webpage](https://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/covid-updates). | 8/5/2020 13:38:40 |

| City of Pittsburgh Updates Budget Impacts from Pandemic | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 13, 2020) The latest budget numbers for the City of Pittsburgh in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic show severe dips in revenue collection matched with drops in spending as well. <br>From March through May 8 of this year, data from the Office of Management and Budget shows revenues were $94,401,623 while revenues for the same period in 2019 were $126,398,602. That is a difference of $31,996,979 and a drop of 25%. <br>Expenses from March through May 8 this were $101,542,050 while last year during that period they were $109,253,127. That is a difference in spending of $7,711,077 and a drop of 7%. <br>“The City is holding its own through frugal spending but the gaps between our revenues and expenditures are likely to widen further. With the help of City Council and the leaders of all City departments we will have to keep a hard watch on spending until the financial impacts of the  COVID-19 pandemic become clearer,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>[Last month the City estimated](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3888) it will suffer a 21% cut in projected revenues in 2020, going from $608 million down to $481 million, for a total loss of $127 million. Over a five-year period from 2020-2024 the City expects to lose a total of $239 million, which amounts to a 7.5% cut.  <br>The tax revenues that are most impacted by economic hardship triggered by the pandemic are payroll, parking, earned income and property taxes: these four taxes alone could see $97 million in losses just this year. <br>In response the City [instituted a hiring freeze](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3927) across all departments expected to save an estimated $3 million in salary this year, and is drafting plans for 10% cuts in non-personnel spending across all departments. | 13/5/2020 08:53:42 |

| DOMI Issues Report on Use of Streets and Mobility to Aid Community During Pandemic | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 18, 2020) A City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure advisory committee has presented a report focusing on how streets and mobility services could be used to support business and community health during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>The Committee, chaired by former Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Secretary Allen Biehler, was formed April 29 and convened four times between May 1 and May 11, and finished its report last week. The ad hoc committee was comprised of business owners, business association and development organization leaders, mobility providers, urban designers, technologists, and transportation professionals. <br>[The rapidly assembled report](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/covid-19) includes a number of recommendations including: <br>- Engage and empower more commercial areas across the city – particularly those that may lack organized business associations. <br>- Develop and deploy consistent advisory signage for business districts to direct patrons to queue, pick-up, and park safely and at an appropriate distance. <br>- Expand sidewalk space at high use bus stops, promote use of bicycles and bike share, and permit use of other small, sustainable micromobility devices. <br>- Better manage curbsides to enable space for local pick-up and delivery and sidewalk expansion space for queuing and seating. <br>- Address regulatory barriers that restrict non-traditional uses of the public right of way to support businesses. <br>- Develop approved standards and processes to enable “quick build” adaptation of streets to support businesses and neighborhood recreation. <br>Following the committee’s recommendations, the Department has initiated the following actions: <br>- [Launch a survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKhwBgfp6gKvrXtW_8Nzce97-fP52iVY44ZuijyQ3Hv1JMYA/viewform) of businesses across the city to better understand how streets and mobility could be used to support their reopening. <br>- Convert a number of actuated (push button controlled) pedestrian signals to recall (automatically triggering the pedestrian phase without pushing the button). <br>- Collaborated on a 72-hour “hackathon” this past weekend with local programmers and engineers to develop “PittsCurb” -  a tool to help manage efficient curbside use. <br>- Develop guidelines for the use of small powered mobility devices in the city. <br>- Develop a program to permit neighborhood slow streets to promote outdoor social distancing in residential areas. | 18/5/2020 12:18:36 |

| Parking Meter Enforcement to Resume Wednesday in Downtown Pittsburgh | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 18, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Parking Authority announced today that enforcement of metered parking spaces in the Central Business District Downtown will resume on Wednesday, May 20. <br>With the resumption of business activity allowed under Governor Tom Wolf’s yellow reopening phase, parking meter enforcement Downtown will allow for turnover in parking to support retail, restaurants and other businesses.  <br>Since the City shut down in mid-March and parking meter enforcement was suspended, many vehicles have stayed in parking spots all day, leading to complaints by restaurants that takeout customers were having trouble finding Downtown parking. <br>The PPA will temporarily allow the first half-hour of parking to be free, which will assist with take-out and pickup services by such businesses. Parkers must enter their license plate information into parking kiosks or their phone app to take advantage of the half-hour free parking. Only one free parking session can be used per day. <br>Enforcement officers began issuing warnings in Downtown today regarding the upcoming enforcement measures.<br>PPA parking garages Downtown remain open for workers seeking long-term parking. <br>Parking meter and residential permit parking enforcement remains suspended for the time being in all other city neighborhoods and business districts. | 18/5/2020 12:23:34 |

| City Parks Upgraded in National Study | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 20, 2020) City of Pittsburgh parks have been rated [15th best in the nation](https://www.tpl.org/city/pittsburgh-pennsylvania) for access and quality by the Trust for Public Land. <br>Five years ago the City’s parks were rated far worse, but have improved after commitments to improve them by Mayor William Peduto and City Council. In 2016 Pittsburgh’s parks were rated 39th in the country by the Trust’s [ParkScore index](https://www.tpl.org/parkscore), and moved up to 22nd in 2019.

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on URA Meeting on Lower Hill Development | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 20, 2020) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement on the vote scheduled for tomorrow by the board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) on the take down of the next parcel in the Lower Hill District development plans:<br>“The plans set for a vote tomorrow not only include a new headquarters for First National Bank but represent an extraordinary $200 million investment in the heart of Pittsburgh that will help brace our local economy in a time of great need.<br>If approved by the board after a week of deliberation, this will include the monetization of the previously approved LERTA tax abatement and parking tax diversion, which will make available an upfront $11 million to the URA to invest in community-driven housing and economic development initiatives in the greater Hill District. <br>This funding could be used to support the developments on Centre Avenue of minority businesses and development teams that the URA approved at its February 2020 board meeting. The agreement also takes the next step with the formalization of a First Source Hiring Center to spur workforce development and jobs on-site for Hill District residents, including minority hiring commitments.<br>This entire site will be providing good paying union construction jobs. The proposed agreement also includes a commitment to long-term career-building jobs on the site to provide Hill District residents with family sustaining wages to rebuild the middle class. <br>This is in addition to the commitments from the Penguins and BPG with the last parcels taken down, which included an investment in Rec2Tech in the Hill, improved recreation facilities, the completion of the Curtain Call public art installation, and the new Catapult MWBE small business incubator on the Lower Hill site.<br>Tomorrow’s vote will follow timely votes from the URA, Sports and Exhibition Authority (SEA) and City Council to take down the first parcels, approve a parking tax diversion, provide millions of additional dollars to the Greater Hill's affordable housing needs in the form of a Hill District Housing Reinvestment Account, and begin the take down of this next parcel.<br>This entire project has been a partnership among the community stakeholders, URA, SEA, the Housing Authority, myself, and the Penguins with the leadership of David Morehouse and Kevin Acklin.<br>Finally, this entire project has been driven by my clear goals of economic growth, family sustaining jobs, investment in the historic Centre Avenue, investment in affordable housing, workforce development, opportunities for youth **,** and support for MWBE small businesses in alignment with the Community Collaboration Implementation Plan.<br>I urge the URA board to approve this critical next step, and move this long-promised development forward.” | 20/5/2020 12:41:33 |

| City Files Legal Brief in Support of Eviction Protections by Governor and Attorney General | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 21, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Law Department filed an amicus brief yesterday with the state Supreme Court in support of an executive order from Governor Tom Wolf and Attorney General Josh Shapiro protecting Pennsylvanians from evictions or foreclosures through July 10, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>Wolf and Shapiro announced the order May 7, extending eviction protections for an extra 60 days past an original stay that was set to expire May 11. Landlords challenged their order in a King’s Bench petition filed with the Supreme Court. <br>Rejection of the eviction and foreclosure projections would hurt the City budget, force residents into homelessness, and compromise efforts to fight the coronavirus, the City’s brief argues. <br>“The unemployment surge caused by COVID19,” the brief says, “puts more households at risk of eviction for inability to pay rent. As many rental units in Pittsburgh are owned by many persons with a small number of properties, the policies and practices being implemented and contemplated for financial assistance to the unemployed will ultimately position tenants to pay overdue rent and provide many landlords with the revenues necessary to satisfy their real estate tax obligation to Pittsburgh within the budget year.” <br>It continues: <br>“Should landlords dispossess tenants from safe shelter when tenants have no financial resources to secure their own safe housing, they will end up nomads, moving into the households of family and friends for short-term stays. When those options are exhausted, members of the dispossessed households can end up homeless without shelter. Each of these possible outcomes compromises the success of social distancing and limited physical contacts within groups. Maintaining these public health practices is essential until the virus’ spread can be controlled with a tested vaccine.” <br>A full copy of the City’s brief [is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9574_Time_Stamped_Application_for_Leave_to_File_Amicus_Brief.pdf). | 21/5/2020 10:38:21 |

| City of Pittsburgh Commits to Renewable Electricity in All Major Facilities | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 22, 2020) In a significant step toward the City of Pittsburgh’s [climate action goals](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/climate-action-plan), all of the city’s major facilities will source their electricity from renewable resources.<br>The city and its partners in the Western Pennsylvania Energy Consortium (WPEC) announced this week that they have signed a 12-month agreement with Direct Energy for renewable energy supply. Direct Energy will source power and Green-e Certified renewable energy attributes offsetting 100% of the energy consumption and associated carbon emissions from the consortium members. <br>The contract will result in saving around $100,000 in energy costs for the city and $670,000 for WPEC members total. The city’s cost savings will go towards additional sustainability and energy efficiency projects that will result in additional cost savings.  <br>“Under this contract extension, the City will be meeting its renewable electricity goals for its facilities for the next year—a critical milestone from our climate action plan created in 2018,” Mayor William Peduto said. “Equally important, the extension is both environmentally friendly while also reducing energy costs for our Consortium members, demonstrating that good environmental and economic decisions can go hand in hand. I'd like to thank our City energy team, members of the WPEC, and the technical teams at Direct Energy and ENEL-X for helping us navigate these difficult times, but also through these tough times for creating an opportunity.” | 22/5/2020 11:44:23 |

| Mayor William Peduto Calls for Full Investigations of East Liberty Protests | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 3, 2020) Mayor William Peduto today called for a full, third party investigations by the Office of Municipal Investigations and the Citizen Police Review Board into the protests in East Liberty Monday evening, June 1. <br>“In order to provide clarity to the actions that occurred that day and provide third party, independent, professional analysis and recommendations, I am requesting the Office of Municipal Investigations to conduct a full investigation into the actions in East Liberty on Monday, June 1, 2020,” he wrote to OMI. <br>“For the past 36 hours, I have studied best practices of less lethal crowd dispersion, I have read countless comments on social media and viewed first-hand video, photographs and accounts. The Public Safety Director provided me with the written official transcripts of all Command operations during that day and I have talked with every person in the Command rank who was on the ground or in the Command Center. Without question, there is a difference of opinion about what happened that day and the appropriateness of the actions of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.” <br>He also asked for the CPRB to do an investigation, in conjunction with the ACLU, the NAACP Pittsburgh branch, and the U.S. Attorney’s office. [A copy of his letter is here.](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9727_CPRB_Letter.pdf)<br>A copy of [his letter to OMI is here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9728_OMI_East_Liberty_Letter.pdf). | 3/6/2020 13:37:00 |
| Mayor William Peduto Releases Police Reform Agenda | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 4, 2020) Mayor William Peduto today outlined his agenda for police reform. <br>The Mayor renewed his previous endorsement of use-of-force legislation introduced by state Representatives Summer Lee and Ed Gainey barring police from using deadly force during arrests, and using it only to protect against imminent threats of harm. <br>The Mayor also fully endorsed the State Legislature Police Reform Working Group’s slate of recommendations. The Working Group [has issued a list](https://pahouse.com/files/Documents/2020-06-02_031452__Updated%20Police%20Reforms%20(3).pdf) of other possible reforms, including outlawing the use of choke-holds, establishing an independent review process of any police encounter that results in serious injury or death, and naming an inspector general to systematically review police policies and behaviors to preemptively prevent police misconduct.   <br>Additionally, Mayor Peduto is calling on Pittsburgh Police and all police statewide to be required to go through annual implicit bias and de-escalation training. This is training Pittsburgh Police already receive but will be receiving more regularly. <br>Furthermore, the Mayor highlighted additional needed Harrisburg reforms that have challenged local government’s ability to create greater accountability and transparency. <br>Currently under Pennsylvania law, city leaders can fire or otherwise discipline police officers for misbehavior only to have the discipline overturned by arbitrators, and officers can only be de-certified for misconduct if they are found guilty of criminal charges.  <br>Further reforms could include:  <br>- Amending Act 111 to limit the scope of bargaining over disciplinary procedures or specifically limit a labor arbitrator's authority to modify disciplinary penalties    <br>- Amending Act 111 to adopt the "public policy exception," which would enable cities to challenge an arbitrator's decision to return an officer to work on the basis that their continued employment is adverse to the public interest  <br>- Amending the Confidence in Law Enforcement Act to expand the circumstances under which employers are required to terminate officers engaged in misconduct  <br>- Giving the Municipal Police Officers’ Education and Training Commission (MPOETC) more authority to revoke certifications from officers, or the ability to review use-of-force complaints to suspend or revoke certifications   <br>Change always must begin at home. The City is fully endorsing the “8 Can’t Wait” campaign (many of which the City has already implemented) and has already begun to review policies to make sure that Pittsburgh: <br>- Requires officers to de-escalate situations, when possible, before using force. <br>- Have a Force Continuum or Matrix included in their use of force policy, defining the types of force/weapons that can be used to respond to specific types of resistance. <br>- Explicitly prohibit chokeholds and strangleholds (including carotid restraints) or limit these tactics to situations where deadly force is authorized. <br>- Requires officers to give a verbal warning, when possible, before using deadly force.  <br>- Prohibits officers from shooting at people in moving vehicles unless the person poses a deadly threat by means other than the vehicle (for example, shooting at people from the vehicle). <br>- Requires officers to exhaust all other reasonable alternatives before resorting to using deadly force. <br>- Requires officers to intervene to stop another officer from using excessive force. <br>- Requires officers to report all uses of force including threatening another civilian with a firearm. <br>Additionally, the Mayor has signed [President Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper Alliance Pledge](https://www.obama.org/mayor-pledge/) to:  <br>1\. REVIEW the police use of force policies in my community <br>2\. ENGAGE my community by including a diverse range of input, experiences, and stories in our review <br>3\. REPORT the findings of our review to my community and seek feedback within 90 days of signing this pledge <br>4\. REFORM my community’s police use of force policies based on findings <br>Lastly, in line with growing research around the issue of "compassion fatigue" in law enforcement, the City will begin exploring the mandatory rotating of staff work assignments that could help to lessen the impact of long-term, high-stress assignments. <br>“These are critical steps we must take and we must take now. We must work to build trust between police and all they serve. We must undo the systems that have caused pain, suffering, and loss of life in communities of color. This is a first step, we must strive everyday to do better,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Translated Versions of this Information:<br>[ةطرشلاحلاصإجمانربردصيوتوديبمايليوةيدلبلاسيئر](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9845_ARABIC_Mayor_press_release_on_police_reform[1].pdf)<br>[威廉·佩杜托市长发布《警察改革议程》](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9846_CHINESE_Mayor_press_release_on_police_reform[1].docx)<br>[Le Maire William Peduto Rend Public le Programme de Réforme de la Police](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9820_FRENCH_Mayor_press_release_on_police_reform[1].docx)<br>[मेयरविवियमपेडुटोिेप्रहरीसुधारएजेण्डासािवजविकगिुवहुन्छ](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9847_NEPALI_Mayor_press_release_on_police_reform[1].pdf)<br>[El Alcalde William Peduto Da a Conocer la Reforma de la Policía](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9848_SPANISH_Mayor_press_release_on_police_reform[1].docx)<br>[Meya William Peduto Ametoa Ajenda Ya Marekebisho Ya Polisi](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9849_SWAHILI__Mayor_press_release_on_police_reform[1].docx) | 4/6/2020 09:28:23 |

| Pittsburgh Among Top 20 Best Cities for Bicycling | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 9, 2020) People For Bikes, one of the nation’s leading organizations dedicated to making bicycling safer, more convenient, and appealing for everyone has named Pittsburgh among the top 20 cities in the United States for people on bicycles.<br>For the first time, Pittsburgh has broken into the top tier of the more than 550 cities and towns included in the data-driven analysis by rounding out the top 20 in this year’s annual ratings. Last year the City was ranked 170th.<br>PeopleForBikes City Ratings evaluate communities across five key indicators: **Ridership** (how many people are riding bikes), **Safety** (how safe is it to ride bikes), **Network** (how easy is it for people to bike where they want to go), **Reach** (how well the network serves all parts of the community), and **Acceleration** (how fast the community is working to improve biking).<br>Pittsburgh performed particularly well in terms of both safety and acceleration. “The data shows Pittsburgh is showing real progress in making it easier for people to use bicycles as a safe, affordable, and enjoyable way to get around our compact city,” said Karina Ricks, Director of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure.<br>The progress is real. This year Pittsburgh completed a new Bicycle Master Plan ( [https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan)) and is working with neighborhoods across the city to add or enhance 30 miles of bicycle facilities this year that are safe and inviting for novice or experienced riders of all ages and abilities. In response to the COVID health crisis, the city has empowered residents to help establish a network of neighborhood slow streets to enable both physical activity and safe, easy, non-motorized travel to parks, transit and everyday destinations ( [https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/covid-19](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/covid-19)). <br>Making the top 20 is a significant accomplishment, but Pittsburgh will have to work hard to stay at the top. “Now in its third year, the City Ratings create a complete picture of bicycling in cities based on measurable factors,” says Rebecca Davies, PeopleForBikes’ bicycle networks data manager. “Top scorers are cities of all types and geographies who have succeeded in different ways, including cities that have made strong historical investments in active transportation as well as cities pursuing ambitious plans to rapidly implement high-quality bicycle networks on their streets.”<br>Data for the ratings comes from existing sources (including the U.S. Census American Community Survey and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System), as well as sources developed by the PeopleForBikes team to capture city-specific data based on mapping, city planning information and survey responses from community members. This year, individuals submitted a record-breaking 68,000 surveys. From these sources, 184 calculations are performed per city to determine the five category scores, as well as a city or town’s overall score. Read more about the methodology here: [https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/methodology/](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/methodology/) .<br>“City Ratings shows us what works: Places that have built better places to ride are seeing the benefits,” said Kyle Wagenschutz, director of local innovation for PeopleForBikes. “Our top scoring cities showcase the diverse ways that bicycling is thriving as a source of transportation, recreation, and inspiration. From San Luis Obispo, CA to Washington, DC — and all the places in between —  city leaders are recognizing bike networks help relieve traffic congestion, increase mobility and opportunity and make our cities healthier.”<br>City Ratings is a key component of the PlacesForBikes program, which provides measurement tools, guidance, peer networking and storytelling to help U.S. cities quickly plan, build and promote great places to ride of all kinds. PlacesForBikes is supported by a generous grant from Trek Bicycle Corporation, as well as contributions from other bike businesses, foundations and individuals.<br>For more information contact Karina Ricks at [karina.ricks@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:karina.ricks@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>**RESOURCES**<br>For complete results and additional program details, please visit [cityratings.peopleforbikes.org](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/) .<br>View additional media assets here: <br>[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/za1xnn1py2p7fzp/AAB3-5sBrPzvKo6EnrcuuLf\_a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/za1xnn1py2p7fzp/AAB3-5sBrPzvKo6EnrcuuLf_a?dl=0) | 9/6/2020 09:17:20 |
| Homewood Comprehensive Community Plan Adopted by Planning Commission | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 9, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Planning Commission last week unanimously adopted the Homewood Comprehensive Community Plan. <br>The development of the Homewood Comprehensive Community Plan was a collaborative effort of the Homewood Community Development Collaborative and the Department of City Planning, along with residents and stakeholders. The plan outlines ways to achieve the following vision: <br>_Homewood will be an African-American cultural destination where people choose to live, work, worship, and visit. It will be safe, green, healthy, and innovative. It will have quality schools. It will be a place that protects long-term and low-income residents and equips them to be engaged and informed._<br>Community leaders and members of Action Teams worked together to develop recommendations in response to the priorities that were defined by public meetings. Those recommendations were consolidated and prioritized to develop goals and paths to achieve those. The Plan is available for viewing at [https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/homewood-plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/homewood-plan).<br>“The Homewood Comprehensive Community Plan is a people-based plan that identifies the community needs that will promote a healthy, safe, green and innovative community,” said Christopher Corbett, project manager. “The implementation of this plan will be a collaborative effort of Homewood residents, organizations, and the City to make equitable and sustainable improvements throughout the community.”<br>Reverend Samuel Ware, co-chair of the Homewood Community Development Collaborative, said the plan is the result of participation from community residents and nonprofits, and with the support of the Department of City Planning. <br>“The COVID-19 pandemic and the protests of the homicide of George Floyd have shown light on the systemic disparities that negatively impact people of color across the globe,” Ware said. “I believe that the Homewood Comprehensive Community Plan if implemented will address those disparities. This puts Homewood ahead of other neighborhoods, cities, and nations who want to address the existing disparities. We are proud of the work we have done that places us in a position to immediately address and eliminate inequities that impact Homewood. Our work is not done but we thank all who have worked hard to bring us to this point. We are excited for what the future holds.”<br>“I am proud that the community has been able to choose a destiny that they have authored,” said Councilman Revered Ricky Burgess. “This document will guide the revitalization of Homewood. I am excited for Homewood’s future and committed to its success.”<br>**For More Information:**<br>Christopher Corbett<br>Project Manager, Neighborhood Planner<br>[Christopher.Corbett@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:ose.akinlotan@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>Andrew Dash<br>Acting Director, Department of City Planning <br>[Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:andrew.dash@pittsburghpa.gov) | 9/6/2020 13:09:10 |

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on George Floyd and Black Lives Matter | Pittsburgh is a city where we say there is no room for hate. Where, when we are met with adversity, we pull together to take care of our neighbors and come out stronger. In the past two weeks we have seen our neighbors and communities here and throughout the country and world demonstrating their grief, trauma, pain and anger. They are walking through the streets in honor of George Floyd. I’ve heard many people call this a moment – it is not a moment. This is the culmination of years and generations of racism – using housing regulations, employment barriers, education quality and inability to access other structures to negatively impact black people by not allowing them to have the same access to opportunities that other neighbors have.   <br>George Floyd is not a moment. He was a man with family and loved ones. His inexcusable death has motivated our communities to demonstrate the grief, trauma and pain that our black communities are consistently exposed to. We must listen.   <br>We all have pain. We all have grief and trauma. The City of Pittsburgh’s primary responsibility will always be to protect the health and safety of the people here. But when the color of your skin in this city and this country determines whether or not you will survive childbirth or makes you significantly more likely to develop health problems or controls how likely you are to get employment let alone upper-level management or leadership positions – we're not protecting all of our neighbors. When people in our city fear our civil servants and officers — we’re not protecting all of our neighbors.   <br>We’ve seen the power of policy to oppress our black neighbors over the past several hundred years. In our own city, our black neighborhoods were not just created by our black neighbors. They were created through the practice of redlining where banks denied loans to black people – veterans returning back from World War II with the same GI Bills as their white comrades – because the banks had set up desirable and undesirable neighborhoods and used policy regulations to give mortgages in one or the other based on race.  <br>What we have now is the power to use policy to build up our black neighbors and give them the opportunities that have been historically denied to them. That’s why equity has been a priority of this administration. It’s why we were the fifth city in the United States to create the Office of Equity to serve and advocate policy, services and programs for our most vulnerable residents. It’s why all senior officials from all city departments and authorities attended racial equity training and are using their training to make budgetary allocations to promote racial equity – to ask a simple but powerful question when making decisions: “How does this affect black residents?” It’s why we have Registered Community Organizations so all developers are required to meet with local residents and communities before their development plans in a neighborhood can even be reviewed by the city. It’s why we fund Learn & Earn and Rec to Tech for our youngest neighbors. It’s why we invest in minority and women-owned businesses. It's why we were one of only six cities chosen to launch President Obama’s 21st century policing initiative model and require all police officers to complete implicit bias training, a training we have expanded to employees across the city. While these are important steps for our city, it's clear that more must be done. It’s critical that our communities’ voices are heard in our policies and their needs are met through our policies.  <br>Reform doesn’t happen overnight and we don’t have all the answers right now, but the work has begun and we will continue to work directly with our communities to create a city that’s livable for all. Black neighbors, residents, partners – we hear you. Your voice is important and necessary to rebuilding. We will have phases of policy reform and we’ll talk and walk together the whole way. We will better collect racial and demographic data so that we know who we are serving and who we are not so we can do better.   <br>I do believe that we are a city where when we are met with adversity, we pull together to take care of our neighbors and come out stronger. It’s time again for us to go to work. Let’s work harder and let’s work better for ALL of our neighbors.  Especially our black neighbors who need our support right now. Our Black Neighbors Matter. Black Lives Matter.   <br>Translation:<br>[بيان من رئيس البلدية ويليام بيدوتو عن جورج فلويد و حياة السود مهمة](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10020_ARABIC_Mayor_Statement_on_George_Floyd_and_Black_Lives_Matter[2].pdf)<br>[市长威廉·佩杜托就乔治·弗洛伊德和“黑人的命也是命”发表的声明](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10021_Chinese_Mayor_Statement_on_George_Floyd_and_Black_Lives_Matter[1].pdf)<br>[Déclaration du maire William Peduto au Sujet de George Floyd et de Black Lives Matter](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10022_FRENCH_Mayor_Statement_on_George_Floyd_and_Black_Lives_Matter[1].docx)<br>[जोजज फ्लोइड तथा ब्ल्याक लाइभ्स म्याटरबारे मेयर विवलयम पेडुटोको बयान](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10023_NEPALI_Mayor_Statement_on_George_Floyd_and_Black_Lives_Matter(ne)[1].pdf)<br>[Declaración del Alcalde William Peduto sobre George Floyd y Black Lives Matter (Las Vidas de los Negros Importan)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10024_SPANISH_Mayor_Statement_on_George_Floyd_and_Black_Lives_Matter[1].docx)<br>[Taarifa na Meya William Peduto juu ya George Floyd na Wimbi la  “Black Lives Matther”](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10025_SWAHILI__Mayor_Statement_on_George_Floyd_and_Black_Lives_Matter[1].docx) | 11/6/2020 16:38:50 |
| Milling and Paving Coming to Districts 1 and 6 | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 12, 2020) Vehicle owners are reminded to heed alerts from the City and move their vehicles from streets set to be milled or resurfaced starting on Monday, June 15. <br>The list of impacted streets [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). All of the new streets on the list are in City Council Districts 1 and 6.<br>This year the City is investing nearly $15.7 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout the Pittsburgh.   <br>Roughly 27 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>As many residents are staying indoors and sheltering in place, the City is making an extra effort to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving [are posted on the DOMI website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/street-resurfacing) and will be publicized through city social media channels.   <br>Residents who have registered to receive telephone alerts from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will receive robocalls if their street is to be paved the following week (residents [can sign up for alerts here](https://srv1.publicnotify.com//pwsa/login.php) or by calling 412-255-2423).

| Sheraden Park Master Plan Completed, Implementation Set to Begin This Year | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 11, 2020) The Department of City Planning has completed the Sheraden Park Master Plan and will begin working toward implementation of projects and programs. <br>The [Sheraden Park Master Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/sheraden-park) prioritizes the park’s ecology, improves access and park visibility, provides new amenities to the community, and makes important basic improvements. The goal of the plan is to guide the development of a safe and healthy park that residents felt invested in. <br>The final plan focuses on six categories of improvements: <br>- Circulation and access to the park through bicycle lanes, road connections, a pedestrian bridge to McKees Rocks, parking improvements, and hiking trail additions. <br>- Facility improvements to rest areas and park buildings, stair repair, lighting and safety improvements, and tunnel murals.<br>- Social and educational additions including Lewis & Clark historical signage, an ADA accessible community garden, an apiary, event seating, wilderness education area, and a dog park. <br>- Nature-based recreation opportunities including mountain bike trails, kayak rentals, boardwalk along Chartiers Creek, and a pier for fishing, birding, and exercise. <br>- Organized recreation spaces including full-size football and soccer fields, sand volleyball courts, relocation of basketball courts, programming for youth and adult recreation leagues, discovery garden play area, relocation of the Tuxedo Park skate park, forest embankment slides, a boat launch in Chartiers Creek, and a dirt bike facility. <br>- Environmental improvements include slope stabilization, invasive species management, aquatic habitat protection and management, rain gardens and stormwater ponds, and subsurface detention. <br>The Plan also creates a unified network of parks for Sheraden residents that brings together Sheraden Park, McGonigle Park, and Tuxedo Street Park, and makes Sheraden Park the first park in the West End with direct access to water by including property owned by [ALCOSAN](https://www.alcosan.org/) into the park.<br>Studio Bryan Hanes, consultants on the development of the plan, will provide additional support for small projects and events for residents and community organizations. <br>The City is completing a grant for funding to match City budget for Phase I implementation. The next steps for Sheraden Park will be design and construction of projects through the Department of Public Works, which will include additional community engagement opportunities. <br>“The Sheraden community was heavily involved in the planning process and together we developed a plan that will bring the community a safe, accessible park with recreational opportunities for everyone,” said Martina Battistone, project manager. “The plan truly reflects the priorities of the community that we heard through the public engagement process, and we are excited to begin implementing the plan through collaboration with key stakeholders and organizations.”<br>“I am grateful to Mayor Peduto for making District 2 a priority in the 2020 budget,” said Theresa Kail-Smith, councilwoman for District 2. “The work in Sheraden Park is evidence of his commitment to our area. We appreciate his Chief of Staff Dan Gilman, City Planning, and the residents who contributed to the creation of the plan, especially the tremendous number of children who made their voices heard. I am looking forward to the beginning of implementation.”<br>Read the full plan [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/sheraden-park).<br>**For More Information:**<br>Martina Battistone<br>Project Manager, Senior Environmental Planner<br>[Martina.Battistone@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:ose.akinlotan@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>Andrew Dash<br>Acting Director, Department of City Planning <br>[Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:andrew.dash@pittsburghpa.gov) | 12/6/2020 09:04:03 |

| City Announces Plans for an Office of Community Health and Safety | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 12, 2020) The Office of Mayor William Peduto, Office of Equity and Department of Public Safety have announced their blueprint for a new Office of Community Health and Safety. The office will redirect city resources to better meet community needs by housing social services, public health and social work experts who can assist first responders in situations that require longer-term assistance, harm reduction support and other services.  <br>“Our public safety personnel are available 24/7 but often go into situations that are beyond the scope of their training. The individuals and communities they encounter need help beyond law enforcement or emergency medical attention,” Mayor William Peduto said. “This office will allow public safety to step back and determine what kind of support an individual or family needs and get them that help through social workers or other agencies so that we're seeing people holistically and connecting them with more sustainable resources and assistance.”<br>The proposed office will operate under the co-direction of the Department of Public Safety and Office of the Mayor. The goals and directives of the office are to:   <br>1. Develop community health and safety priorities and areas of focus based on community input and areas of need most frequently encountered by public safety personnel.      <br>2. Establish a group of community health and safety advisors made up of public health leaders to advise, educate, support and inform on best practices for sustainable social and health support in city programs, policies and legislation.   <br>3. Conduct regular trainings with all public safety personnel designed in collaboration between staff, experts and communities to ensure first responders are prepared to appropriately engage with complex situations that may require additional harm reduction support.   <br>4. Collaborate with higher education programs throughout the city to provide training opportunities for social work students to help respond to community needs.    <br>The preliminary areas of focus for community support include:    <br>- Racism   <br>- Violence   <br>- Poverty   <br>- Environmental Health   <br>- Mental Health   <br>- Homelessness   <br>- Problematic Substance Use and Overdose Prevention   <br>- Training and Education   <br>- Criminal Justice Reform & Re-entry   <br>- Youth Engagement   <br>- Community Paramedicine and Decreasing Public Safety Overutilization   <br>- Trans-health and Wellbeing   <br>- Jurisdictional Inequity   <br>- Harm Reduction   <br>- Maternal-Child Health   <br>- Suicide Prevention   <br>- Supports for People with Disabilities<br>These areas of focus are dynamic and subject to change based on input from the community and situations most commonly encountered by public safety personnel. <br>"This initiative will give the community relations units in all bureaus as well as all police officers, firefighters and emergency medical personnel the support that is critical to improving not just our high standards of service, but also our relationships with the community," said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. <br>The Mayor’s Office and Department of Public Safety will work with City Council to determine reallocations in the 2021 budget and identify additional external funding opportunities for this initiative. | 12/6/2020 13:58:30 |

A Housing Opportunity Fund (HOF) program designed to stimulate housing investment, DPCCAP provides financial assistance to eligible first-time homebuyers in the City of Pittsburgh who are interested in purchasing an existing or newly constructed residential unit. <br>“We started this program almost exactly a year ago on May 1,” said Director of Housing Initiatives Jessica Smith Perry. “Now that the word is out about the program, the goal is to try to do twice the amount of loans over the next 12 months.” <br>The DPCCAP offers first-time homeowners: <br>- Under 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) up to $7,500 in the form of a 0% interest, 5-year deferred loan.  <br>- Between 80% AMI and 115% AMI up to $5,000 in the form of a 0% interest, 10-year deferred loan.  <br>No payments are made during the term of the loan if residency requirements are met. <br>“Many people dream of owning their own home but due to numerous circumstances that’s all it will ever be — a dream. This program helps make that dream a reality,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Following are profiles of three city residents who have been helped by the program. <br>**Noah Rectenwald**<br>Noah Rectenwald is one of those new and proud homeowners who took advantage of the DPCCAP and the recipient of the 100th loan.  <br>Noah Rectenwald had been renting in Lawrenceville for four years. He and his significant other found out about the HOF through Lawrenceville’s Community Land Trust homebuyer program, which they had applied to with hopes of owning a house in Lawrenceville. It soon became clear to them how daunting the upfront costs would be, so when they were told there was help through the DPCCAP they were excited. <br>“The HOF equalizes opportunity towards home ownership by supporting first-time buyers that qualify for assistance. The DPCCAP funds help eliminate the stumbling blocks of up-front costs that keep aspiring homeowners from achieving their goal,” said Rectenwald.  <br>“Buying our home in Lawrenceville could not have happened without the HOF’s Down Payment and Closing Cost Assistance Program. We didn’t want to move and leave our neighborhood of four years. If not for this program, we would have had to continue renting and postpone our dream of homeownership.” Read more of [Noah’s story](https://www.ura.org/news/noah-rectenwald-100th-recipient-of-the-dpccap-has-positive-experience-buying-home). <br>**Susan Smith**<br>Easy. Accommodating. Friendly. Trustworthy. Those are just a few of the adjectives Susan Smith used to describe the DPCCAP.  <br>“People were responsive and easy to communicate with, and they followed through. I can’t really separate the people from the program – the people make the program. The people running the program want it to be successful. The HOF support services are one of its greatest strengths. The breadth of services is wonderful.” <br>Susan and her husband had only lived in Pittsburgh for three years before they purchased their house.  <br>“The HOF staff made something possible for us that we couldn’t have done on our own. They recognize that homeownership can be prohibitive for people. People that live paycheck to paycheck need security, too. Many of us are working over 40 hours a week, trying, and failing. <br>“For us, the assistance program was life-changing - we pay half of what we paid in rent in mortgage. And that’s with the escrow and the taxes, too,” said Smith. Read more of [Susan’s story](https://www.ura.org/news/susan-smith-credits-housing-assistance-as-life-changing). <br>**Celestin Uwintonze**<br>Celestin Uwintonze had been living in Housing Authority housing when he heard about the program and was interested. He took the required first homeowner classes, and as a result of the background check discovered that he needed more time to improve his credit score. <br>“The URA representatives coached me on how to improve my credit score, and once I had paid my debts, I reached back to the URA, and that’s how it began,” said Uwintonze. “People might think they don’t have enough money to buy a house or improve their credit, but the HOF can support people in achieving these goals. They provide opportunities.” <br>Uwintonze has three children - a daughter and two sons - and really needed a 3-bedroom house for his family.  <br>“A home loan is a large debt, and I really wanted to make sure I could afford the house long-term. I was very conscious of the long-term costs and knew I didn’t want to buy a house that would create too large of a financial burden for me and my family. I balance my budget every month, I do one project at a time, and am careful and thoughtful with my money. The HOF helped me buy a house we love that was within our means.” <br>They moved in December 2019. Read more of [Celestin’s story](https://www.ura.org/news/celestin-uwintonze-improved-credit-and-bought-a-home-with-the-help-of-hof). <br>In order to be eligible for DPCCAP, borrowers must meet the following requirements:  <br>- The borrower’s annual gross household income may not exceed 115% of the AMI.  <br>- The borrower must be purchasing the home as his/her primary residence and have his/her name on the deed.  <br>- The borrower must not have any outstanding City, School, and County real estate taxes, or the borrower must be on a payment plan for at least six months. <br>Properties considered eligible: <br>- A permanent structure used primarily for year-round residential use.

| Peduto Administration To Create LGBTQIA+ Commission | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 18, 2020) Mayor William Peduto’s administration is forwarding legislation to City Council to create a permanent LGBTQIA+ Commission within City government. <br>The Mayor created a LGBTQIA+ Advisory Council in 2016. Under legislation being introduced to City Council next week an 11-member LGBTQIA+ Commission would be placed into the City Code, meet monthly, and advise City government on plans and policy recommendations to address challenges facing the LGBTQIA+ community. <br>“The City of Pittsburgh has long been a leader in protecting and preserving LGBTQIA+ rights, but our city, state and country still have a long way to go. Placing this commission into City Code will re-emphasize our commitment to fighting for the human rights deserved by all,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>"We are so proud that the LGBTQIA+ Advisory Council of Pittsburgh will be making its transition into a commission, a commission geared to serve our LGBTQIA+ communities of Pittsburgh in ways that it has not before. The commission will usher in this ‘new normal’ we speak of after experiencing this COVID-19 pandemic, while unapologetically moving forward in ways to shift us into a city that values intersectional leadership,” said a statement from the Advisory Council. <br>Mayor Peduto is making an open call for those interested in becoming Commission members. If the Commission is finally approved by Council, those interested in joining may email the City at lgbtqia@pittsburghpa.gov. <br>Under the legislation, the Commission would have the following roles: <br>1. The LGBTQIA+ Commission shall conduct studies and analyses, seek out best practices, and develop action plans to address challenges facing LGBTQIA+ residents and visitors of Pittsburgh.  <br>2. The LGBTQIA+ Commission shall serve as a conduit between members of the LGBTIQA+ community and the City of Pittsburgh and connect residents with services. <br>3. The Commission shall engage with members of the LGBTQIA+ community regularly.  <br>4. The LGBTQIA+ Commission shall work with City departments, bureaus, agencies, and authorities to assist in the creation of cultural competency training opportunities. <br>5. The LGBTQIA+ Commission shall conduct outreach to City departments, bureaus, agencies, and authorities and external organizations and provide information and resources pertaining to the needs of members of the LGBTQIA+ community.   <br>6. The LGBTQIA+ Commission shall develop outreach and advocacy programming in an effort to create a more inclusive and equitable city for LGBTIQA+ residents and visitors, especially people of color and transgender individuals. <br>A copy of the proposed legislation, to be introduced on Tuesday, [is available here.](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10098_LGBTQIA+_Legislation_FINAL_(2)_(1).pdf)<br>[![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10104_A08707F0-0C66-4F82-A26C-084E35A017DB.jpeg)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10104_A08707F0-0C66-4F82-A26C-084E35A017DB.jpeg)<br>(City-County Building lit for Pride Month.

| West Ohio Street Bridge Reconstruction Project To Begin | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 18, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is pleased to announce the start of construction on the new West Ohio Street Bridge over the Norfolk Southern Railroad in Allegheny Commons Park in the Allegheny Center neighborhood of the City. The bridge has been closed to traffic since January 2018 due to deterioration of the 117-year-old structure. When construction is completed in the Fall of 2021, the new West Ohio Street bridge will support a full return of service between Allegheny Commons and Allegheny West.<br>In the coming weeks, a temporary pedestrian bridge will be installed to allow for continuous pedestrian access over the railroad during the project. <br>For questions, please contact the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure at zachary.workman@pittsburghpa.gov. | 18/6/2020 11:10:50 |
| City Welcomes Completed Kelly Hamilton Homes to Homewood | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 18, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh is happy to welcome new affordable housing units to Homewood. <br>KBK Enterprises completed 58 new housing units at the Kelly Hamilton development, a mixed-income community consisting of 42 affordable and 16 market-rate units. A ribbon-cutting had been planned for the spring but had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>Work is nearly complete on a new community center for the development, and new streets and landscaping are part of the upgrades. <br>The Kelly Hamilton team actively engaged with local MWBE businesses to create economic opportunities on the project and outperformed its goals: developers hired 34 Section 3 low-income employees and contracted with 61% MWBE companies. <br>“This is an example of a housing development that is good for Homewood, good for homeowners of all incomes, and good for business. This is the kind of work — and opportunity — that we need to see spread across all corners of Pittsburgh,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>All of the affordable units are fully leased. There are only two and three bedroom market-rate units still available.  Those interested in market-rate units may contact the temporary leasing office at (412) 361-0567.  <br>Online tours are available here at [https://www.apartments.com/kelly-hamilton-pittsburgh-pa/7429nmw/](https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apartments.com%2Fkelly-hamilton-pittsburgh-pa%2F7429nmw%2F&data=02%7C01%7Ctimothy.mcnulty%40pittsburghpa.gov%7C0068e66753884c71ca9e08d8138ba88c%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C0%7C637280837842952389&sdata=6W0%2Bp5YhhzOmIaaE4R%2F5zKu1QPfhQ11dk%2FIfiNJd%2Bis%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://www.apartments.com/kelly-hamilton-pittsburgh-pa/7429nmw/.

| Mayor Peduto Calls for Transparency in Release of Police Body-Worn Camera Footage | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 19, 2020) Mayor William Peduto is calling for changes to state law to make it easier for city officials to quickly release footage from police body-worn cameras.  <br>Last year Pittsburgh Police invested $10 million in new cameras for more than 900 officers. Yet, pursuant to existing law, city leaders are barred in most circumstances from immediately releasing body-worn camera footage to the public.  <br>“Now more than ever cities need to show transparency and accountability for police actions, and city leaders across Pennsylvania need more power to share taxpayer-funded camera footage with the public as soon as possible. This is allowed in many states across the nation and should be here as well,” Mayor Peduto said.  <br>“Body-worn cameras are known to protect both the public and police by providing unfiltered checks on community-police interactions. Pittsburgh and other cities in the Commonwealth must be given the flexibility to quickly release such footage in designated situations in compliance with applicable law.” | 19/6/2020 10:38:11 |

| Milling and Paving Continuing Across Pittsburgh Next Week | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 19, 2020) Vehicle owners are reminded to heed alerts from the City and move their vehicles from streets set to be milled or resurfaced starting on Monday, June 22. <br>The list of impacted streets [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). New streets on the list are in City Council Districts 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9.<br>This year the City is investing nearly $15.7 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout the Pittsburgh.   <br>Roughly 27 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>As many residents are staying indoors and sheltering in place, the City is making an extra effort to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving [are posted on the DOMI website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/street-resurfacing) and will be publicized through city social media channels.   <br>Residents who have registered to receive telephone alerts from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will receive robocalls if their street is to be paved the following week (residents [can sign up for alerts here](https://srv1.publicnotify.com//pwsa/login.php) or by calling 412-255-2423).

| Mayor William Peduto's Response To 12 Collective Demands | ![City of Pittsburgh Seal](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/8877_city-seal-mayor-history.png)<br>June 22, 2020<br>Dear Members of the Allegheny County Black Activist/Organizer Collective,<br>First of all, I want to thank you for taking the time to present your demands to my office. I am committed to creating safer and healthier communities, investing in critical services, advancing racial equity and racial justice, reforming our criminal justice system, and uplifting, protecting, and improving the quality of life for our Black and Brown neighbors, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and immigrants and refugees. <br>As our nation, our region, and our city honor the memory of George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, Breonna Taylor, Antwon Rose II, and so many other Black Lives lost to police-involved violence, your passion, energy, and voice on how to move forward are valued and cherished. Your continued engagement and hard work will be invaluable as the City of Pittsburgh and our partners carry out these important initiatives and strive to build a more equitable Pittsburgh. Meaningful change will not happen overnight, but we must do our part everyday to eradicate the racial disparities that are so plainly evident in our city and our society and have been for generations. <br>As you requested, my response to each of your demands and the actions that we, as the City of Pittsburgh, can and will take and have taken are outlined below. While some of the demands fall solely within the jurisdiction of another level of government, others are within the City’s authority. In the formation and implementation of each of the initiatives listed below, community engagement and input will be vital. <br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<br>**1\. Defund the Police and Fund Black Communities**<br>Since taking office, I have been committed to investing in our neighborhoods and building a Pittsburgh for all. I remain committed to providing funding for initiatives that advance racial equity and important projects and programs that uplift and protect Black lives, including safer streets, affordable and healthy housing, commercial district revitalization, enhanced neighborhood parks and recreation centers, workforce development programs, and more. I am focused on rebalancing our City’s Capital and Operating Budgets to move towards a more holistic, public health-driven, and community-guided approach to public safety. <br>Our Office of Equity, one of only five such agencies in the nation, is dedicated to providing economic opportunity to and uplifting Pittsburgh’s communities of color. Through the Rec2Tech program, which transforms our recreation centers into after-school classrooms where children can learn coding and game design, we have provided hundreds of children with opportunities to build 21st century skills that will benefit their future. Through the Summer Learn and Earn program, we have provided meaningful summer employment to thousands of Pittsburgh kids. Our My Brother’s Keeper Initiative works to create a brighter future for young Black men and Black boys. The Urban Redevelopment Authority has refocused its efforts on neighborhood-level investment in communities of color to build black wealth, create access to homeownership, develop and maintain safe and affordable housing, and more. <br>Still, there is a lot more work to be done, and that is why I am committed to applying a lens of racial equity to all of the initiatives we create and in all of the projects we fund. We have partnered with the Government Alliance on Racial Equity (GARE) to include a racial equity lens in our budgeting process. We have also partnered with Living Cities to transform our contracting and purchasing polices and procedures to encourage greater participation from MWBE firms. I am committed to listening to Black and Brown voices as we develop new programs and build on the progress we’ve made with existing programs. I plan to continue seeking community input and working with City Councilmembers to ensure that the City’s Operating and Capital Budgets in 2021 and beyond reflect our moral priorities as a community. <br>I recently launched an Office of Community Health and Safety, which will redirect social and public health services, including harm reduction, suicide prevention, mental health services, youth engagement, homelessness services, trans-health and well-being, and more, from Police Officers to the social workers and public health experts who are trained to carry out these critical services. I will work to adequately fund and empower this new agency. Most important to the formation of this new agency will be your voice and engagement; we will be relying on our neighbors’ input to ensure that the City is responding to the most important social service and public health needs in each neighborhood. We will continue to evaluate the types of situations that may require an alternative type of first responder, and we will work to decrease overutilization of public safety resources and offer assistance to all of our neighbors. <br>This work will build off the many reforms we initiated as part of the original cohort of cities in President Obama’s 21st Century Policing Task force. This included being one of the first cities in the country to require all officers to go through implicit bias training. I have announced that this will become an annual requirement for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.<br>I established the Pittsburgh Community Task Force on Police Reform, a diverse and unique group of community advocates and cross-sector leaders, to conduct a thorough community engagement process, review current police practices, and offer people-centric solutions for improving police-community relations and making Pittsburgh a better and safer place for all, especially in our Black communities. This Task Force is an important aspect in our commitment to President Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper Alliance Pledge, which charges the City with reforming our Police Bureau with community input. I am confident that the Task Force will create community-focused recommendations and implementation plans that boost the community’s trust in the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. <br>As Mayor, I implemented the Gender Equity Commission. While the United States sadly remains one of five countries not to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), Pittsburgh has officially adopted this initiative. We commissioned a study with the University of Pittsburgh that shined the light of transparency on the inequity and disparity across numerous metrics that face Black women in Pittsburgh. We all know there is tremendous work to be done to improve the quality of life, health and economic opportunity for Black women. The work being done by the Gender Equity Commission is leading the nation and last year we were awarded CEDAW Global Leadership Award by the United Nations NGO Committee on the Status of Women in recognition of the work being done.<br>I recently announced the creation of an LGBTQIA+ Commission to serve as a liaison between City Hall and Pittsburgh’s LGBTQIA+ residents. By centering LGBTQIA+ voices, especially trans women of color who face disportionate rates of discrimination and are murdered at higher rates than any other community, we can improve the lives our LGBTQIA+ neighbors. I also support legislation sponsored by City Councilmembers Burgess and Lavelle to create a Racial Equity Commission to combat institutional racism and increase racial equity in everything we do in City government. <br>As our city recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disportionately impacted communities and residents of color, it is more important than ever to double down on our efforts to fund projects and programs that uplift, support, and protect Black and Brown neighbors. It is imperative that we ensure that all of Pittsburgh can recover from this unprecedented pandemic in an equitable way. I will continue to allocate City funding and advocate for our State and Federal governments and philanthropic community to join us in investing in a Pittsburgh for all. <br>While I am proud of the progress we’ve made to advance racial equity and build safer and healthier communities, I am committed to taking action to reform our Bureau of Police in a meaningful and community-driven way, while still investing in social and public health services, in our neighborhoods, and in our people, especially people of color. <br>**2\. Demilitarize the Police**<br>I will evaluate Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Chief’s Order 12-7 entitled “Discharge of Firearms and Less-Lethal Weapons,” which governs when and how “less-lethal weapons” are utilized. We will work with the Community Task Force and experts around the country to make sure our policies and practices reflect our commitment to community safety and free speech.  <br>I will also charge my Pittsburgh Community Task Force on Police Reform with studying best practices and making recommendations to modify Pittsburgh’s policies on the acquisition and use of various types of weaponry. It is important to note that the City has not been participating in the purchase of any military surplus for a number of years. It is always important to reassess our current practices to ensure that our public safety approach is one that is rooted in protecting and serving the community and carried out with equipment appropriate for civilian settings.<br>As part of being one of the first cities to fully endorse the “8 Can’t Wait Campaign,” I have been and will continue to assess internal policies and Chief’s Orders that govern the use of force to ensure that:<br>- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has a Force Continuum or Matrix included in their use of force policy, defining the types of force/weapons that can be used to respond to specific types of resistance<br>- Pittsburgh Police Officers cannot shoot at moving vehicles<br>- Pittsburgh Police Officers cannot use chokeholds or strangleholds that caused the deaths of George Floyd and Eric Garner <br>- Pittsburgh Police Officers must intervene to stop another officer from using excessive force<br>- Pittsburgh Police Officers are required give a verbal warning, when possible, before using deadly force<br>- Pittsburgh Police Officers are required to exhaust all other reasonable alternatives before resorting to using deadly force<br>- Pittsburgh Police Officers are required to report all uses of force including threatening another civilian with a firearm.<br>- Pittsburgh Police Officers are required to de-escalate situations, when possible, before using force<br>            I fully endorse legislation sponsored by Pennsylvania State Representatives Summer Lee and Ed Gainey which would prohibit police from using deadly force during arrests except in cases with imminent threats of harm. I was honored to support this legislation from the very start and offer my full support to get this passed. I also support efforts by other Pennsylvania State Legislators to further define and limit use of force. <br>The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has partnered with the Israeli government around counterterrorism work, not neighborhood policing, in the past. As part of our comprehensive review, I will also carefully review whether or not this program is beneficial moving forward.<br>**3\. End the Criminalization of Black People**<br>I appreciate and rely on community members, organizers, and activists in the effort of continued public engagement. The City of Pittsburgh stands with you in solidarity in not only expressing your freedom of speech but also holding public servants responsible when warranted. Information and evidence are at the forefront of all public safety decision making. It is the mission of the City of Pittsburgh to provide a positive, community-based approach to public safety.<br>I am committed to the continued growth and support of the community policing we launched back in April 2017. The community must be the focal point when it comes to public safety. Public safety officials exist to keep communities safe and there must be coordination and representation from communities. Additionally, twice a year, we sponsor an opportunity for citizens in the Pittsburgh community to become closely acquainted with the roles and responsibilities of the Police Bureau through Citizens Police Academy. The Pittsburgh Student's Police Academy brings the police and Pittsburgh's high school community closer together in a setting that offers a sample of police training to each participant.<br>Additionally, as Mayor, I have worked with the Chief to create a Civilian Affairs Unit fully dedicated to positive engagement with the public. We have significant increased the number of Community Affairs Officers in each zone and established the Neighborhood Resource Officer program to rebuild closer ties between the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the communities they serve.<br>In addition to Community Relations Officers, Citizen's Police Academy, and Student Police Academy, we are open to continued conversations on how to build upon the community-policing model. Community members must be present and active with the Department of Public Safety so the community is best served.<br>Furthermore, we maintain a database to better track data on traffic stops, we cut saturation patrols of majority-minority neighborhoods, supported the decriminalization of marijuana locally and supported statewide legalization efforts, supported and implemented “Ban the Box” legislation, worked with the CPRB and ACLU to try and create clearer guidelines for protests/marches and the City of Pittsburgh has halted any predictive policing programs and is reviewing all work to ensure that policing is done without implicit or explicit bias.<br>In Fall 2018, the City’s Department of City Planning invited the Pittsburgh community to participate in a panel on public engagement and a Public Engagement Working Group to review and renew the approach to public participation. The Public Engagement Working Group included a diverse and broad range of experts in public engagement, including individuals representing local universities, public schools, faith-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, and community organizations. Public Engagement will continue to be at the forefront of my administration, and our public engagement efforts are useless without the value and experience community members share with us.<br>I promise to continue to lead all departments in work for the benefit and advancement of Pittsburgh’s residents. The Public Engagement Guide outlines a framework for how the City should conduct engagement efforts through planning processes and establishes guidelines for improving the approach to engage more broadly.<br>**4\. Remove All Police from Schools**<br>Currently, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police only operates within Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS) on an emergency basis when called by PPS, and school resource officers are employed by PPS. While PPS serves as the governing body for all policies and programs for public education in Pittsburgh (not the City of Pittsburgh), I fully understand the need for opportunities to address gaps when it relates to students in public schools. Mental health and emotional support are only a few of the unmet needs of students. Additional staff to support these issues may serve as best practices, and the City of Pittsburgh invites the opportunity to collaborate on solutions.<br>In Pennsylvania, local school districts exist because state law created them. As specified in PUBLIC SCHOOL CODE OF 1949 Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, No. 14 State Law outlines the responsibilities of school districts, and school districts act as localized regulatory agents of the state rather than as completely independent bodies. The City of Pittsburgh is bound to comply with the code of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania concerning policing in Pittsburgh Public Schools. Specifically, PUBLIC SCHOOL CODE OF 1949 - Act of November 27, 2019, P.L. 662, No. 91. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Municipal Police Officers' Education and Training Commission (MPOETC) oversees municipal police training curriculum for all municipality police forces. Any effort to amend these laws would require action by the state legislature.<br>I have advocated and will continue to advocate for responsible community policing models for all local police municipalities. Collaborating with the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, the City of Pittsburgh is committed to employing strategies, examining policies, and developing evidence through research to reduce implicit bias, enhance procedural justice, and promote racial reconciliation. These are all in addition to the curriculum from the MPOETC.<br>Additionally, I want to further partner in positive ways with Pittsburgh Public Schools. I fully support wrap around services being provided in our schools and partnering on these support services outside of school time. As Mayor, I partnered with PPS to create a Public Safety CTE program at Westinghouse and want to see that program expanded. Also, during my administration, for the first time ever, the City took money from the operating budget and allocated to enhancements to pre-k in our city. I am supportive of and committed to the implementation of universal high quality pre-k.<br>I am committed to the continued growth of and support of student's literacy through the partnership and efforts of the Dolly Parton Imagination Library. The Dolly Parton Imagination Library is a free program for any child who lives in the City of Pittsburgh age 0-5 to receive one book a month in the mail until their fifth birthday. When they turn five, they will have their own library of up to 60 books. Since the launch in February 2019 with support from the Benter Foundation, the program has grown to include over 3,200 local children and recently sent its 30,000th book.<br>I will continue to support the emotional and long-term unmet needs of students and families. At the end of 2018, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded a total of $1.5 million to housing authorities in Pittsburgh, Chester, and Bucks County for the Family Unification Program (FUP) _._ It provides rental assistance to parents being separated from their children or to those who are at risk of separation. Additionally, this funding is used to help provide stable housing for young adults (ages 18-24) who have aged-out of the foster care system.<br>**5\. Make All Collective Bargaining with Police Public**<br>Pennsylvania’s Act 111 of 1968, The Policeman and Fireman Collective Bargaining Act, presents significant challenges to the City of Pittsburgh’s ability to create greater transparency and accountability. Rather than providing an open and transparent process, Act 111 mandates binding arbitration to resolve disputes and settle contracts, thus providing an unelected arbitration panel, rather than democratically elected officials, with final say on compensation, working conditions, and conditions of employment. Act 111 has never been amended since its passage more than fifty years ago. <br>Without meaningful Act 111 reform in Harrisburg, adverse arbitration decisions will continue to hinder the City of Pittsburgh’s efforts around building a more transparent and accountable police bureau. I have urged State Legislators to amend Act 111 in order to limit the scope of bargaining over disciplinary procedures or specifically limit a labor arbitrator's authority to modify or overturn disciplinary action taken by the Bureau in the interest of public safety, trust, and accountability. In addition, I have called for Act 111 to be amended to adopt the "public policy exception," which would enable cities to challenge an arbitrator's decision to return an officer to work on the basis that their continued employment is adverse to the public interest. All other public sector unions, save for those under Act 111, are subject to this exception. These changes must take place in Harrisburg, and I will continue to advocate for these critical Act 111 reforms and lend my support to corresponding legislative efforts.<br>I understand that transparency and accountability are critical to establishing the community trust needed to advance meaningful reform. To that end, I plan to have the City of Pittsburgh continue to compile and report data on all use of force incidents involving the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. In addition, I will support the release of requested records where legally permissible.  While the process to release this information will be informed by legal restrictions and other reasonable considerations, my administration will continue to engage with you and the broader public to ensure accountability and transparency.   <br>**6\. Terminate the Pittsburgh FOP President**<br>The City of Pittsburgh’s ability to terminate any employee is governed by civil service statues, state law, and federal law.<br>Also under state law, officers can generally only be de-certified for misconduct if they are found guilty of criminal charges. Without the necessary state-led reforms, the City of Pittsburgh is limited in our ability to hold officers accountable and terminate their employment in the public interest. <br>In addition to Act 111 reforms, I have called on state lawmakers to amend the Confidence in Law Enforcement Act to expand the circumstances under which employers are required to terminate officers engaged in misconduct. I have also called for giving the Municipal Police Officers’ Education and Training Commission (MPOETC) more authority to revoke certifications from officers and the ability to review use-of-force complaints to suspend or revoke certifications. I will continue to advocate for these reforms and support corresponding legislative efforts at the state level as they are critical to ensuring accountability from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.<br>**7\. Disband All Private Police Departments**<br>In Pennsylvania, the establishment and regulation of private police departments operating within the borders of the City of Pittsburgh lies with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Title 22 Pa.C.S.A. Detectives and private police and 22 Pa. C.S.A. Private Detective Act of 1953). While the City of Pittsburgh has no authority in the regulation of private police departments, I will strongly advocate for responsible community policing models and accountability for all police departments. <br>This is also a moment to partner with SEIU to make sure their building security officers are given the proper training they need. I was proud to help lead the effort on legislation to provide proper training requirements for our building guards so that they can provide greater assistance to the public without calling public safety. Sadly, the courts struck down our legislation, but I will continue to work with SEIU on new efforts and solutions.<br>**8**. **End “No Knock” Warrants**<br>Breonna Taylor, whose life was tragically cut short, was killed by an officer utilizing a “No Knock” Warrant. I agree that this dangerous practice harms both the officer and residents on the other side of the door. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police does not currently engage in “No Knock” Warrants or plan to implement this practice in the future. <br>I share your outrage in the death of Ms. Taylor, a trained emergency medical technician and a hero who continually fought to provide relief for those in their darkest moments. Like her, we need to console one another and fight for the good among us. Her memory requires us as a community to engage in tough conversations that will lead to a more just future.  <br>**9\. Cease Partnership with ICE**<br>Per Chief’s Order 11-3 entitled “Unbiased Policing Policy,” which went into effect in 2014 and is still in effect today, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police does not cooperate, share information, or coordinate with the United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unless there is a federally mandated court order. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police does not currently ask for any information or documentation associated with a person’s immigration status. The City is willing to provide assistance to any other municipal police department wishing to implement similar practices.<br>The City of Pittsburgh abides by all of the provisions of sanctuary city status. We work through our authority as a City to protect our rights to stand with our immigrant communities. This includes filing amici briefs with the courts with our partners at the National League of Cities and other mayors to stop the DOJ from requiring ICE cooperation as a prerequisite for grants. In fact, the City has turned down DOJ grant money because have refused to sign statements committing to ICE cooperation.<br>Beyond protecting Pittsburgh’s immigrant families from ICE, I have worked to create the conditions for our immigrant neighbors to thrive within the City of Pittsburgh. In May 2014, I launched the Welcoming Pittsburgh initiative with input from over 3,000 community members, and direction from the diverse and distinguished 40-person Advisory Council. This input provided the basis for the Welcoming Pittsburgh Plan, which today, is a living document used by my office and the wider welcoming community to improve the lives of all immigrants, create more informed, diverse, and welcoming experiences throughout our city, and ensure Pittsburgh is most livable for all. <br>Recommendation #27 of the Welcoming Pittsburgh Plan instructs us to “commit to a community policing approach.” As a result, my office has worked with the Department of Public Safety to establish the Multicultural Liaison Unit. The unit aims to increase trust and reliance of Public Safety employees within immigrant and refugee communities through cooperation with the Welcoming Pittsburgh Steering Committee, comprised of community and civic leaders. This goal is also guided by 3 major initiatives: communication and language access, outreach and education, and multicultural training. One critical element of the multicultural training initiative, which will be implemented under the guidance of the Multicultural Liaison Unit is cultural competency training for law enforcement and first responders. These cultural competency trainings are now in the works and are designed to build sustainable and trustworthy relationships between the Department of Public Safety and these under-represented communities. <br>In addition, Multicultural Overviews will be designed for each of the 6 Police Zones to provide information on the various immigrant and refugee communities populating that zone. These overviews have the objective of increasing our officers’ understanding and respect and ensuring an appropriate cultural response when responding to the needs of our immigrant and refugee neighbors.<br>**10\. End Cash Bail**<br>I recognize that cash bail (and other punitive measures) disproportionately harm people who are poor and those who are experiencing homelessness. I believe it is an inequitable system, perpetuating harm and structural violence. While the City itself does not have agency over bail, which is at the discretion of separately elected presiding judges and guided by state laws, I support the allocation of services to individuals who are involved in the criminal justice system to mitigate future engagement and harm.<br>The City will address criminal justice system engagement through diversion and the issuance of summons in place of arrests where appropriate. In partnership with Foundation of HOPE, the Buhl Foundation, Dollar Bank, the Pittsburgh Foundation, juvenile probation, magisterial district judges, and the Housing Authority City of Pittsburgh, Zone 1 police implemented the county’s first youth diversion program and is focused on expanding youth diversion citywide. The City is working in partnership with Allegheny County and surrounding municipalities to develop and implement harm reduction-based, pre-arrest diversion programs focused on providing robust support to individuals who have had previous engagement with the criminal justice system. This work is critically important due to the disproportionate arrest rate of Black residents in our city, state, and country.<br>It will continue to be our priority to focus on working with our communities to intervene before the criminal justice system. We will continue to put significant resources every year towards our Group Violence Intervention work. This coordination with local non-profits and street outreach workers is one of the keys to our continued success in lowering violent crime in the City over the past several years. These partners provide economic opportunity to our youth, reach out when crimes have occurred to prevent retaliation, and mentor our youth about career opportunities.<br>It is within the City’s purview to lower arrests through diversion and support of community programs.  Through the development of the City’s Office of Community Health and Safety and with partnerships to expand homeless street outreach and to develop co-responder models, I am focused on reducing the number of arrests related to homelessness/housing instability, sex work, substance use, mental health, and offenses associated with poverty. These critical communities have been disproportionately harmed, and I recognize that it is long past the time to address these inequities.<br>**11\. Release All Vulnerable Individuals from Jail**<br>While management and oversight of the Allegheny County Jail (ACJ) and criminal justice functions, including courts, District Attorney’s Office, Public Defender’s office, probation parole, justice-related services, pretrial services, and discharge, are all within the purview of Allegheny County and the judicial branch of government, the City is committed to implementing diversion to reduce the population of people entering the jail. Furthermore, the City is committed to expanding the continuum of first responders to meet the needs of people prior to criminal justice involvement and upon leaving the jail. Through the Office of Community Health and Safety, and in close collaboration with the community, Black organizations, and Allegheny County, the City will work to ensure that the first responder is the person best trained and suited to promote safety and well-being. As part of this office and through these partnerships, the City will also work to ensure that first responder engagements initiate communication and increase support for individuals and families. <br>To reduce recidivism upon jail release associated with displacement, substance use, mental health, and poverty, the City is collaborating with Allegheny County, as well as public and private partners, to develop a comprehensive, 24/7 services center and shelter for individuals experiencing homelessness. The City is working to ensure that there is always a place for people to sleep safely and receive health and well-being support. <br>I also support the overall reduction of the size of the prison population in the Commonwealth and supported the closing of Western Penitentiary here in the City. This must be done through meaningful state legislative reform on decriminalization, bond/bail reform, sentencing reform and more.<br>**12. Create an Independent, Fully-Funded Civilian Review Board**<br>Pittsburgh’s Citizen Police Review Board (CPRB) was created in 1997 after the police-involved deaths of Jonny Gammage and Jerry Jackson in order to investigate citizen complaints about improper police conduct involving the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. I personally wrote the legislation to create the CPRB as a Council staff member and lobbied with the community to get the votes for passage. Sala Udin and I remain as the only two elected that have worked with the CPRB since inception. While the agency puts Pittsburgh ahead of the curve on civilian oversight, State-level reforms are needed to boost its effectiveness and impact. I endorse efforts by the Pennsylvania State Senate Democratic Caucus to grant municipal civilian oversight boards the authority to review Police Bureaus’ policies, procedures, orders, and all use of force and police misconduct incidents. This measure would also provide much-needed funding to municipal civil oversight boards, including Pittsburgh’s CPRB. Additionally, I have called on the CPRB to review city actions in recent weeks and to make recommendations on areas for improvement.<br>Locally, we are looking into ways to ensure that the CPRB is fully funded at appropriate levels to ensure effectiveness and bolster community engagement. We plan to work to boost the public’s awareness of this critical agency so that residents are aware, and more importantly, know their rights when it comes to reporting incidents of police misconduct. <br>When I took office, I moved the City’s Office of Municipal Investigations (OMI) from the Department of Public Safety to the Department of Law to boost its independence and accountability when investigating incidents of police misconduct and hired the former chair of the CPRB to run OMI. I also support additional outreach efforts to strengthen the public’s awareness of OMI and its responsibilities under local law. <br>I also support Allegheny County Council’s efforts to create a Civilian Police Review Board and I endorse efforts in the Pennsylvania State Legislature that would require every county throughout Pennsylvania to create a Civilian Police Review Board. <br>\\_\\_\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<br>Finally, I would like to end with a personal note. The demands you listed, and your overall sense of engagement, fills me with pride and hope for Pittsburgh. I have worked shoulder to shoulder with generations of Black Pittsburgh leaders, and today I am marching with their children and grandchildren. Like me, you are building upon hard-won civil rights movements of the past and urgently working to make a better Pittsburgh for the future. Together we can advance racial equity and justice, dismantle inequity, increase trust between the community and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, address the unmet needs of Pittsburgh's Black and Brown communities, and lend our voices to advocate for systemic change at all levels of government. Thank you.<br>Sincerely,<br>**![Mayor Peduto Signature](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10170_shhhhh.png)**<br>**William Peduto**<br>**Mayor of Pittsburgh** | 22/6/2020 18:33:58 |

| Mayor William Peduto's Public Schedule - Tuesday, June 23, 2020 | _No public events scheduled_ | 23/6/2020 08:31:10 |
| Final 10-Year Bike(+) Plan Released and Pittsburgh Moves Toward Rapid Implementation | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 23, 2020) After five years of development and consultation with hundreds of local stakeholders across scores of neighborhoods, today the City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure released the final 2020 10-year “Bike(+) Plan.” This guiding document updates and extends the network that began twenty years ago with adoption of the city’s last 10-year bicycle master plan in 1999.<br>“Now more than ever, we need resiliency and safety in our transportation network,” said Mayor William Peduto, “People on bicycles, people in vehicles, and people on foot all benefit from a complete network that logically accommodates travelers of all modes.”<br>To aid in rapid implementation of these safety facilities, today the city and partner organizations also launch “ [MoveForwardPGH](https://moveforwardpgh.org/)” — a public awareness initiative focused on community engagement surrounding these infrastructure improvements that will help all roadway users get around easier, safer, and with less confusion.<br>[The Bike (+) Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan) increases network connectivity and expands affordable transportation access to jobs, groceries, schools, frequent transit and other critical destinations. It nearly doubles the existing non-motorized network by adding 120 more miles of trails, bicycle lanes, traffic-calmed streets known as “neighborways,” and other street improvements safe for travel by bicycle for people of all ages and abilities. Looking beyond conventional pedalcycles, the strategy anticipates emerging demands of newer forms of personal mobility such as pedal-assist bicycles, motorized scooters, and other micromobility devices. <br>For more information on the 2020 Bike (+) Plan and the Move Forward campaign visit [https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan) and [https://moveforwardpgh.org/](https://moveforwardpgh.org/).<br>[![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10173_Bike(+)_Plan_Cover.jpeg)](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/bikeplan) | 23/6/2020 10:10:55 |

| City Youth and Education Manager Named to Inaugural National League of Cities Fellows Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 24, 2020) Tiffini Simoneaux, Youth and Education Manager in Mayor William Peduto’s Office of Equity, has been named an inaugural member of the National League of Cities Institute for Youth, Education and Families ( [NLC YEF Institute](https://www.nlc.org/program-initiative/institute-for-youth-education-and-families)) Early Childhood Municipal Fellows program.  <br>Over the next 18 months, the NLC YEF Institute will equip fellows with the knowledge and skills to navigate the political landscape and leverage municipal policies and practices to help address longstanding inequities embedded in local government institutions that have been exacerbated by COVID-19 and highlighted by recent political uprisings.  <br>“By building a network of local leaders and investing in their development, we will work to ensure that the success of every young child is at the center of local government decision-making,” said Tonja Rucker, Director of Early Childhood Success at the National League of Cities. “Local governments are centers of innovation and the work of our fellows, supported by our YEF experts, will move our country forward in creating communities where every child succeeds, and all families thrive.” <br>Mayor Peduto is a past Chair of the YEF and served on the board of the NLC. <br>"Our administration believes deeply that high quality early childhood education lays the foundation for a child's future success,” Simoneaux said. “The Early Childhood Municipal Fellows program will help me to learn alongside municipal leaders and experts from around the country and to better inform the work that our office does with young children and families."  <br>This is the first fellowship program for the NLC YEF Institute and is an integral part of the Institute’s national efforts to support leaders and build thriving communities that work for children and families beginning prenatally. The fellowship is a leadership development and peer learning program that aims to accelerate local leaders' ability to serve as champions for young children and families. Fellows will delve into key fundamentals that are the bedrock of impactful municipal policy for early childhood success: embedding equity in how business is done; policy and practice evaluation; the examination of local leadership and governance structures; collaboration across departments; the alignment of city, county and state objectives; and the financing and resourcing of programs and services. <br>In addition to Simoneaux, the fellows selected for their exemplary leadership and work in early childhood within their communities are:  <br>- Sara Baray, Chief Executive Officer, Pre-K 4 SA, City of San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas <br>- Risha Berry, Assistant Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, School of Education: Department of Educational Leadership/Institute for Inclusion, Inquiry and Innovation: Urban Education & Family Urban Education & Family Transdisciplinary Core, Richmond, Virginia <br>- Graham Dobson, Senior Policy Analyst, Office of Early Care and Education, San Francisco, California <br>- Ariel Ford, Deputy Administrator, Office of Early Learning, Chattanooga, Tennessee <br>- Erica Johnson, Education Policy Advisor, Mayor Durkan’s Office, City of Seattle, Seattle, Washington <br>- Coral Manning, Early Care and Education Manager, Division of Community Development, City of Madison, Madison, Wisconsin <br>- Kyra Mungia, Deputy Director of Education, Office of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, Oakland, California <br>- Tony Peyton, Program Director, C.E. and S.

| Filling the Gap: City Constructs Final Segment Linking Great Allegheny Passage to Point State Park | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 25, 2020) This week, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure initiated construction on the final segment of the “GAP to the Point” project. The project provides enhanced on-street bicycle accommodation extending the nationally renowned Great Allegheny Passage multiuse trail to Pittsburgh’s iconic Point State Park by way of the Central Business District.<br>This final leg will not only provide vital safety improvements to the more than 1,100 daily downtown bicycle commuters, but will also provide a safe continuous connection from the heart of Pittsburgh to downtown Washington, DC for the thousands of national visitors each year that complete the GAP ride between these two great cities.<br>This final segment extends from Stanwix Street at Third Avenue to Stanwix at Penn Avenue, then extending to Commonwealth Place and Liberty Avenue. The project provides a two-way cycle track and enhanced bus transit stop. The project includes bituminous milling and resurfacing, concrete pavement restoration, new curb ramps, curb and sidewalk repair, signing and pavement markings, associated signal upgrades and other improvements. <br>Construction began this week and will take approximately five months to complete. Hours of work are Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Lane restrictions may occur maintaining, at a minimum, alternating lanes of through traffic.<br>The “GAP to the Point” project is a $927,000 federally-funded transportation enhancement. This phase comprises $758,000 of construction.<br>For more information on the project, please contact the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure at [DOMI@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:DOMI@pittsburghpa.gov) and see the project fact sheet at [https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7875\_GAP\_to\_the\_Point\_12\_03\_19.pdf](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7875_GAP_to_the_Point_12_03_19.pdf) | 25/6/2020 15:21:25 |
| EMS Encourage Safe Swimming and Distribute Free Life Vests to Youth | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 25, 2020) Members of the Department of Public Safety Emergency Medical Services (EMS) will be distributing youth-sized personal flotation devices (life vests) and safe swimming information packets to youth and parents at three of the city’s [summer lunch grab-and-go locations](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4047) on Friday, June 26.  <br>The Safe Swim Initiative, led by EMS, aims to reduce risk for youth who may be pursuing swimming options this summer where lifeguards may not be present like home pools, private pools, or open water. Pittsburgh River Rescue, a joint operation between EMS and Police and the only certified advance life support for river rescue in Pennsylvania, cites that according to the CDC, unintentional drowning is the second leading cause of death among children aged 1-14, most frequently in home pools. There is an additional racial disparity as Black children aged 5-19 are five to ten times more likely to drown in home pools.  <br>Thanks to a donation of youth-sized personal flotation devices from the UPMC Children's Hospital Safety Center, the initiative will provide the free life vests and educational materials to encourage children and parents to adopt safe swimming practices this summer. The life vests will be available at Ammon, Paulson and Warrington Recreation Centers from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis. | 25/6/2020 12:34:30 |

| Equal Opportunity Review Commission Approves over $23 Million in Contracts to Minority- and Women-Owned Businesses for 2019 | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 25. 2020) The City of Pittsburgh’s Equal Opportunity Review Commission (EORC) reviewed $37,550,814 worth of city and city authority contracts in 2019, awarding 29% ($10,965,246) to minority-owned businesses and 33% ($12,516,061) to women-owned businesses according to its [2019 annual report](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10224_2019_EORC_Annual_Report.pdf). That totals $23,481,307 of city and city authority contracted dollars directly invested in the minority and women business communities.  <br>City contracts saw a 37% increase in contracts awarded to minority-owned business enterprises (MBE) and women-owned business enterprises (WBE) between 2018 and 2019. In 2018, M/WBEs were awarded just under 29% (around $4.6 million) of the total $16 million in contract opportunities. Those totals increased to 50% ($7.4 million) of the total $14,779,942 in city contracts in 2019 as a result of awarding more M/WBEs as prime contractors rather than subcontractors.  <br>"I'm proud to see that the work we've done in [creating the Office of Equity](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=2929) and restructuring our buying plans to promote equity in procurement in conjunction in the [Government Alliance on Race and Equity](https://www.racialequityalliance.org/) are paying off by creating tangible economic opportunities for all,” said Mayor William Peduto.  <br>The City of Pittsburgh is committed to providing fair contracting opportunities for historically disadvantaged MBEs and WBEs to do business with the city and city authorities. The 11-member EORC reviews professional service contracts over $50,000 and construction and development contracts over $250,000 to ensure participation by MBEs and WBEs as well as contractors’ compliance with the City of Pittsburgh’s equal employment goals of employing 25% minorities and 10% women.  <br>After receiving feedback from smaller local MWBEs that there are barriers for them to prepare competitive bids for city contracts due to short notice and not having dedicated or robust procurement staff that larger companies have, the City [launched the Buying Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3678) in February through the [Living Cities Accelerator Grant](https://www.livingcities.org/work/city-accelerator). The Buying Plan provides a four-quarter forecast of contracting bid opportunities for the City, Housing Authority for the City of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parking Authority, Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, Sports and Exhibition Authority and Urban Redevelopment Authority. It is intended to give M/WBEs and other smaller businesses an opportunity to see what bids they may be eligible for over the next year so there is time to prepare their bid or collaborate with other businesses to develop a competitive bid that meets the scope of service. The plan is updated every quarter and is [available on Beacon](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html), the City’s procurement portal.  <br>EORC meetings are open to the public and are held every third Thursday of the month at noon and streamed on the City of Pittsburgh’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/citychannelpittsburgh). | 25/6/2020 11:21:21 |

| New Road Salt Methods Saved Pittsburgh $1 Million Last Winter | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 30, 2020) While summer is in full swing, numbers from last winter show the City saved more than $1 million from new road salt distribution methods adopted by the Department of Public Works.<br>Historically DPW has applied 917 tons of salt for every inch of snow. This year using new technology and a different salt mixture DPW used only 376 tons of salt per inch.<br>Salt costs about $88 per ton, and it snowed 21.7 inches in the 2019-2020 winter season. Previously, treating the roads would have cost the City roughly $1.75 million in materials. Last winter it cost the city $718,000.<br>“From adopting the City’s first snow plow tracker in 2015 to deploying technological and mechanical upgrades to our snow plows, the changes we have made have not only expanded city services and transparency but saved us money too. The technology is already paying for itself and will only lead to more savings year after year,” Mayor William Peduto said.<br>Under DPW Director Mike Gable the department has moved to a more efficient road salt that is effective at lower temperatures and is tinted blue so residents can easily see where it has been applied.<br>New snow-fighting technologies overseen by Innovation and Performance Project Manager Chris Belasco include salt spreaders that are tuned with calibrated application rates, improved reporting tools to show treatment and material usage, and smarter snow removal routes using GPS guidance. The routes are currently being upgraded, improved, and made safer based on driver feedback.<br>The overall cost of the upgrades was $1.7 million. With $1 million in salt savings alone last winter, the upgrades should pay for themselves during the 2020-2021 snow season. | 30/6/2020 12:50:24 |

| Pittsburgh Cosponsors US Conference of Mayors Resolution Calling on Cities to Divest from Fossil Fuel Industries | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2020) Pittsburgh and 16 other cities cosponsored a policy adopted by the U.S. Conference of Mayors yesterday that urges cities across the globe to explore divesting from fossil fuels and invest in climate solutions to support a green recovery and a just transition. <br>Last summer, Mayor William Peduto asked Pittsburgh’s Comprehensive Municipal Pension Board to divest the City’s pension funds from fossil fuel industries and in February the board named a subcommittee to study divestiture.  <br>The policy drive was led by New York City leaders. Officials from New York government, C40 Cities and the Heartland Capital Strategies plan to brief the Pittsburgh pension board’s solicitor on the new USCOM policy before the board’s next quarterly meeting in September. Mayor Peduto [is a member](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3501) of the Climate Mayors Steering Committee, a group of 24 mayors serving to support climate action across the United States. <br>Other cities serving as cosponsors of the USCOM resolution were: New York; Berkeley, CA; San Jose, CA;  Davie, FL; Gainesville, FL; Orlando, FL; St. Petersburg, FL; Honolulu, HI; New Orleans, LA; Beverly, MA; Framingham, MA; New Bedford, MA; Durham, NC; Albuquerque, NM; Portland, OR; and Columbia, SC. <br>The text of the USCOM resolution is below: <br>Supporting a Global Cities-Led Movement to Divest from Fossil Fuels and Invest in Climate Solutions <br>WHEREAS, <br>the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly and drastically altered our collective health, wellbeing, safety, and economic security; and <br>WHEREAS, <br>given the scale of the pandemic’s impact, cities must take new and bold action to accelerate an economic recovery that recognizes our looming climate crisis and the threats to public health and well-being that it will cause; and  <br>WHEREAS, <br>this pandemic has exposed long-standing disparities in our society, much like how the climate crisis will produce greater impacts on frontline communities in disparate ways; and <br>WHEREAS, <br>we as mayors can choose to emerge stronger and more resilient from this crisis with a green recovery that prioritizes clean energy infrastructure, job creation, and environmental justice; and  <br>WHEREAS, <br>a green recovery can put cities at the forefront of ending the age of fossil fuels and pursuing a just transition to a clean energy economy by divesting their investments from  fossil fuels and investing in climate solutions like clean energy, resilient infrastructure, energy efficiency, and a just transition; and <br>WHEREAS, <br>as we consider how to rebuild our economy from the pandemic, we must achieve a massive transformation that rebuilds lives, promotes equality and prevents the next economic, health or climate crisis; and  <br>WHEREAS, <br>divesting from fossil fuels is not only the right thing for the planet but can also deliver better financial returns and underscores the opportunities to better manage and reduce environment and climate-related risks for our cities and pension funds and build more resilient, sustainable cities that grow the green economy and jobs, create better public health outcomes, address environmental injustices, and drive equitable development while reducing the harmful effects and risks of climate disaster; and <br>WHEREAS, <br>mayors across the country have already begun to divest from fossil fuels and invest in climate solutions, demonstrating the impact of strong political will and financial foresight; and <br>WHEREAS, <br>mayors can demonstrate climate leadership by making a commitment to divest from fossil fuels and invest in climate solution, and by calling on other investors, endowments, and foundations to follow suit; <br>THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED <br>that the United States Conference of Mayors strongly urges cities across the globe to explore divesting from fossil fuels and investing in climate solutions to support a green recovery and a just transition. | 1/7/2020 10:40:02 |

| City Joins Mayors for Guaranteed Income, a Groundbreaking Initiative of a Dozen Cities to Offer Direct Payments to Those in Poverty Impacted by Pandemic | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2020) Mayor William Peduto has joined [Mayors for Guaranteed Income](https://www.mayorsforagi.org/), a forward-thinking network of a dozen mayors from around the country advocating for a guaranteed income to ensure that all Americans reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic have an income floor. <br>In the United States, wealth and income inequality have reached historic highs. Nearly 40 percent of Americans cannot afford a single $400 emergency, and rising income inequality is compounded by a growing racial wealth gap. The median white worker made 28 percent more than the typical Black worker and 35 percent more than the median Latinx worker in the last quarter of 2019, and the median wealth of white families is more than $100,000 while the median wealth of Black families is approximately $10,000. COVID-19 has further exposed the economic fragility of most American households, and has disproportionately impacted Black and brown people. <br>"COVID-19 has shaken the very foundations of American life and laid bare the economic inequity that especially affects our communities of color. In committing to policies around guaranteed income, we are proud to join groundbreaking leaders from cities across the country in fundamentally rethinking our economic structures to support and uplift the residents of Pittsburgh," Mayor Peduto said. <br>Founded last month by Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, California, MGI advocates for direct and recurring cash payments to residents in order to build resilient and just communities. <br>Mayor Tubbs based the guiding “guaranteed income” philosophy on teachings by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who said, “I'm now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.” <br>A guaranteed income is a monthly cash payment given directly to individuals, empowering recipients to address their most urgent needs and providing a cushion for unpredictable expenses, external shocks, and volatility. It is unconditional, and is meant to supplement, rather than replace, the existing social safety net. <br>Cities such as Chicago, Newark, and Atlanta have formed task forces to explore a guaranteed income pilot program, typically in conjunction with local philanthropies. Pittsburgh plans to do the same, taking direct action on a guaranteed income pilot while also joining other cities in MGI to advocate for state and federal policy change. <br>Other cities in MGI have already started payments. In Stockton, the city gives $500 a month to 125 eligible residents. Los Angeles provided prepaid debit cards of $700 to $1500 to those whose total household income fell below the poverty line before COVID-19. Compton, California, gives $1,000 to families on food stamps. Jackson, Mississippi, gives $1,000 a month to 20 African-American mothers. <br>The 11 mayors already participating in MGI are: <br>- Michael D. Tubbs, Mayor of Stockton, Calif.  <br>- Chokwe Antar Lumumba, Mayor of Jackson, Miss.  <br>- Melvin Carter, Mayor of St. Paul, Minn.  <br>- Ras J. Baraka, Mayor of Newark, N.J.  <br>- Aja Brown, Mayor of Compton, Calif.  <br>- Eric Garcetti, Mayor of Los Angeles  <br>- Adrian Perkins, Mayor of Shreveport, La.  <br>- Libby Schaaf, Mayor of Oakland, Calif.  <br>- Stephen Benjamin, Mayor of Columbia, S.C.  <br>- Keisha Lance Bottoms, Mayor of Atlanta  <br>- Victoria R. Woodards, Mayor of Tacoma, Wash. <br>The MGI Statement of Principles [is available here](https://www.mayorsforagi.org/statement-of-principles). <br>Mayors for a Guaranteed Income is founded in partnership with the Economic Security Project. The coalition is also announcing a new partnership with What Works Cities, a Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative, to elevate lessons learned and expand best practices to additional cities across the country. <br>A resolution in support of guaranteed income was approved yesterday by United States Conference of Mayors. The resolution calls for the advancement of the following principles: <br>- Advocate for a guaranteed income at the local, state, and federal level. <br>- Invest in narrative change efforts to highlight the lived experiences of economic insecurity.  <br>- Invite all cities to join this effort, and provide technical assistance and funding support for new pilots. <br>The USCM resolution (full text linked [here](https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1LHzJiaCMB-U2CJAfntXxt4BL5ERrOyqFoScNYGrxKCA%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&data=02%7C01%7Cernest.rajakone%40pittsburghpa.gov%7Ce7944b3813a64dc8a8c008d81df0085f%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C0%7C637292264254855487&sdata=Dt%2BFeZjoZf5z5OJ6c%2FJftbtvfxQztgogpnkvpN%2F1iWs%3D&reserved=0)), which was adopted on June 30 at the organization’s 88th annual meeting in Washington, D.C., encourages guaranteed income as a solution to economic insecurity, inequality, and poverty. A guaranteed income is a monthly cash payment given directly to individuals, empowering recipients to address their most urgent needs and providing a cushion for unpredictable expenses, external shocks, and volatility. It is unconditional, and is meant to supplement, rather than replace, the existing social safety net. <br>Biographies of the MGI mayors [are available here at the MGI website](https://www.mayorsforagi.org/who). <br>[![Adrian Perkins](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10351_Adrian_Perkins_-_portrait.jpg)](https://www.shreveportla.gov/509/Office-of-the-Mayor)[![Chokwe_Lumumba](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10352_Chokwe_Lumumba_-_portrait.jpeg)](https://www.jacksonms.gov/departments/office-of-the-mayor/)[![Eric_Garcetti](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10353_Eric_Garcetti_-_portrait.jpg)](https://www.lamayor.org/about)<br>[![Aja_Brown](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10354_Aja_Brown_-_portrait.jpg)](http://www.comptoncity.org/officials/mayor/default.asp)[![Michael_Tubbs](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10358_Michael_Tubbs_-_Portrait.jpg)](http://www.stocktongov.com/government/council/mayor.html)<br>[![Libby_Schaaf](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10355_Libby_Schaaf_-_portrait.JPG)](https://www.oaklandca.gov/officials/libby-schaaf)![Melvin_Carter](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10356_Melvin_Carter_-_portrait.jpg)<br>[![Keisha_Lance_Bottoms](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10357_Keisha_Lance_Bottoms_-_portrait.png)](https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/mayor-s-office/meet-the-mayor)[![Victoria_R._Woodards](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10360_Victoria_R._Woodards_-_portrait.jpg)](https://www.cityoftacoma.org/cms/one.aspx?pageId=10289)[![Ras_Baraka](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10359_Ras_Baraka_-_portrait.jpg)](https://www.newarknj.gov/city-mayor)<br>####  <br>**ABOUT MAYORS FOR A GUARANTEED INCOME**<br>Mayors for a Guaranteed Income is a coalition of mayors who will explore cash payment programs in their cities as a response to COVID-19 resulting in nationwide economic insecurity. The mayors will advocate for guaranteed income programs. Against a similar backdrop of civil unrest more than 50 years ago, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. called for the immediate abolition of poverty, and his economic dream of guaranteed income for all Americans. Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, CA founded the coalition following the success of his Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), funded by several philanthropic organizations, including the Economic Security Project.

If you can, please just stay home. We are at a critical juncture in the fight against the pandemic and letting our guards down, even for a beloved summer holiday, will only make things markedly worse for our families, friends and neighbors. <br>If we all do our part and make the simple sacrifices necessary, we can and will beat this virus.

| Milling and Paving Resumes Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 3, 2020) Vehicle owners are reminded to heed alerts from the City and move their vehicles from streets set to be milled or resurfaced starting on Monday, July 6. <br>The list of impacted streets [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). New streets on the list are all in City Council Districts 1, 2 and 4.<br>This year the City is investing nearly $15.7 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout the Pittsburgh.   <br>Roughly 27 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>As many residents are staying indoors and sheltering in place, the City is making an extra effort to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving [are posted on the DOMI website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/street-resurfacing) and will be publicized through city social media channels.   <br>Residents who have registered to receive telephone alerts from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will receive robocalls if their street is to be paved the following week (residents [can sign up for alerts here](https://srv1.publicnotify.com//pwsa/login.php) or by calling 412-255-2423).

| 24 Local Homeowners Get New Roofs through First Housing Opportunity Fund Roof-A-Thon | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 7, 2020) Mayor William Peduto announced today that the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh’s (URA) Housing Opportunity Fund (HOF) and Wells Fargo’s NeighborhoodLIFT program have worked together in support of a citywide Roof-a-Thon. A total of 24 homes throughout the City of Pittsburgh will receive between $30,000-$35,000 worth of home repairs and a new roof.<br>"We are grateful to the URA and Wells Fargo for their partnership on affordable housing projects in Pittsburgh. Homeownership is a big financial commitment, and we want to be sure our residents have resources to help them afford to stay in their homes and communities,” Mayor William Peduto said. “Thanks to the Housing Opportunity Fund and its first Roof-A-Thon, we have 24 neighbors whose houses and roofs are safer and more secure."<br>Through the HOF, the URA operates a Homeowner Assistance Program (HAP) that provides up to $30,000 in financial assistance to help income-eligible, owner-occupied households with necessary home repairs (code issue remediation, roofing, weatherization, accessibility improvements, etc.).<br>“Roofing repair is one of the largest home repair needs among the households who applied to the HAP program,” said URA Director of Housing Initiatives Jessica Smith Perry. “Back in February 2019, there were so many applicants needing repairs and replacements that URA staff started discussions on how to get as many roofs done at once and as quickly as possible, and that’s how the concept of the Roof-a-Thon was born.”<br>Homeowners receiving new roofs and repairs were chosen based on greatest need.<br>Total cost of the Roof-a-Thon is $733,028. Wells Fargo Foundation provided $125,000, from which the URA allocated $5,000 per household; HOF provided $608,028.<br>The Allegheny County NeighborhoodLIFT program local initiative grants are part of a $3.3 million commitment by Wells Fargo to boost local homeownership and revitalize neighborhoods. A collaboration with NeighborWorks® America, and its network members NeighborWorks Western Pennsylvania and Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS) of Greater Berks, the NeighborhoodLIFT program has created more than 175 Pittsburgh area homeowners by offering homebuyer education plus down payment assistance grants.<br>“Having a safe, healthy and affordable place to call home is essential to help lay the foundation for wellness, dignity, and economic opportunity,” said Tiffany Tavarez, vice president of community relations with Wells Fargo. “The Roof-a-Thon initiative is making a meaningful difference in the lives of City of Pittsburgh residents. With the funding from the NeighborhoodLIFT program, we believe in the importance of helping keep Pittsburgh homeowners safely housed with this effort led by the URA’s Housing Opportunity Fund.”<br>Originally slated to start in April 2020, the Roof-a-Thon was delayed because of COVID-19. Now that Pittsburgh is in the green phase, URA contractors were able to begin construction the first week of June. The URA utilized its existing contractors: McMeekin Contracting; Spanbauer Construction, Concrete Rose Construction (MWBE); and Low Country Building Solutions (MWBE).<br>**Monique Jackson**<br>One of the Roof-a-Thon recipients is Monique Jackson of Sheraden who learned about the HAP through the internet. Her home not only needed critical roof repair, but other repairs as well. In addition to a new roof, work was done to her bathroom on the 2nd floor, new windows were installed throughout, and the basement toilet was replaced, to name a few.<br>Work started on her home on June 15 and was completed on July 1. Low Country Building Solutions was the contractor.<br>“Working with the URA has been a wonderful experience,” said Jackson. “The program has helped me in many ways and without the HAP it probably would take years to complete on my own. I definitely would recommend these programs to others.”<br>Jackson says her next goal is to have a fence put up around her house so that her small children can play freely.

She and her mother moved into their current home 20 years ago after their previous home caught fire.<br>She heard about the HAP program from her neighbors and was eager to participate in the Roof-a-Thon.<br>In addition to a new roof, she had work done to her front porch, new windows installed, new front storm door, and significant mold remediation in her bedroom. <br>Work started on her home on June 4th and was completed on June 15. Spanbauer Construction was the contractor.<br>“Everybody at the URA was nice, professional, polite and just right, said Cheatham. “If it wasn’t for the HAP, I would be penny pinching and not get anywhere close to what I got done here. I just couldn’t afford it. I recommend it to friends, family, neighbors, everybody. It's such a blessing.”<br>Cheatham hopes to get the walkway widened for a wheelchair next and would like to get the kitchen updated. The URA is looking into potential grant funding for these projects. See [roof before and after photos here](https://www.ura.org/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMjAvMDcvMDMvMjFkZ28xY2Y1bV9Sb29mX2FfdGhvbl8yMDIwXzQwMF9Bc2h0b25fQmVmb3JlX2FuZF9BZnRlcl9KYXF1ZWxpbmVfRmluYWwuUE5HIl1d/Roof-a-thon%202020_400%20Ashton_Before%20and%20After_Jaqueline_Final.PNG).<br>As of today, 12 roofs have been completed. The Roof-a-Thon is scheduled to wrap up by early-to-mid July.<br>The URA is hoping to have a Roof-a-Thon in the second quarter of every year going forward.<br>“We’re excited to finally see the Roof-a-Thon happen and want to thank Wells Fargo for being such a great partner,” said Smith Perry. “We hope to be able to help even more homeowners next time.”<br>To see a map of the Roof-a-Thon homes, click [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10407_Roof-a-thon_map.png).<br>To find out more about the HAP and other HOF programs, click [here](https://www.ura.org/pages/housing-opportunity-fund-programs). | 7/7/2020 10:02:48 |

| Pittsburgh Files Legal Responses in Harrisburg Gun Ordinance Case | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 9, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh has signed onto an amicus brief on a suit before the state Supreme Court that would allow gun industry groups to sue cities with gun safety ordinances, even if the ordinances have not been enforced. Mayor William Peduto and members of Pittsburgh City Council also signed onto a separate amicus brief for the suit joined by other advocacy groups and elected local officials.   <br>A gun industry group sued the city of Harrisburg in 2015 saying the city’s decade-old gun safety ordinances were preempted by state law. A Common Pleas Court ruled the group had no legal standing to sue since the plaintiffs had not been cited under the city’s laws, but that ruling was overturned by Commonwealth Court last year. The ruling was appealed up to the Supreme Court. <br>The City of Pittsburgh signed onto an amicus brief yesterday with the City of Philadelphia. The brief with Philadelphia says in part:  <br>“Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are the Commonwealth’s biggest municipalities. Together, they provide city services, administer justice, and ensure public safety for over 1.8 million Pennsylvanians. Respondents’ lawsuit imperils all three of these basic municipal functions.

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on International Student Status | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 10, 2020) Mayor William Peduto issued the following statement today in response to the announcement by the Trump Administration of ICE policy changes regarding the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP):<br>"As we grapple with a global pandemic, the decision to modify federal policies to require international students to take-in person classes to keep their visa status is misguided and callous. These policy changes, rather than improving our national COVID-19 response, would be detrimental to public health, our institutions of higher learning, our economy, and our communities. These newly announced policies represent the continued efforts to chip away at duration of status by the Trump Administration, efforts which hinder the ability of the United States to recruit valuable international talent and further our economy. More importantly, these changes to SEVP policies irresponsibly puts the well-being of our international students in severe jeopardy. <br>Here in Pittsburgh, our international students not only help drive the academic and research excellence of our institutions of higher learning but are critical contributors to our regional economy and our community infrastructure. The story of Pittsburgh’s revitalization lies not only in bringing young people to learn at our world-class institutions, but in encouraging young minds to invest in Pittsburgh and call it home. The economic benefit of international students on our regional economy is undeniable. In our region, one job is created for every two international students enrolled in our colleges and universities. Supporting international students is critical to the well-being of Pittsburgh, which is why our Welcoming Pittsburgh Plan is committed to ensuring access to our exceptional educational resources and promoting international learning exchanges. The contributions of our international students will be critical to a robust economic recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>Beyond their economic contributions, our international students are a vital part of the fabric of our communities. They volunteer their time to support neighbors in need. They lend their voices to movements for justice. They drive forward research and innovation. Pittsburgh is fundamentally shaped by these students and they make us better every day.<br>Colleges and universities should have the autonomy to make decisions about reopening based on independent assessments of capacity and risk, without coercion by arbitrary governmental policy. International students should not have to choose between leaving their new homes and prioritizing their health and safety. I stand firmly committed to working to preserve the ability of our international students to remain in Pittsburgh while pursuing their education." | 10/7/2020 09:31:29 |

| City of Pittsburgh Joins Legal Fight Against Trump Plan to Suspend Student Visas | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 13, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh has joined a suit filed by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology challenging a move by the Trump Administration and ICE to suspend international visas under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. <br>Pittsburgh is one of 26 municipalities nationwide that signed onto an amicus brief in support of the Harvard-MIT suit today, seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the order. Mayor William Peduto [released a statement on Friday](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4147#) denouncing the order. <br>It says in part: <br>“This matter will have a direct and deep impact on amici \[cities\] and their communities. First, amici care deeply about their foreign-born populations (some of the largest in the country) and have a strong interest in protecting the rights and well-being of all students and their families as they seek to complete their higher education in the United States. These interests are reflected in, for example, the adoption of welcoming-city ordinances and policies, the provision of healthcare and public health services to all, especially during the current pandemic, and the provision of funds for immigration legal services.  <br>Second, the international students enrolled in amici’s educational institutions make significant economic contributions to amici’s communities.” <br>[A copy of the brief is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10563_Harvard_MIT_v._DHS_-_As_filed_copy_-_Brief_of_26_cities_and_counties.pdf). | 13/7/2020 12:54:09 |
| Update on Refuse and Recycling Service Disruptions and Front Line Staff COVID-19 Reports | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 13, 2020) Due to personnel issues involving COVID-19, employee quarantine and other injuries, there have been some disruptions in city services most notably recycling collection in some East End neighborhoods as some essential staff have been unable to work.  <br>Last week, several neighborhoods reported missed recycling and refuse collection due to limited staffing. The Department of Public Works’ Environmental Services asks all residents whose recycling or refuse hasn’t been collected to leave it at the curb where it is usually picked up until our crews are able to pick it up. Residents are asked to review the [refuse and recycling rules and regulations](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/waste-regulations) and [tips for keeping our Environmental Services workers safe](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/protect-refuse-workers). <br>Since the increase in the number of residents staying at home starting in March, the amount of refuse and recycling has expanded creating a much greater workload for environmental services workers. In April, environmental services reported an increase of 506.9 tons of solid waste (8,522.56 tons total) and 40.08 tons of recycling (1,280.04 tons total) compared to April 2019. <br>“We appreciate our residents’ patience as we prioritize the health and safety of our front line workers,” Mayor William Peduto said. “Our staff in Environmental Services and Public Safety are constantly out working in the field and are more vulnerable to exposure to the coronavirus and potential injury. We will continue to take precautions for their safety on the job to avoid the spread of illness to other staff or the public.”  <br>Environmental Services reports:  <br>2 employees off of work as confirmed COVID-19 cases <br>5 employees off of work from heat-related health issues or illness  <br>15 employees off with other injuries  <br>In addition, the Department of Public Safety reports the following number of confirmed cases in each bureau: <br>Police has 7 employees off as confirmed cases <br>Fire has 5 employees off as confirmed cases <br>Emergency Medical Services has 2 employees off as confirmed cases <br>Both the Department of Pubic Works and Public Safety will continue to utilize employee screenings at the beginning of shifts and work safety guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, Pennsylvania Department of Health, Allegheny County Health Department and City of Pittsburgh Emergency Management Agency. | 13/7/2020 11:23:49 |
| City and AHN to Partner on Support for Those Experiencing Homelessness | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 13, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny Health Network are creating a new model for responding to the needs of those experiencing homelessness, problematic substance abuse and unaddressed mental health issues. <br>The program from the Office of Mayor William Peduto, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Public Safety and AHN’s Center for Inclusion Health will build street outreach community-based teams that will connect people with services, housing resources, and health supports, collaborating with first responders to prevent continued engagement and promote healthier outcomes.  <br>This program is funded by a portion of the "Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act’’ or the ‘‘CARES Act" funds allocated to the City. <br>The funding opportunity, [which was announced April 28th](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3912), was developed in response to longstanding calls from the community and Public Safety to provide more robust supports to individuals with unmet needs in Pittsburgh communities. Often, first responders from Pittsburgh Public Safety respond to calls to address these needs but are not provided with the tools to do so.   <br>“As part of the Center for Inclusion Health’s ongoing commitment to health equity for vulnerable and marginalized populations in our region, especially persons experiencing homelessness, we are extremely grateful to have been awarded this funding. We look forward to working with the City of Pittsburgh to create innovative street outreach models that help mitigate risks posed by the compounding public health crises of homelessness, COVID-19, and social exclusion,” said [Patrick Perri, MD](https://doctors.ahn.org/Patrick-J-Perri), Medical Director, AHN Center for Inclusion Health.  <br>The program aligns with a “Housing First” model, aimed at ensuring that people are able to access housing without barriers, while acknowledging and addressing health as a critical part of stable housing and wellbeing. COVID-19 has resulted in increased housing instability and crises, and as such, we anticipate continued calls to first responders.  <br>The agreement between the City and AHN will be introduced to Pittsburgh City Council tomorrow. | 13/7/2020 15:11:00 |

| City to Join in Anonymous Sharing of Traffic Data | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 14, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Innovation and Performance is set to join two data-sharing agreements, at no cost to the City, that will improve planning and analysis related to mobility, transportation and public works. <br>One resolution is with the app Waze, which will provide anonymized traffic data to City employees to manage congestion surrounding construction projects. Another is with the I-95 Corridor Coalition Traffic Flow Data Program, a regional alliance of transportation agencies, toll collection agencies, and related organizations. <br>The City takes the privacy of residents seriously; accordingly, the agreements do not entail accessing or sharing personal data. The information instead represents aggregated traffic volumes, and incident data is not linked to any of the drivers involved nor those who report it.  <br>Both agreements are being introduced to Pittsburgh City Council today. <br>The Waze data comes via the company's [Connected Citizens Program](https://www.waze.com/ccp), through which hundreds of cities and public agencies are granted access in real time to reports from Waze users on things like accidents, potholes, and traffic slowdowns. The Waze data can also be used to visualize traffic patterns and estimate travel time, helping the City identify roadways that are consistently congested or accident-prone and address such issues more quickly.  <br>In the case of the I-95 Coalition data, the City will be given access to a feed with real time and historical information on PennDOT road incidents, traffic congestion on highways, travel time estimates, lane closures, and weather alerts. This will allow the City to better understand regional mobility issues and place local data in that context. | 14/7/2020 09:01:57 |
| City of Pittsburgh and BOOM Concepts to Create Social Justice Public Art Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 14, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh plans to partner with BOOM Concepts to create a responsive social justice public art program on City-owned properties. <br>[BOOM Concepts](https://www.boomuniverse.co/#about) is a Pittsburgh-based creative hub for artists. Through the proposed program with Mayor William Peduto’s office and the Department of City Planning, BOOM will do a call for artists, help artists monetize their art works and perform a community engagement process on sites and programming. <br>The program is similar to a 2016 effort BOOM led in conjunction with the Andy Warhol Museum and Artists Image Resource called “ [Activist Print](https://www.warhol.org/series/activist-print/),” in which artists created works to raise awareness of contemporary issues and inspire change. <br>A resolution on the program was introduced to Pittsburgh City Council today. The City plans to put $5,000 into the agreement with BOOM and then seek matching funds from local philanthropies. | 14/7/2020 13:43:39 |
| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Trump Administration Rescinding ICE Policy for International Students | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 14, 2020) Mayor William Peduto issued the following statement in response to the Trump Administration rescinding their June 6th U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policy directive regarding the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP):<br>Earlier today, at the start of a hearing for a corresponding federal lawsuit brought by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Trump Administration rescinded federal policies announced last week that would have suspended international visas under the Student Exchange and Visitor Program. The City of Pittsburgh is proud to have joined 25 other municipalities nationwide that signed on to an amicus brief in support of the Harvard-MIT suit. The ICE policy announced last week would have jeopardized the safety and well-being of our international students and caused unnecessary panic and trauma during an unprecedented global pandemic. <br>Pittsburgh’s international students are woven into the fabric of our institutions of higher learning, regional economy, and neighborhoods. We are relieved that this decision preserves the ability of these essential members of our community to prioritize their health and safety and remain in their new home. As we face difficult decisions around reopening, whether it be within our institutions of higher learning or elsewhere, my administration remains committed to the belief that these decisions must be firmly rooted in an effective public health approach. The policies that were rescinded today represented a continuation of harmful efforts by the Trump Administration to chip away at duration of status. These efforts are not only economically misguided but morally wrong. Immigrants have shaped the history of Pittsburgh and continue to shape our city for the better. I remain firmly committed to standing with our immigrant and refugee communities in building a Pittsburgh for All. | 14/7/2020 19:05:23 |

| Highland Park Microfiltration Plant to Reopen This Week, Providing Further Safe Drinking Water to the City | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 20, 2020) After three years of work and more than $14 million in investment, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will bring the Microfiltration Plant in Highland Park back into service this week. The work preserves water safety for some 250,000 customers, with a permitted capacity to treat up to 20.8 million gallons of drinking water per day. <br>The plant treats water from the Highland I Reservoir, which provides drinking water to customers living in Pittsburgh’s eastern neighborhoods, the Hill District, and parts of Oakland. This major investment, which was long a priority of Mayor William Peduto and PWSA leadership, will impact more than half of the authority’s drinking water customers. <br>The MFP was taken out of service in 2017 to meet stricter state water quality standards. Over the past three years, PWSA has made the needed changes to improve treatment methods, rehabilitate the microfiltration system, and provide greater security around the Highland I Reservoir. <br>“The work PWSA has done the past few years to ensure clean and safe drinking water for Pittsburgh residents is nothing short of extraordinary. I commend the authority’s leadership for this work, which is going on while it is also replacing thousands of lead service lines around the city, and thank residents for their patience during all these years,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>“Completing the improvements at the MFP will ensure high quality drinking water that meets or surpasses all drinking water standards for over 250,000 residents,” stated Will Pickering, Executive Director of PWSA. “Reopening this unique and state of the art treatment plant allows us to focus on other previously-deferred critical projects. We appreciate our customers’ patience as our team of engineering, construction and operations experts continues to aggressively modernize our water system.”  <br>The Microfiltration Plant provides the necessary retreatment of water leaving the uncovered Highland I Reservoir before it is distributed to homes. Because the water goes to an open reservoir, it is no longer considered potable water and must be treated again before reentering distribution. <br>This project included adding ultraviolet (UV) disinfection technology to the treatment process. UV disinfection is one of the most effective ways to treat water – when exposed to these powerful light-rays, it rapidly and effectively inactivates micro-organisms such as bacteria, pathogens, and protozoa that may have come in contact with the water. This second layer of treatment, in addition to membrane filtration, ensures the safety, quality, and reliability of our water after it leaves the open Highland I Reservoir. <br>By restoring the MFP, PWSA can better distribute water to its entire service area. With the MFP back in service, PWSA has a redundant water system and can spread the demand for water across the entire water distribution network. This enhances PWSA’s ability to reliably provide water to customers.   <br>The Highland I Reservoir provides potable water to PWSA customers in eleven city neighborhoods and supplies water to secondary storage facilities including the Garfield Tank, Herron Hill Tank and Reservoir, Bedford Tanks, and Lincoln Tank. <br>PWSA is doing the necessary testing and operational preparation to bring the MFP back into service this week. Customers should not notice any changes to service once the MFP is operational. <br>Restoring service to the MFP and the Highland I Reservoir strengthens PWSA’s entire water distribution system. With this redundancy in place, it can turn to other critical water infrastructure projects. <br>The total capital cost of all the direct and indirect improvements to support the restoration of the MFP Facility is approximately $14,500,000.00. Over the next several years, PWSA will invest approximately $312 million for other large system improvements. These “once in a generation” projects will modernize our water distribution system and provide customers with more secure and reliable water services. <br>[![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10626_MicroPlant.jpg)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10626_MicroPlant.jpg)<br>[![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10625_IMG_0095.JPG)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10625_IMG_0095.JPG)<br>_Photos: PWSA_ | 20/7/2020 12:34:00 |

| City to Implement Pre-Arrest Diversion Program for Low-Level Crimes | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 20, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh and CONNECT have been awarded funds to develop and implement a public health-focused, pre-arrest diversion program for people who commit low-level crimes stemming from behavioral health issues, including those whose crimes are related mental health and poverty as well problematic substance use.  <br>The funds are from the Allegheny County Health Department's Overdose Data to Action CDC grant and will directly align with the City's public health focus in the new Office of Community Health and Safety. Legislation accepting the support will be introduced to Pittsburgh City Council tomorrow. <br>This pilot program will: <br>1. Work to ensure that participants do NOT enter the criminal justice system; <br>2. Support people who have high engagement with police (specifically associated with crimes of poverty) and instead refer to social services and supports; <br>3. Be harm reduction-based (i.e., participants have agency and identify goals). <br>"We know that cycling people through the criminal justice system does not improve outcomes. Our goal is to continue to work with the community, county partners, public safety, and CONNECT to interrupt this cycle by implementing public health-informed practices like diversion," Mayor William Peduto said. <br>Zone 1 was identified as the place for the first pilot with the goal of expanding it city-wide (and regionally, in partnership with CONNECT). The Northside is the only place in the county with a formal youth diversion program, which is run by Foundation of HOPE and funded by Dollar Bank, Buhl Foundation, and Pittsburgh Foundation. <br>“Our objective is to understand the strengths of all models to — in partnership with the community — develop sustainable, scalable, effective ways to connect people with durable supports that promote health, safety and well being. We will work to create a public health-driven approach that results in improved outcomes for residents and communities," Zone 1 Commander Christopher Ragland said. <br>Lydia Morin, executive director of CONNECT, said "CONNECT is always proud to partner with our members like City of Pittsburgh, with support from Allegheny County Health Department, to listen and respond to the needs of our community and public safety, and our collaborative works to continue developing public health-informed diversion programs to provide support for the people who use drugs in our region." | 20/7/2020 14:15:21 |
| City to Replace Lowrie Street Bridge in Troy Hill | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 20, 2020) On Monday, July 27, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) anticipates the start of reconstruction on the Lowrie Street Bridge over Rialto Street in Troy Hill. The City is investing nearly $1.1 million in the project, ensuring that this bridge can serve the community for another 75+ years.<br>The existing structure was built in 1972 and in recent years has had diminished capacity and a lane restriction due to deterioration in several of its concrete beams. This project will replace the bridge beams, deck, sidewalks, and railings, restoring the bridge to full load capacity. The project will implement improved safety features for vehicles and pedestrians. The metal stairway connecting Lowrie Street to Rialto Street will be relocated to the opposite side of Rialto Street, providing a direct connection to the Rialto steps without need for crossing the street.<br>The general contractor for the project is A. Merante Contracting. The newly reconstructed bridge is anticipated to be completed in December, 2020.<br>Road closures will be necessary starting July 27 for the duration of the project. Rialto Street will be closed to vehicular traffic with the suggested detour route using Troy Hill Road and Route 28. Pedestrian access along the Rialto Street steps will be maintained throughout construction with minimal disruption for certain activities such as bridge demolition. Vehicular and pedestrian traffic on Lowrie Street will be detoured via Ley Street and Sundeman Street. The Port Authority #4-Troy Hill bus will maintain service while using the detour route.<br>For more information on the project, please contact the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure at [DOMI@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:DOMI@pittsburghpa.gov) | 20/7/2020 09:25:03 |

| PWSA Continues Industry-Leading Lead Line Replacement Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 21, 2020) Since June 2016, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority has replaced over 7,400 public lead service lines and more than 4,700 private lead service lines throughout Pittsburgh. The authority and Mayor William Peduto remain committed to ensuring city residents have safe and clean drinking water. PWSA is on target to replace all lead service in its water service area by 2026. <br>The comprehensive Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) program implemented in 2018 generated the momentum that we are experiencing today. The actions taken by PWSA’s Board of Directors and a change in state law made it possible to replace private side lead lines at no cost to homeowners while replacing public side lines. This incentive to homeowners, coupled with a dedicated lead team to manage and coordinate the work with our customers, provided the ability to move forward with lead line replacements at a steady pace. <br>As part of the 2018 and 2019 neighborhood-based LSLR Programs, PWSA replaced over 6,000 public lead lines and more than 4,600 private lead lines at a cost of $90 million. This includes $49 million in state funding assistance provided by PENNVEST for the 2019 program, which included a $13.7 million grant and a $35.4 million low-interest loan. <br>PWSA has surpassed the number of lead line replacements required by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The 2019/2020 compliance year from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 has been our most productive year. We replaced more than 3,200 public lead service lines – replacing nearly four times the amount of lead service lines required by state regulations. <br>![Required vs Actual Lead Graph](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10644_Public_Lines_Replaced_Required_vs_Actual.png)<br>_(Graphic: The graph of public lead service lines replaced shows the year-to-year comparison of required replacements versus actual replacements. PWSA has consistently exceeded state expectations with the 2019/2020 compliance year being our most productive year yet.)_<br>Going forward, PWSA will replace lead service lines in conjunction with water main replacement projects taking place across Pittsburgh. Additional PENNVEST funding, totaling $65 million, will support the replacement of over 15 miles of aging distribution pipes and more than 2,000 service lines throughout the city in 2020 and early 2021. This approach is a more efficient way to replace lead lines, and we will continue to implement these projects for years to come. <br>Elements of the lead line replacement program will remain the same. PWSA focused its neighborhood-based lead line replacement program by using community-based data to prioritize the most vulnerable neighborhoods. Prioritization was based on blood lead levels in children and the concentration of children under six years old as well as women of child-bearing age. It also included income levels of the neighborhood and the presence of lead service lines. We will continue to use this prioritization model in selecting our areas for water main replacements going forward.<br>Additionally, PWSA's lead team will continue to manage and oversee the coordination with residents. They ensure residents are aware of the process, have completed the necessary agreement to allow us to replace private side lead service lines, and know what to do before and after construction. PWSA’s construction contractors will continue the successful use of trenchless methods to replace private lead service lines, minimizing construction impacts on our customers. <br>The Community Lead Response Advisory Committee remains active in advising PWSA on the procedures developed to provide transparency to community members. The authority is also implementing affordability programs that will help low-income customers remove lead service lines from their homes at no cost.<br>"Our Community Lead Response programs go over and beyond to protect the health and safety of our customers," stated Will Pickering, PWSA's Executive Director. "With each lead line we replace, we are reducing potential exposure to lead, and improving service reliability. This project is a priority for PWSA and our community, so we won't stop until this work is complete."<br>"PWSA has made tremendous strides though its lead line replacement program, doing even more work than what is required by the state. That is a testament to how seriously Pittsburgh has tackled this issue, and how hard we will continue to work for years to come," Mayor Peduto said.<br>For more information about Community Lead Response, please visit [http://lead.pgh2o.com/](http://lead.pgh2o.com/). | 21/7/2020 12:49:21 |

| City of Pittsburgh Awarded Over $4.6 Million in Grants to Date for 2020 | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 31, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh has been awarded $4,636,819 in grants from federal and state agencies and national and local foundations so far in 2020. Grant monies are being used to support specific projects and ongoing programs and services.  <br>Grant funding is awarded for projects that specifically support the funding government agency or foundation’s purposes or values. The money is often used as a supplement to the city’s investment in programs or projects.  <br>“As we are preparing for a deficit of over $115 million in our 2020 city budgets, grant funding opportunities are critical to adding additional financial support for ongoing work in our neighborhoods and communities. We will have tough budgetary decisions to make for 2021, but we are grateful for the support from our federal, state and foundation partners to ensure that our residents will continue to see community investment and programs,” Mayor William Peduto said.<br>Some of the ongoing city projects, programs and services that the 2020 awarded grant monies will support include:  <br>$132,000 total committed to the [Dolly Parton Imagination Library](https://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/imaginationlibrary), a free program run by the Office of Equity where any child who lives in the City of Pittsburgh age 0-5 can register to receive one book a month in the mail until their fifth birthday. When they turn five, they will have their own library of up to 60 books. The program, which was started in the City of Pittsburgh through the Benter Foundation's five-year sustaining grant commitment, is affiliated with the [national initiative](https://imaginationlibrary.com/) started by music icon Dolly Parton and recently sent its [30,000th book to local children](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4061). McAuley Ministries awarded the program a sustaining commitment totaling $82,000 and the Hillman Foundation provided $50,000.   <br>$400,000 was awarded by the Land Water Conservation Fund for two recreational upgrades in South Side Park that were outlined in the community-driven [South Side Park Master Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/south-side-park). They include a new discovery garden for children of all ages and a boardwalk to replace the stairs currently linking the park to the fields to improve park accessibility. The boardwalk will also serve to connect the South Side Slopes neighborhood to the Great Allegheny Passage trail network, opening the neighborhood and park users to additional recreation opportunities.  <br>$100,000 from the Hillman Foundation to support the Group Violence Intervention (GVI) Program. GVI is a program from the Department of Public Safety and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police in partnership with Operation Better Block. GVI utilizes community leaders and mentors as an outreach team to work directly with violence-prone groups, affected communities and young people to improve public safety, minimize arrest and incarceration, foster police-community collaboration, and change the narrative in neighborhoods that may have felt both over-policed and under-protected.  <br>Grant opportunities are continually monitored, sought and managed by the Office of Management and Budget’s [Grants Office](https://pittsburghpa.gov/omb/grants-office). | 30/7/2020 12:21:23 |

| City of Pittsburgh Continues to Enforce Fair Housing, Despite Trump Administration Move | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 3, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh remains committed to fighting housing discrimination, despite recent actions by the Trump Administration to roll back fair housing rules. <br>The Department of Housing and Urban Redevelopment stripped protections from Affirmatively Further Fair Housing (AFFH) regulations, which are meant to reduce residential segregation, housing discrimination, and unlawful housing practices that were borne out of systemic racism. <br>Despite this move by the Trump Administration, Mayor William Peduto and the Commission on Human Relations (CHR), with the support of the Fair Housing Partnership of Greater Pittsburgh, remain committed to reducing discrimination, and will continue to enforce AFFH regulations as they have since 2015. <br>“This is just the latest move by the Trump Administration to reinforce generations of systemic racism plaguing our communities, in which government housing policy is used to negatively impact black people by not allowing the same opportunities that other neighbors have,” Mayor Peduto said.    <br>“With rising rents nationwide, a shortage of affordable housing, and new housing instability created by COVID-19, we must create just and equitable housing opportunities in order to provide safe housing as a human right, available to all and free of discrimination,” CHR Executive Director Megan Stanley said. <br>The new rule increases the risk of segregation and harmful practices rooted in systemic racism, as practices like redlining continue in Pittsburgh and other communities around the nation. It comes as the Commission has adjudicated 25% more housing discrimination complaints than the previous year, which shows the City needs more, not less, protections and policies in place to reduce unfair housing practices. <br>CHR has partnered with CREATE Lab on Earthtime visualizations on the need for AFFH in Pittsburgh and is now extending these efforts into City Planning and public engagement.  <br>It also formed a AFFH Task Force, which released [a report on fair housing](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5697_AFFH_Report_FINAL.pdf) this spring. | 3/8/2020 11:28:59 |

| City Reaches Contract Agreement with AFSCME Employees | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 4, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh has signed a six-year collective bargaining agreement with American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Local 2719, a union that represents more than 200 clerical and professional employees in various departments. The agreement issues them salary increases and other employment upgrades through 2025. <br>“We’re happy the City is out of Act 47 and we can sit down and collectively bargain for what is a fair and equitable contract for our employees,” said John Galuska, Director of AFSCME District Council 84. <br>The collective bargaining agreement includes: <br>- Salary increases in line with compensation offered by peer cities that support family sustaining wages for the City’s workforce; <br>- Part-time employees will now be paid at the full salary rate for positions instead of a reduced salary rate; <br>- Most new employees will start at the full salary rate for a position instead of a reduced rate that increases with length of service; <br>- Paid Parental Leave; <br>- Paid Safe Leave; <br>- A time donation policy wherein an employee may donate paid time off to another employee who has exhausted PTO for a medical reason; <br>- The City can now run content produced by a third party on its City Channel; <br>- The City can assign overtime to those who hold necessary certifications or licenses to perform the work instead of based solely on seniority; <br>- The City has adapted its bereavement leave policy to account for the restrictions in place due to COVID-19 that may prevent some employees from attending funerals for family members who have died. <br>- The CBA also has changed all gendered pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers) to gender neutral pronouns (they/them/theirs) in an effort to be more inclusive for all gender identities. <br>The term of the agreement is from January 2020 through December 2025. | 4/8/2020 10:33:52 |

| Mayor Peduto Seeks Relief for Local Independent Music and Entertainment Venues | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 6, 2020) Mayor William Peduto has issued a letter to U.S. congressional leadership in support of three bills that would offer relief and support to independent music and entertainment venues and theaters that are in danger of permanent closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  <br>The letter, sent in support of the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), outlines the economic value and contributions of venues and theaters for cities prior to the pandemic. Since the pandemic has shut down live events, it is estimated that 90% of independent venues nationwide could close permanently. The trickle-down of these closures would negatively affect local artists, whom Mayor Peduto previously [supported in getting financial relief](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10877_SIGNED_Mayor_Letter_Congress_Arts_.pdf), who rely on venues and theaters to showcase their talent.   <br>“Our independent venues and theaters aren’t just important because of their economic impact. Art, music and entertainment are historically woven into the rich cultural fabric of Pittsburgh. There’s no price you can put on their cultural value for our neighborhoods and our city, but there is price we can put on making sure they don’t go under,” Mayor William Peduto said. “I’m urging congress to ensure that our local venues are included in and protected by relief packages. They’re what make our neighborhoods great and, frankly, they’re what make Pittsburgh Pittsburgh."  <br>Pittsburgh National Independent Venue Association members: <br>- 3577 Studios, Pittsburgh  <br>- Club Cafe, Pittsburgh  <br>- Don't Let the Scene Go Down on Me!

| Mayor Peduto Names Douglas Anderson Director of Finance Department | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 6, 2020) Mayor William Peduto is appointing Douglas Anderson as Director of the Department of Finance and City Treasurer. <br>Anderson, of Shadyside, has long served as Deputy Controller for the City of Pittsburgh. Mayor Peduto is sending his appointment later this month to City Council, where it is subject to approval. He will take office the first week of September. <br>“Douglas Anderson brings vast experience in finance and government to our administration, and provides a steady hand in a time of great economic uncertainty.

The Department is also the designated tax collector for the School District of Pittsburgh as well as the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. <br>As Deputy Controller and Chief of Staff to City Controller Michael Lamb, Anderson oversaw the implementation of several government transparency initiatives including the creation of [Open Book Pittsburgh](https://www.openbookpittsburgh.com/), a website and searchable database of City of Pittsburgh contracts, campaign finance contributions to candidates running for office in the City of Pittsburgh and database of lobbyists that do business with the City; oversaw the annual preparation of the Popular Annual Financial Report (PAFR); and managed many other roles, including assigning audit work to performance and fiscal audit staff and approving all Controller’s office expenditures. <br>"As Pittsburgh faces the fiscal challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, I am honored to have the opportunity to lead and work with the great staff of the Department of Finance to help the City through these unpredictable times,” Anderson said.   <br>Anderson was formerly an auditor for the Pennsylvania Auditor General and public information officer for the Allegheny County Office of the Prothonotary before joining the City Controller’s office in 2008. He has a Bachelor’s degree in political science from Duquesne University and a Master’s Degree in Public Management from Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College. <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10880_Douglas_Anderson_Headshot.jpg) | 6/8/2020 13:17:29 |
| Milling and Paving Resumes Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 7, 2020) Vehicle owners are reminded to heed alerts from the City and move their vehicles from streets set to be milled or resurfaced starting on Monday, August 10. <br>The list of impacted streets [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule).

Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>As many residents are staying indoors and sheltering in place, the City is making an extra effort to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving [are posted on the DOMI website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/street-resurfacing) and will be publicized through city social media channels.   <br>Residents who have registered to receive telephone alerts from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will receive robocalls if their street is to be paved the following week (residents [can sign up for alerts here](https://srv1.publicnotify.com//pwsa/login.php) or by calling 412-255-2423).

| Statement from Mayor William Peduto on Historic Designation for Shrine of the Blessed Mother in South Oakland | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 11, 2020) Mayor Wiliam Peduto issued the following statement in support of historic designation for the Shrine of the Blessed Mother ahead of its review by the Planning Commission today:  <br>"Today the Planning Commission will review historic designation plans for the Shrine of the Blessed Mother, a shrine located on a South Oakland hilltop overlooking the Parkway East and Monongehela River. This shrine was created by a diverse group of community members from the South Oakland neighborhood in the 1950s and its location offers architectural and geological features that celebrate this unique and diverse Pittsburgh fellowship. The shrine’s highly visible location has historically provided a place of cultural significance those who pass it – including the steel workers working along the river who could look up and see her during their grueling day. Commonly called "Our Lady of the Parkway, the shrine is visible to the tens of thousand of motorists who use the Parkway East daily.  <br>Bernadette Fincke, a family member of one of the shrine’s founders recently said:  <br>‘The Shrine of the Blessed Mother in Oakland should be designated as a historic site as it reflects the qualities that make Pittsburgh so special. Without government or private management or supervision, it was created and maintained by a diverse group of people from all over the city. It has been a place of inspiration, reflection, and spirituality for Pittsburghers regardless or race, gender, or religion. The Shrine has weathered the economic and social changes of the past sixty years with the same resilience that has enabled Pittsburgh to remain a strong, vibrant, and unique community.  <br>As a native Pittsburgher and daughter of one of the founders of the shrine, I can think of no other property in the City of Pittsburgh, that reflects the unconquerable spirit and love of community than the Shrine of the Blessed Mother.’ <br>The Shrine of the Blessed Mother continues to bring together our diverse neighbors and visitors who come from all cultural and ethnic backgrounds for pilgrimage and worship. This site was created by the community, designed by the community, and maintained for generations by the community for the community and deserves protection through historic designation.” | 11/8/2020 10:23:54 |

| City Launches Engage PGH Online Portal for Community Engagement | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 13, 2020) Today the City of Pittsburgh launched [Engage PGH](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/), an interactive online portal for community participation with City projects and programs.  <br>Engage PGH provides a one-stop location to learn more about projects and participate in activities to provide input and share experiences to improve the plans and implementation from the City. City departments will be adding projects to Engage PGH as opportunities to engage open, starting with projects from the Department of City Planning and Department of Public Works. In the coming weeks, projects from the Office of Management and Budget, Department of Mobility & Infrastructure, and development review projects going through City Planning Boards and Commissions will be available for resident feedback and engagement.  <br>Engage PGH opens new opportunities to continue community-informed decisions for City projects and programs. The City has traditionally led engagement activities in person, though those can bring challenges due to accessibility or timing. Our goal is to have more citizens engage in projects by having Engage PGH work in coordination with in-person activities. In addition, input received will be shared after engagement activities close to increase transparency. <br>COVID-19 restrictions have limited in-person opportunities for the community to share their comments, concerns, and ideas. Engage PGH online engagement will allow City projects to continue and programs to evolve to the needs of residents during this time. The site will allow the City to continue to listen to residents and partner with Pittsburghers in decision making.  <br>“I am excited to build on the work from the City’s [Public Engagement Guide](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7843_Public_Engagement_Guide.pdf) by providing online activities and expand access to projects and programs that benefit our residents,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Hearing what our residents need and want guides our work and Engage PGH grows our ability to reach the community where they are.”  <br>Engage PGH exceeds ADA accessibility standards and is translatable.

Finding housing has been a major issue in the city the past several years, and has become even more burdensome with the economic devastation of the pandemic, so these credits are all the more necessary and welcome,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>The redevelopment projects receiving the credits are the following: <br>- **Larimer CNI Phase** III by McCormack Baron Salazar/Allies & Ross Development, for new construction of 37-unit mixed income, mixed use (4,800 sq. ft. commercial space) building on Larimer Avenue @ Meadow Street  building plus 5 townhomes on Winslow Street (total 42 units; 33 affordable) <br>- **Gladstone Residences** by Hazelwood Initiative & The Community Builders, for adaptive reuse and historic rehabilitation of a portion of the former Gladstone School into 53 mixed income apartment units (44 affordable; 9 market rate) <br>- **Garfield Highlands** by Bloomfield Garfield Corp./Gatesburg Road Development, for scattered site, lease to own program on North Aiken, Kincaid, Hillcrest and Rosetta Streets <br>- **Harvard Beatty** by Trek Development Group, for new construction of 42-unit mixed income apartment building to complete Mellon's Orchard South development (32 affordable; 10 market rate units); provides replacement housing for former Penn Plaza residents <br>- **Cal-Bride** by Northside Properties R & S LLC, for new construction of 42 affordable units as replacement housing for final phase of Northside Properties; 30 unit apartment building @ California & Kirkbride; 5 duplexes and 2 detached houses <br>- **Burrows Views** by BCJ Partners II LLC/(Corcoran Jennison/Beacon Communities/HACP), for new construction of 123 mixed income units to improve the economic integration of the Oak Hill community <br>Today’s announcements follow successful affordable housing initiatives by the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Housing Opportunity Fund (HOF). <br>Under recommendations from an Affordable Housing Task Force named by Mayor Peduto in 2015, the HOF uses proceeds from a $10 million annual City allocation to fund affordable housing programs and activities. In 2019, HOF assisted 230 households through the Down Payment and Closing Cost Assistance Program (DPCCAP), Homeowner Assistance Program (HAP), and Housing Stabilization Program (HSP), and created and/or preserved 110 rental and for-sale affordable housing units through the Rental Gap Program (RGP) and the For-Sale Development Program. <br>For information on housing matters please visit the [Housing Assistance Resource Portal (HARP)](https://pittsburghpa.gov/harp/) launched by the City of Pittsburgh in May. | 13/8/2020 14:27:11 |

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Tuesday Evening Protests | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 19, 2020) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement regarding late night protests outside his home in Point Breeze: <br>“I have long defended First Amendment rights to peaceably protest. I strongly believe that Black Lives Matter, that we are in a historic fight for civil rights in this country, and that it is right for people to take to the streets to demand much-needed reforms to policing in our cities. <br>What I cannot defend is any neighborhood in our city — and their residents and families — being disturbed through the night and morning, and a peaceful protest devolving into unacceptable conduct in which residents are being harassed and threatened. This crosses a line that cannot be allowed to continue, causing those committing crimes against residents to face possible legal consequences for their actions. Using protests to create conflict and division, as some are doing, only impacts the ability of others to exercise their constitutional rights safely. <br>I am working to make Pittsburgh a better city for all, and I have condemned and halted the arrest methods Pittsburgh Police used last weekend. I understand that people are feeling fear, pain and anger in our communities, and that some want to take their frustrations out on me. I fully accept that, but I will not accept unjustified actions that threaten neighbors in any part of the city.” | 19/8/2020 11:15:15 |

| Clean Pittsburgh Commission Launches Pick Up PGH Project, Seeks Proposals for Paid Litter Clean-Ups | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 19, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works has issued a request for proposals on behalf of the Clean Pittsburgh Commission (CPC) for the “Pick Up PGH” project to enter into contracts with local businesses or organizations to do regular litter and illegal dumping clean ups over the course of one year in priority areas and pay neighborhood participants for their service. The CPC intends to award multiple contracts for a total amount of $30,000.  <br>Priority clean-up locations will be located in historically underserved communities. Respondents submitting proposals should identify areas by referencing a combination of maps and visual assessments including citizen reports of litter and illegal dumping submitted to the City through its 311 reporting system and using a map of redlined areas. Redlined area maps served banking and insurance providers with an unjust racial lens to identify and systematically deny mortgages to individuals and families of color in specific areas until the late 1970s. This longtime practice contributed to broad divestment in housing and infrastructure and lead to vacant lots, condemned structures, and seldom-travelled alleys that invite illegal dumping.  <br>Established‌ ‌in‌ ‌2005‌ by the Mayor's Office, the CPC acts as a primary ‌resource‌ ‌for‌ ‌addressing‌ ‌quality‌ ‌of‌ ‌life‌ ‌issues‌ ‌in‌ ‌Pittsburgh's‌ ‌neighborhoods‌ ‌through‌ ‌litter and illegal dumping education,‌ ‌policy, clean-ups,‌ ‌and‌ beautification and includes representatives from volunteer, nonprofit, corporate and municipal organizations. The CPC unanimously decided that reinvesting in historically redlined neighborhoods is but one small way to promote racial justice and equity in our City. <br>“Advancing racial equity is a priority in my administration,” said Mayor William Peduto. “The Clean Pittsburgh Commission’s Pick Up PGH further affirms our commitment to serve every one of our 90 neighborhoods equitably. Paying participants for this work will reinvest our resources back into our communities and make certain that the spotless environments all neighborhoods deserve are maintained.”  <br>CPC Co-Chair Rachel Nawrocki said of the program: “We are expanding the CPC’s work beyond sharing information and collaborating with city, non-profit, community organizations for projects. Our values hold that the‌ ‌best‌ ‌approach‌ ‌to‌ ‌neighborhood‌ ‌improvement‌ is‌ ‌always‌ ‌directed‌ ‌by‌ ‌the‌ ‌people‌ ‌in‌ ‌that‌ neighborhood.  <br>We’ve long relied on community organizations and volunteers to clean our neighborhoods, and now we would like to invite them to apply for this new funding to assign value to the work of litter and illegal dumpsite eradication. Pick Up PGH intends to do just that.” <br>The clean ups in priority areas will be done in addition to the regular clean-up work of DPW crews and in coordination with DPW to ensure accountability.  <br>“Even with the Department of Public Works’ daily operations and assisting volunteer efforts through events like the Garbage Olympics, litter and illegal dumping prevail,” said Public Works Director Mike Gable. “Pick Up PGH creates financial incentives to clean up and maintain underserved areas.  We will require before and after photos to allow us to quantify and qualify further investment in keeping our neighborhoods clean.” <br>3 information sessions will be hosted virtually for interested parties, and the frequently asked questions from those sessions will be posted online at the City’s competitive solicitation site, Beacon: [https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/bid-opportunities.html](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/bid-opportunities.html) as RFP20000346. <br>Visit the @CleanPGHCommission on Facebook for details on other initiatives to #KeepPittsburghClean. | 19/8/2020 12:32:12 |

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Police Interactions with Protesters | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 21, 2020) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement regarding the responses of Pittsburgh Police to ongoing protests, and changes he is implementing today: <br>“When I raised my hand and took the oath of office in 2014 my guiding principle was to reform and change Pittsburgh government across all departments and offices, including the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. The overarching goal was to provide safe, inclusive and equal opportunities for every Pittsburgher regardless of race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or immigration status, which is key to protecting the diversity that makes our city so special. <br>I have repeatedly watched interactions between police and protesters that escalated to uses of less-lethal weapons, arrest methods and other actions that I do not support, and which run counter to our common principles. This is not the reform I wanted, and that I continue to believe in today. <br>As a result I am immediately making the following changes. <br>We will be assigning a new Incident Commander to oversee protests, and additionally there will be new seats at command posts for Civil Affairs and Public Safety Community Engagement staff who will make sure that responses to protest activity are not just tactical in nature, but balanced with the essential goals of improving police-community relations and protecting 1st Amendment rights.  <br>We will be assigning a new oversight and command structure for the Police Special Response Teams (SRTs); these units trained in crowd-control methods will not be used as the primary units to respond to incidents and protests, and only dispatched during narrowly-defined situations when absolutely necessary to protect the public health. The use of SRT units at these events will be subject to clear, written guidelines that city officials are working on now, and will be made public once finalized. <br>These guidelines will formalize that jump-out arrests of protesters by non-uniformed police in unmarked vehicles — which I ordered to be halted on Monday — are not permitted. In a related move, all police units will be barred from wearing military-style camouflaged uniforms at such events as well. <br>Police Chief Scott Schubert and I are reinforcing to all officers the need to protect media covering these events. I fully support the unabridged 1st Amendment rights of the press, and I want them to freely monitor activity at protests on behalf of the public. Their presence and coverage are the backbone of transparency, accountability and democracy, and I apologize if that was hindered in any way on Wednesday. <br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, Chief Schubert and I are working together in coming weeks to expand the role of the Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement office to expand their oversight and decision making of the Civil Affairs Unit, police recruitment and other proactive programs the Bureau operates that are critical to reestablishing trust, confidence and positive relationships between police and all they protect and serve. <br>We will be announcing a new position to head this office and report directly to Chief Schubert.” | 21/8/2020 15:25:26 |

| Art Commission to Lead Public Process on Christopher Columbus Statue | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 25, 2020) – The future placement of Frank Vittor’s Christopher Columbus statue in Schenley Park will be considered beginning on Wednesday, August 26, with a discussion at the City of Pittsburgh’s [Art Commission](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/art-commission) virtual meeting.<br>Mayor William Peduto has asked the Art Commission to commence a public process to review the 1958 Christopher Columbus statue – which is owned by the City and is on City property – and to make a recommendation on how he should proceed.<br>“Public art is an essential element of community identity, public history, and evolving culture. It reflects and reveals who we are and what our communities mean to us,” Mayor Peduto said. “As they did with the Stephen Foster Memorial, I know that the Art Commission will take this opportunity to thoughtfully lead the City through this evaluation with the backdrop that the public process is very important.”<br>The Mayor has called for a public process for reviewing the Christopher Columbus statue,  including a Special Hearing with opportunities for interested members of the public to give testimony to the Art Commission and a period of online engagement during which the public can express their opinion and recommend action to the Mayor to leave the statue unchanged, remove it, replace it, or alter it in some way.<br>The Mayor has requested a final report, summary of public comments, and recommendation from the Art Commission regarding the statue once a thorough public process has been completed to inform his final decision. <br>The Art Commission will discuss the Christopher Columbus statue and future public involvement at the Hearing on Wednesday, August 26, at 2 p.m. Information can be found on the [Virtual Art Commission](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/virtual-ac) page. <br>**For More Information:**<br>Sarah Minnaert<br>Public Art & Civic Design Manager<br>[Sarah.Minnaert@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Sarah.Minnaert@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>Andrew Dash<br>Director of City Planning<br>[Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov) | 25/8/2020 12:48:45 |
| Unprecedented Public-Private Partnership Brings Innovative Homeless Shelter to Downtown Pittsburgh | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 25, 2020) Through an unprecedented public-private collaboration, a coalition of corporate, civic and community leaders today unveiled plans for an innovative 45,000-square-foot facility near downtown Pittsburgh that provides shelter and comprehensive wrap-around services for homeless adults.<br>The five-story facility, which will be located on Second Avenue, adjacent to the Liberty Bridge, is the first-of-its-kind in Allegheny County operating as a year-round, low-barrier shelter for adults and their pets. Its wrap-around services will aim to address the complex issues confronting people experiencing homelessness, including addiction, unemployment and physical and behavioral health.   <br>Clients will have access to resources that support self-sufficiency and empower them on their path to a safe and secure quality of life.<br>Today’s announcement is the culmination of more than nine months of research and unprecedented collaboration among the following partners:<br>- Action Housing<br>- Allegheny Conference<br>- Allegheny County <br>- Allegheny Health Network<br>- City of Pittsburgh Office of Mayor William Peduto<br>- DLA+ Architects<br>- Highmark Health<br>- Hillman Family Foundation<br>- Pittsburgh Mercy and Operation Safety Net <br>- PJ Dick<br>- PNC<br>- UPMC<br>“This region always is at its best when we work together, and this project really epitomizes that idea,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “This public-private partnership identified a need and has worked cohesively and collaboratively to put the pieces together to find a way to address this challenge. We are grateful to all of the partners who have stepped up to the plate to advance this project and look forward to even more community partners becoming part of this initiative.”<br>"As a city and a region, we are coming together to focus on eliminating harm and risk to people who become homeless by restoring autonomy — to do so, we must ensure that people do not have to sleep in unsafe situations or be separated from loved ones, prioritize individual agency and dignity, and facilitate rapid connections to healthcare and other services. We cannot accept that the safest place for a person to sleep is under a bridge or that people without homes are somehow less deserving," Mayor William Peduto said. "I am grateful for our many partners and providers, and particularly our direct service workers, for tirelessly working to meet these needs."<br>This $21 million project, the first in which both the public and private sectors were hands-on in the development and design, has been made possible by contributions of $5 million each from both Highmark and the PNC Foundation, plus $5 million of in-kind services from UPMC, ongoing fundraising efforts from local foundations, and countless hours of consultation and expertise from the stakeholder group at large. Key to the success of the project will be the ongoing support services at the shelter run by Allegheny County. Land for the facility was donated by the City of Pittsburgh and the Urban Redevelopment Authority. <br>“Public-private partnerships are at the core of some of the most successful initiatives in our community and represent Highmark’s commitment to creating and growing healthier and more vital communities in the process. That’s why Highmark has committed $5 million to this project and AHN is proud to be a part of the Steering Committee,” said Dan Onorato, executive vice president and chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Highmark Health. “We are a stronger community when we all work collaboratively to address issues and solve problems that impact our region.”<br>“It is particularly challenging to manage the complexities of mental health, poverty, physical health, and addiction, especially when the needs of our homeless neighbors can be so profound. We will serve all with utmost dignity and respect,” said Dr. Steven Shapiro, Chief Medical and Scientific Officer, UPMC. “At UPMC, we hold tight to our mission of making care accessible, and today we celebrate the mission of service that UPMC shares with all partners.”<br>The deliberate approach to planning and design has been informed by best practices and lessons learned from comparable facilities across the country, as well as experts who are addressing homelessness daily and understand specific local circumstances. These experts include individuals representing local health care, government, public safety, human services, NGO and professional services (design and construction) organizations. The vision for delivery of services centers on dignity, personal control, security and privacy, harm reduction, trauma-informed care and flexibility.<br>“As a Main Street Bank, PNC takes a collaborative, market-specific approach to everything we do,” said Lou Cestello, head of regional markets and regional president of Pittsburgh for PNC. “While we are pleased to contribute funding from the PNC Foundation, as well as technical expertise on building and development for this project, we know the best results can’t be achieved without collaboration among local organizations with roots in the community and the infrastructure in place to make the biggest impact possible. We are eager to realize the results of this public-private collaboration. Our goal is to drive meaningful change by providing much-needed services to individuals experiencing homelessness in our own backyard.” <br>“Having a home is a basic need for everyone,” said Linda Metropulos, special consultant for Action Housing. “We might look the other way when we see someone who is experiencing homelessness, sitting on the sidewalk, sleeping in an alleyway, or waiting for a cold weather shelter to open. But when you stop to think about where this person can go at the end of the day when they are exhausted or need a shower or where their next meal will come from, you realize just how hard his or her life really is. While short-term help can be found, long-term solutions will require a community-sized response. This collaborative effort is breath-taking in its scope and an incredible show of compassion and generosity that is needed to truly serve those members of the Pittsburgh community who are most in need. It is an important addition to an existing safety net that is already caring for some of our most at-risk citizens.”<br>Functions and services include the following key components:<br>- Client services, including care for shelter, drop-in and single-room occupancy populations. The case management team will assess the needs and navigate to appropriate resources and supportive services, including a small clinic for physical and behavioral health services as well as alcohol and other drug treatment programs;<br>- Drop-in Center with personal hygiene facilities, laundry, snacks and client services for individuals experiencing homelessness, but who are not necessarily staying at the facility;<br>- 95 beds with room for 42 overflow beds in group sleeping rooms with dedicated personal hygiene facilities, living room and locker storage;<br>- Mail services, important to those without a permanent address;<br>- A singular area to include lounges, a library and computer room, kitchen, dining and outdoor plaza space and seating;<br>- 42 single-room occupancy units to facilitate transition to independent housing; and<br>- Adequate quiet room and support space, workstations and kitchenette for the staff serving this facility.<br>Full design and construction activities are expected to proceed imminently. <br>Progress will be tracked and measured toward outcomes that reduce chronic homelessness in Pittsburgh. <br>**CONTACT:**<br>_Olivia Lammel_<br>_412-952-4880_<br>_olivia.lammel@pnc.com_ | 25/8/2020 12:31:04 |
| City to Allow Allegheny CleanWays Access to City Property to Combat Illegal Dumping and Littering | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 25, 2020) The Mayor’s Office and Department of Public Works (DPW) have proposed legislation that will permit Allegheny CleanWays to remove litter and illegally dumped materials from city-owned properties. This agreement would solidify an existing cooperative partnership between DPW and Allegheny CleanWays and will allow them to go onto city-owned property to remove debris, litter, and illegal dumping without having to obtain the city’s permission each time. The agreement between the City and Allegheny CleanWays will also formalize access to DPW’s Division yards for disposal of the collected debris. <br>Allegheny CleanWays is a non-profit organization dedicated to engaging and empowering people to eliminate illegal dumping and littering in Allegheny County. Since 2000, they have organized 14,124 volunteers for the removal of 30,569 tires and 1,727.3 tons of debris within city limits.  <br>The agreement would allow Allegheny CleanWays to enhance the work of DPW’s Environmental Enforcement Coordinator and Anti-Litter Specialist, who are responsible for the management, investigation, clean up of illegal dumping and littering sites, and coordinating volunteer clean ups. This team has worked collaboratively with Allegheny CleanWays to identify over 900 sites where dumping on city-owned property and privately-owned property regularly occur. <br>“In our work on the seemingly unending problems of litter and illegal dumping, we know that Pittsburgh is uniquely reliant on volunteer efforts to keep our streets, alleys, lots, and waterways clean,” said Environmental Enforcement Coordinator Missy Rosenfeld. “All together these tasks can be such a huge undertaking that we are extremely grateful to have organizations like Allegheny CleanWays getting out there and doing the hard, necessary work that the City can sometimes struggle to keep up with.” <br>“People who illegally dump do not discriminate between privately-owned or publicly-owned property. When privately owned, getting the owner’s permission to clean the site can be challenging,” said Anti-Litter Specialist Chris Mitchell. “Allowing Allegheny CleanWay’s sweeping access to all city-owned properties instead of seeking permission parcel by parcel will speed up the cleaning process.” <br>As part of the City's many-pronged approach to illegal dumping, plans are also underway to update [City Code 601.11](https://library.municode.com/pa/pittsburgh/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=COOR_TITSIXCO_ARTIRERIAC_CH601PUOR_S601.11LIDU) language to better match what is seen in the field: construction and demolition waste, tires, TV’s, furniture, appliances, shopping carts, and more. The update will also include increasing the penalty when violators are caught. <br>“Illegal dump sites degrade the quality of life of the people who live near them; create significant risks to public health and safety; lower property values in communities where they exist; and decrease the overall environmental health of the community,” said Myrna Newman, Executive Director of Allegheny CleanWays. “Allegheny CleanWays has been cleaning up illegal dump sites in Pittsburgh for the past 20 years and we are eager to formalize an agreement with the city to continue this vital work.” <br>Earlier this year, Pittsburgh participated in a [study by Keep Pennsylvania Beautiful](https://www.keeppabeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KPB-Litter-Cost-Study-013120.pdf) to quantify the costs of litter and illegal dumping for nine cities State-wide. The cities studied collectively spend more than $68 million annually on cleanup, education, enforcement, and prevention efforts.  <br>The legislation for this agreement will be presented to City Council today for consideration.  <br>More on the City’s anti-litter initiatives and resident empowerment can be found at [https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/litter-dumping](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/litter-dumping).

| City Serves 150,000 Meals So Far During Pandemic, with Service Continuing at Start of New School Year | **UPDATE (August 30, 2020): With Pittsburgh Public Schools delaying their start until September 8, Citiparks will be issuing food to children at Rec Centers around the city. [Further details are available here.](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4266)**<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (August 28, 2020) Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and through the summer the City of Pittsburgh Department of Parks and Recreation has served nearly 150,000 Grab & Go meals to children and seniors. <br>With the school beginning on Monday for Pittsburgh Public Schools students meal distributions will still be available but will change slightly. Meals for seniors will not change. <br>Total to date Grab & Go meals served to children were 98,951, with 58,913 via Rec Centers and Salvation Army sites, and 40,038 through summer food partner sites. <br>Meals for seniors totaled 48,126, which includes all of the meals provided by the Area Agency on Aging and some, but not nearly all of the meals that have been additionally donated.  <br>More recent meal donations including fresh produce made available via Pittsburgh Police are being delivered to all City senior center locations on Wednesday and Fridays each week. Hot meals are also being distributed one day per week at the Markethouse and Sheraden locations. <br>Altogether that is a total of 147,077 free meals served by Citiparks employees during the pandemic. <br>“Our Citiparks employees are on the front lines just like so many City workers helping Pittsburghers in need. I’m very proud of them and thankful to all the partners who have pitched in to help the past five months,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>Citiparks gathered testimonials from some of those helped during the pandemic. <br>“Thank you so much for making sure no kid went without food or activities during this virus time. My name is Mrs. Terry and I love helping the kids in hopes that one day they will be come respectful and helpful adults. Again thank you for your thoughtfulness.” <br>“The Citiparks lunches were great. My children loved them. They helped out tremendously. . . They really loved the mac & cheese, corn dogs, and cheeseburgers,” Ms. McClintock said. <br>“We all appreciate what has been given to us because I have three grandchildren and I’m on disability and the food I get helps them so, so much! We thank you Kyra and Erin for all you do for our family.” <br>With the school beginning on Monday, August 31, for Pittsburgh Public Schools students meal distributions will still be available but will change slightly. <br>On Monday Citiparks will be moving to the CACFP (Child and Adult Care Food Program) meals for children, as the SFSP (Summer Food Service Program) will end after today. Senior meal distribution will not change. <br>Citiparks will serve meals three days per week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Monday and Wednesday will include meals for Tuesday and Thursday (with the exception of this coming Monday). <br>Under state rules Friday cannot include meals for Saturday as it is not a school instructional day. <br>Meals will include dinner and a snack. Parents/guardians can pickup meals without a child present, but have to sign for the child (as do children if picking up for more than one child). <br>There will be NO meal service on Monday, September 7, due to the Labor Day Holiday <br>Food distribution sites are: <br>AMMON REC CENTER 2217 Bedford Avenue 3-4:30 p.m.  <br>ARLINGTON REC CENTER 2201 Salisbury Street 3-4:30 p.m.  <br>BROOKLINE REC CENTER 1400 Oakridge Street 3-4:30 p.m.  <br>JEFFERSON REC CENTER 605 Redknap Street 3-4:30 p.m.  <br>MAGEE REC CENTER 745 Greenfield Avenue 3-4:30 p.m.  <br>PAULSON REC CENTER 1201 Paulson Avenue 3-4:30 p.m.  <br>PHILLIPS REC CENTER 201 Parkfield Street 3-4:30 p.m.  <br>WARRINGTON REC CENTER 329 Warrington Avenue 3-4:30 p.m. A <br>CH CLEAR PATHWAYS 510 Heldman Street 5-6 p.m.  <br>ALLEGHENY DWELLINGS 171 Belleau Drive (Rear) 2:30-4:00 p.m.  <br>NORTHVIEW HEIGHTS 441 Mt.

| Speed Humps to be Re-installed on Gold Way in Polish Hill | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 28, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is pleased to announce the construction of speed humps on Gold Way from Melwood Avenue to Denver Street. This project will include the re-installation of three speed humps on Gold Way.<br>Permanent signage and pavement markings will be installed to alert motorists of approaching speed humps and bicycle facilities.<br>Work is tentatively expected to begin on Monday, August 31, 2020, and is expected to last one to two days, weather permitting. Hours of construction will be 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Due to the narrow width of Gold Way, vehicles will be detoured to Bigelow Boulevard.

| Milling and Paving Resumes Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 28, 2020) Vehicle owners are reminded to heed alerts from the City and move their vehicles from streets set to be milled or resurfaced starting on Monday, August 31. <br>The list of impacted streets [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). New streets on the list are largely in City Council Districts 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8. <br>This year the City is investing nearly $15.7 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout the Pittsburgh.   <br>Roughly 27 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>As many residents are staying indoors and sheltering in place, the City is making an extra effort to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving [are posted on the DOMI website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/street-resurfacing) and will be publicized through city social media channels.   <br>Residents who have registered to receive telephone alerts from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will receive robocalls if their street is to be paved the following week (residents can sign up for alerts by 412-255-2423). Paving crews will be placing fliers on vehicle windshields 48 hours in advance. | 28/8/2020 09:28:30 |
| Mayor William Peduto Makes Juneteenth a City Holiday | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 29, 2020) At the Black Voting Rights Forum today at St. Benedict the Moor Church in the Lower Hill District, Mayor William Peduto announced that Juneteenth will be an official City of Pittsburgh holiday starting in 2021. <br>The announcement was made at the forum celebrating the 150th year of Black men’s right to vote and the 100th year of Black women’s right to vote. Juneteenth commemorates the ending of slavery in the United States in 1863. <br>“Today, we celebrate those who fought for equitable access to voting – who fought to tell the world that Black people have a voice and that voice is important to helping to shape the future of our neighborhoods, our state and our country.   <br>We also celebrate those who have kept the rich culture and heritage of our Black communities alive and thriving – those such as B Marshall and others, who have passed along the rich tradition of Juneteenth in Pittsburgh every year with the Grand Jubilee of Freeman Parade, which was started in Pittsburgh in 1870.   <br>Today, I’m announcing that starting June 19, 2021, Juneteenth will be a holiday in the City of Pittsburgh by order of the Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh. This follows a resolution by Council President Theresa Kail-Smith commemorating the holiday this summer. <br>Juneteenth reminds us of the rich history of Black Pittsburgh and celebrates those who worked hard so that Black people’s voices could be heard through voting.   <br>Throughout history, many have tried to silence Black voices. We have arrived in a critical time where they are finally getting the attention that they deserve – and they are being heard. Many of us, particularly privileged white men, have not always listened as much as we should have. The time is now to make that change permanent, and formally set aside this holiday to celebrate Black voices." | 29/8/2020 13:49:44 |

| Pittsburgh to Join Nationwide Food Waste Initiative | PITTSBURGH, PA  (August 31, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh is one of ten cities nationwide chosen to be part of the Food Matters Regional Initiative, a program seeking to advance food waste prevention, surplus food rescue, and recycling of food scraps. <br>Legislation finalizing the City’s participation with the National Resource Defense Council (NRDC) program is being introduced to City Council tomorrow. The effort will be led by the Department of City Planning. <br>"The Food Matters legislation will allow the City to continue expanding work to reduce food waste through prevention, food rescue, and recycling of food scraps. These solutions benefit the economic prosperity of the area and decrease pollution caused by waste," Planning Director Andrew Dash said. <br>NRDC [describes the initiative](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/madeline-keating/food-matters-regional-initiative-launch#:~:text=The%20NRDC%20Food%20Matters%20team,waste%20at%20a%) this way: <br>"In 2017, NRDC, with support from The Rockefeller Foundation, released a duo of [Food Matters reports](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/food-matters-what-we-waste-and-how-we-can-expand-amount-food-we-rescue) that estimated quantities and types of food wasted and opportunities to expand food rescue in three U.S. cities—Denver, Nashville, and New York City. Key findings included that two-thirds of food thrown out at the residential level could have been eaten, and there is a substantial amount of surplus food throughout city sectors. These findings led us to develop a [toolkit of policies and programs](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/tackling-food-waste-cities-policy-and-program-toolkit) for cities to tackle food waste.   <br>. . . Our in-depth work with Nashville, Denver, and Baltimore provided us the opportunity to test many of our strategic approaches and [develop additional tools](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/darby-hoover/building-out-food-matters-toolbox-new-food-waste-tools) to help prevent food from going to waste, rescue surplus food, and recycle food scraps, including implementing [Mayoral restaurant challenges](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/food-waste-restaurant-challenge-guide), [training health inspectors](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/health-inspector-training-food-donation-guide) to advocate for food waste strategies, and deploying our [Save the Food consumer education assets](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/increasing-public-awareness-about-food-waste-prevention-guide). Some of the lessons learned during this work included the importance of a systems approach, including building cross-agency teams and [engaging local partners](https://youtu.be/pfxpDZ2l5ig)."   <br>There is no cost to the City for entering the program. <br>City Planning is working closely with its local partner, Sustainable Pittsburgh. Staff from both Sustainable Pittsburgh and City Planning (Shelly Danko+Day and Rebecca Bykoski) attended the Food Matters Cities Summit in Denver in November where they were inspired by NRDCs work in Baltimore, Nashville, and Denver. This program will help the City learn from these forward thinking cities as Pittsburgh navigates towards its Climate Action Plan 3.0 Zero-Waste goals. | 31/8/2020 13:45:51 |

| Department of City Planning Announces Comprehensive Planning Process | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 1, 2020) Today the City of Pittsburgh Department of City Planning announced the beginning of a citywide comprehensive planning process, ForgingPGH. <br>“ForgingPGH is the first comprehensive look at land use citywide and will guide future growth and development. The plan will provide an equitable framework for housing, development, mobility, sustainability and land use for the next 20 years,” said Andrew Dash, director of the Department of City Planning. <br>[The Conditions and Trends Report](https://forgingpgh.org/building-our-plan/conditions-and-trends-report/), also released today, outlines where the City of Pittsburgh has been and where the City is now. The report identifies inequalities that have come with previous development in the City and the uneven growth across Pittsburgh. This data will inform ForgingPGH, in which the City will take a people-based approach to land use. <br>“With our people and our planet at its center, ForgingPGH guides planning and development for the City of Pittsburgh through a shared vision for the future,” said Mayor William Peduto. “This community-driven plan, with equity at its foundation, will continue to make Pittsburgh a place for all.”<br>The data presented in the report helped to inform the development of the [Data Visualization Tool](https://forgingpgh.org/tools-and-resources/data-visualization/) which allows residents to view data and maps at the citywide and neighborhood level. In addition to the Conditions & Trends Report, ForgingPGH will be guided by the [p4 framework](http://www.p4pittsburgh.org/), the [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/), and the Displacement Vulnerability Index. The Conditions & Trends Report and the data visualization tool, along with more information about the planning process and upcoming events, are available at [ForgingPGH.org](https://forgingpgh.org/). <br>The first opportunity for community involvement is an online scenario planning workshop that includes a survey and an interactive map activity. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, engagement activities for ForgingPGH will start online on [Engage PGH](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/) to keep our communities safe and healthy. The workshop can also be completed by calling 3-1-1 or by visiting [open Carnegie Library locations](https://www.carnegielibrary.org/reopening/#inlibrary). <br>COVID-19 has had significant impacts on our region and our City. While the ForgingPGH planning process develops a plan for the next twenty years, it will account for those impacts and meet residents where they are at this time to help prepare and build for a future of growth and opportunity. <br>In addition, the Department of City Planning will release Requests for Proposals for Economic Development and an update to the Housing Needs Assessment, which will be elements of the Comprehensive Plan. These opportunities will take into consideration the impacts of COVID-19 and inequities in access. Both will be available on [Beacon](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html).<br>**For More Information:**<br>Anthony Kobak<br>Project Manager, Senior Planner<br>[anthony.kobak@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:anthony.kobak@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>Andrew Dash<br>Director, Department of City Planning <br>[andrew.dash@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:andrew.dash@pittsburghpa.gov) | 1/9/2020 11:51:16 |
| Pittsburgh Joins Fight Against Trump Administration Attempts to Reduce Census Efforts | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 1, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh has joined a large coalition of attorneys general, cities, counties, and the bipartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors in taking legal action against the Trump Administration’s impairment of the 2020 Decennial Census.  <br>Earlier this month, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that it was reducing — by an entire month, from October 31 to September 30 — the time in which self-response questionnaires will be accepted and door-to-door follow-ups by census enumerators will take place. The coalition filed an amicus brief in National Urban League v. Ross, supporting the plaintiffs’ request for a nationwide stay or preliminary injunction to halt this “Rush Plan.”  <br>The coalition argues that this expedited schedule will hamstring the bureau’s ongoing efforts to conduct the census and will thus impair the accuracy of its enumeration of the total population of each state. <br>“Pittsburgh and other cities are faced with being undercounted this fall due to these Trump Administration moves, and we are doing all we can to fight for the full representation our residents deserve,” Mayor William Peduto said.  <br>In the brief — filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California —the coalition of 23 attorneys general, five cities, four counties, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, argue that amici have a direct stake in this dispute, as the decennial census determines the states’ political representation in Congress, provides critical data for states’ redistricting efforts, and affects hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding to states and localities.  <br>An inaccurate census will directly impair those interests, inflicting harms that will persist for the next decade. The administration’s efforts to reduce the time for both self-responses of the questionnaire sent to every household across the country, as well as non-response follow-up operations for those who don’t respond, will inevitably harm the accuracy of the population count.  <br>The shorter time period also flies in the face of what the Census Bureau previously said itself was necessary to conduct an accurate count, as it alters the deadline that the bureau had adopted specifically to accommodate the unique difficulties posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. <br>Such a loss would deprive these states of political power in Congress for a decade, hampering city efforts to serve their residents and depriving them of the representation to which they would otherwise be entitled. The undercount would also affect harm within states since census data is used for redistricting of state legislative seats as well. <br>Additionally, an undercount would affect hundreds of billions of dollars of federal funding that are dependent on the decennial census’s population count. In particular, at least 18 federal programs distribute financial assistance based in whole or in part upon each state’s relative share of the total U.S. population. Numerous other programs distribute funds based off of census data as well. <br>The coalition goes on to argue that the court should not view this Rush Plan in a vacuum. The very integrity of the 2020 Decennial Census is at stake, and the defendants — the U.S. Department of Commerce, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the Census Bureau, and Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham — have all repeatedly attempted to manipulate the census, in multiple ways, under the direction of President Donald Trump by previously attempting to add a citizenship question to the census and by excluding undocumented immigrants from the population count that will be used for congressional apportionment. The coalition highlights that all three of these efforts disregard unambiguous constitutional or statutory requirements, consciously deviate from centuries of consistent practice, and fail to deal honestly with the public and the courts. <br>Joining Pittsburgh and New York Attorney General Letitia James in filing this amicus brief are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. The attorneys general are joined by the cities of Central Falls, RI; Columbus, OH; Philadelphia, PA; and Phoenix, AZ. Additionally, Cameron, El Paso, and Hidalgo Counties in Texas; Howard County in Maryland; and the bipartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors joined the amicus brief as well. | 1/9/2020 09:47:53 |

| Milling and Paving Resumes Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 4, 2020) Vehicle owners are reminded to heed alerts from the City and move their vehicles from streets set to be milled or resurfaced starting on Tuesday, September 8. <br>The list of impacted streets [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). New streets on the list are largely in City Council Districts 4, 7 and 8. <br>This year the City is investing nearly $15.7 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout the Pittsburgh.   <br>Roughly 27 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>As many residents are staying indoors and sheltering in place, the City is making an extra effort to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving [are posted on the DOMI website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/street-resurfacing) and will be publicized through city social media channels.   <br>Residents who have registered to receive telephone alerts from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will receive robocalls if their street is to be paved the following week (residents can sign up for alerts by 412-255-2423).

| Traffic Calming on Marshall Avenue in Perry South Begins Wednesday | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 8, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) advises that Marshall Avenue (State Route 0019) from Brighton Road to Perrysville Avenue will be striped with new painted lane markings in Pittsburgh’s Perry South neighborhood.<br>The purpose of the project is to discourage motorist speeding, enhance pedestrian safety, and provide accommodations for bicyclists. Speed data collected by the Department in the summer of 2019 showed the median speed of motorists on Marshall Avenue near Linwood Avenue is 33 mph. After completion of the project, DOMI will collect data to determine if the project’s objectives have been accomplished.<br>The project will include installation of high visibility piano key-style crosswalks and painted bump outs at intersections to improve pedestrian and motorist sight lines. From Brighton Avenue to Linwood Avenue, a parking lane with a buffered bicycle climbing lane will be striped on the south curb line to reduce travel lane widths.<br>Pavement marking work is tentatively expected to begin on Wednesday, September 9, and last approximately five days, weather permitting. Hours of construction will be Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Lane restrictions may occur but at a minimum, one lane of traffic will be maintained.<br>We understand this may be a short-term inconvenience and we hope to work together with you in a professional and amicable manner for the long-term improvement of your neighborhood. For more information about the project please see the project fact sheet located here at [https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/current-projects](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/current-projects).

| Contract Connections: Bids for PGH Program to Offer Assistance for Small Businesses to Do Business with the City | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 8, 2020) A resolution was presented to City Council today for “Contract Connections: Bids for PGH”, a partnership between the City of Pittsburgh Office of Management and Budget and the [University of Pittsburgh Institute for Entrepreneurial Excellence's Small Business Development Center](https://entrepreneur.pitt.edu/centers/the-small-business-development-center-sbdc/). The educational program is intended to help local, diverse small businesses learn how to participate in the City and other agencies’ procurement processes in a three-part remote webinar series aimed at diversifying vendors working with the City and promoting the local small business economy.  <br>Contract Connections: Bids for PGH is open to small businesses for training and support in how to gain access to City of Pittsburgh contract opportunities so that they can be better prepared to submit solicitations and proposals for services needed by the City. The trainings will begin September 22, 2020 and will be held every other week throughout October at two different times during the day to accommodate varying schedules of small business owners or managers. The classes will include: Identifying Availability of New Contracts, Responding to Solicitations, and Closing the Deal.  <br>The program is being funded in part by the [Living Cities Accelerator](https://www.livingcities.org/work/city-accelerator) grant received by the City of Pittsburgh to enhance accessibility of the procurement and contracting process so that more small businesses- especially minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBE) - can do business with the City. Other city deliverables of this grant include the [Buying Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3678) forecast of local government agency bids anticipated over the next year so smaller businesses can prepare their proposals or collaborate with other small businesses to submit proposals and the [Beacon procurement platform](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html) that allows businesses to sign up to receive e-mail notifications for solicitations within their scope of service. The [Equal Opportunity Review Commission’s 2019 annual report](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4089) indicates that initiatives aimed at better accommodating MWBE and small business familiarity with the city’s procurement process have contributed to more contracts being awarded to MWBEs.  <br>“I’d like to thank our Office of Management and Budget and our partners at the University of Pittsburgh Institute for Entrepreneurial Excellence’s Small Business Development Center for their continued commitment to making our procurement process more inclusive,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Offering the sorts of direct assistance identified by our MWBE community as part of the Living Cities Accelerator program assessment means that we can better equip them to be competitive in our procurement process to get city contracts. When our small businesses and MWBEs succeed, our whole economy grows stronger by increasing sales, creating jobs, keeping jobs local, and investing city funds back into our communities.”  <br>For more information and to register, interested small businesses can visit [entrepreneur.pitt.edu/events/bids-for-pgh](http://entrepreneur.pitt.edu/events/bids-for-pgh/) or call 412-648-1542. | 8/9/2020 12:35:55 |

| Pittsburgh Joins Nationwide Coalition Opposing the Trump Administration's Abuse of U.S. Postal Service | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 9, 2020) Mayor William Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh have joined an amicus curiae brief on behalf of a nationwide coalition of local and tribal governments opposing recent U.S. Postal Service (USPS) changes that have slowed critically important mail delivery.  <br>The brief, filed by 32 local and tribal governments, urges courts in Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania to block the USPS changes, which impede the ability of localities to administer the November election and provide other core governmental services in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.  <br>[A copy of the brief is here.](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11256_FILED-EDPA_Brief_--_FINAL.pdf)<br>Starting in July 2020, U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy implemented a number of changes at USPS that have slowed down mail delivery and will make it harder for vulnerable communities, such as the elderly and communities of color, to vote by mail and receive essential government services. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted these same communities, and due to the changes, now face even greater hurdles in exercising their right to vote and receiving often life-saving services such as mail-delivered prescriptions.  <br>“These troubling changes from the Trump Administration are not only a threat to democracy, but to the quality-of-life of some of our most vulnerable neighbors. They must be reversed,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>The amicus brief highlights how the USPS changes and resulting mail delays directly interfere with local and tribal government plans to administer the November election, including by delaying the delivery and receipt of ballots—posing a particular risk that ballots cast by members of the military overseas as well as elderly and disabled voters mailing their ballots will not be received in time to be counted. As a result, many local and tribal governments now must revamp election plans and find the funds—a mere two months before the election—to increase voting hours, secure additional polling locations, and/or add ballot drop boxes to ensure their constituents can safely and reliably exercise their right to vote.  <br>The brief also details the ways that many local governments rely on the mail to provide their residents essential social services, such as mailing prescriptions and providing rental assistance. Delays in receiving these services are particularly high stakes for vulnerable communities, given the health and economic crisis across the nation.  <br>“As the brief makes clear, the USPS provides the backbone to so many crucial government services delivered by local and tribal governments,” said Public Rights Project’s Legal Director Jonathan Miller. “This isn’t just about the upcoming election. The USPS’s changes undercut the ability of those on the front lines of government committed to serving their communities. They delay needed medications, delivery of test results, and crucial notices. These politically motivated and totally unnecessary changes harm people’s lives.”  <br>A diverse coalition of local and tribal jurisdictions joined the City of Columbus, the County of Santa Clara and Public Rights Project in filing the amicus brief. Signatories include: Philadelphia, PA; Cook County, IL; Alameda City, CA; Cincinnati, OH; Atlanta, GA; Dayton, OH; Austin, TX; East Palo Alto, CA; Berkeley, CA; Flint, MI; Boston, MA; Gary, IN; Cambridge, MA; Houston, TX; Chicago, IL; Harris County, TX; Los Angeles County, CA; Los Angeles City, CA; Portland, OR; Madison, WI; Saint Paul, MN; Marin County, CA; Santa Cruz, CA; Monterey County, CA; Seattle, WA; Oakland, CA; Somerville, MA; West Hollywood, CA; Yurok Tribe, CA.  <br>The brief, attached, was filed in support of motions for preliminary injunctions filed in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, et al. v. DeJoy et al., No. 2-20-cv-04096 (E.D. Pa.) and State of New York, et al. v. Trump, et al., No. 1-20-cv-02340 (D.D.C.). | 9/9/2020 10:47:02 |
| 35 Neighborhood Teams Recruiting Volunteers to Pick Up Litter for City's Fourth Annual Garbage Olympics | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 10, 2020) On September 26, 2020, 34 Pittsburgh neighborhood teams and Penn Hills plan to compete in the city’s fourth annual Garbage Olympics to pick up trash from city streets. With COVID-19 protocols in place, groups will be encouraged to socially distance, and thus cover more ground in their neighborhoods. <br>The City’s Department of Public Works and the [Mayor’s Clean Pittsburgh Commission](https://pittsburghpa.gov/clean-pgh/cpc) will provide not only bags and gloves this year, but also personal protective equipment (PPE) and "nifty nabber" litter grabbers.<br>The Garbage Olympics began in 2017 with five teams competing for an Oscar award for the most trash collected. The event has grown exponentially since starting, with more than one third of Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods city-wide participating in 2019. <br>Linda Donahue, who organizes clean-ups through the Carrick Community Council, says, "It might be a simple act, but picking up litter makes an immediate and noticeable difference in our community.  It connects us to one another - even WITH social distancing- and makes us feel part of something bigger."<br>"The Garbage Olympics is truly a team effort! Neighborhoods are kept clean and beautiful thanks to a lot of collaboration among neighborhood groups, non-profits, and the City's Department of Public Works. The Clean Pittsburgh Commission is thrilled to help with empowering this work and some fun along the way," said Alicia Carberry of the Clean Pittsburgh Commission.<br>The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Works will again collect the trash from designated locations in each neighborhood, and the City’s hard-to-recycle vendor, [ECS&R](https://ecsr.net/pittsburgh-recycling/), will drive around to pick up and recycle the televisions found during clean-ups. <br>"Volunteer efforts are a great way to help in keeping our city as litter-free as possible. It also exposes those who volunteer to what an ongoing problem litter is in our city.  We want everyone to be careful in this COVID-19 climate, and are proud to be able to provide supplies and services to the Garbage Olympics," says Public Works Superintendent Bill Crean.<br>Some Pittsburgh City Councilmembers are purchasing gift cards to local restaurants for the teams in their districts to take out lunches to go. Previous years have ended with an in-person closing ceremony-- this year’s winners will be announced in a YouTube video the same day.<br>Registered neighborhood teams, captain contact information and meeting spots can be found on https://sites.google.com/view/gopgh/neighborhoods<br>The deadline for new neighborhood teams to register is Monday, September 14th.<br>Registering guarantees bags, gloves, and PPE, as well as timely collection of the trash collected. <br>Interested participants can also email garbageolympicspgh@gmail.com or text or call (412) 447-1017 to join a team.

| City, Urban Redevelopment Authority Investing $72,000 in Community-Driven Project at Former Beltzhoover Elementary School | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 16, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh and Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) announced today that they are investing $72,000 in improvements to the historic former Beltzhoover Elementary School as part of the URA’s [Neighborhood Initiatives Fund](https://www.ura.org/pages/neighborhood-initiatives-fund) (NIF) program. The investment was presented to the Beltzhoover Consensus Group today, who intend to redevelop the former school using a community-driven revitalization strategy.  <br>The former Beltzhoover Elementary School is a historic 60,000 square-foot building purchased by the Beltzhoover Consensus Group in 2018 with the intention to create a community center to meet the needs of the neighborhood, including affordable housing and a shared community space. Phase I of the revitalization project includes roof repairs and stabilization, an environmental site assessment, existing condition plans, and community outreach and engagement. The community group is working with additional partners on the project, including Neighborhood Allies, Heinz Endowments, and the Birmingham Foundation. <br>“Today we’re seeing the purpose of the NIF in action,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Through this program the City of Pittsburgh and the URA are able to directly invest money into our communities for a project that is being run by our communities and for our communities. It puts their vision at the center of development. Community-driven development can and should be the strategy and our standard for all of our development so that it’s responding to what our residents want and need.”  <br>Funding for this project is part of the second round of the NIF, which totals $568,000 being awarded for 12 neighborhood improvement projects and programs across nine neighborhoods. This program is designed to help unlock the economic opportunity and placemaking potential within neighborhoods by allowing communities to access funding for neighborhood-scale projects, particularly those in Community Development Block Grant eligible communities.  <br>“It’s imperative that we continue to support nonprofit organizations during this time of uncertainty to ensure they can continue their important neighborhood work, and the URA thanks the City of Pittsburgh for providing this funding,” said URA Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker. “Through the NIF Program we are investing in these neighborhood-scale initiatives intended to improve residents’ quality of life and shine a spotlight on the amazing projects happening within our communities.” <br>The announcement was made today on site of the project where Mayor Peduto, Deputy Executive Director Walker, and Mayor’s Office Chief Economic Development Officer Marty LaMar were joined by City Councilman Bruce Kraus and Jennifer Cash Wade of the Beltzhoover Consensus Group.  <br>"We are witnessing the rebirth of the Beltzhoover School which has stood for generations as an important anchor for Betlzhoover and Hilltop residents alike,” said Councilman Kraus. “This begins the process of restoring this historic landmark to its well deserved glory." <br>"The NIF has proven to be an invaluable tool in providing support to community driven projects undertaken by community members who are committed to continually improving the quality of life for their residents,” said Ms. Cash Wade. “Receiving this award will allow the Beltzhoover Consensus Group to begin the work of restoring Beltzhoover Elementary School to it's rightful place as the center of our community in a manner that best serves the community and the entire Hilltop for today and years to come.  And for this we are grateful.” | 16/9/2020 10:41:40 |

| Pittsburgh Pension Fund Adopts Sustainable Investment Policy | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 17, 2020) After thorough study, the City of Pittsburgh Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund has adopted new “Socially Responsible Investing” guidelines to screen for pension investments in companies that follow environmentally friendly and socially responsible business procedures. <br>Last summer, Mayor William Peduto asked the CMPTF to divest the City’s pension funds from fossil fuel industries and in February the pension board named a subcommittee to study the matter. At its meeting this month the board unanimously adopted the new investment polices, which in the investment industry are called ESGs (Environmental, Social and Governance) guidelines. <br>In July Pittsburgh and 16 other cities cosponsored a policy adopted by the U.S. Conference of Mayors urging  cities across the globe to explore divesting from fossil fuels and invest in climate solutions to support a green recovery and a just transition. Divestiture is also supported by C40 and Climate Mayors, of which Mayor Peduto is [a member](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3501). The Mayor will be speaking on a Climate Week online panel on sustainable investing this Tuesday with the mayors of New York City, London and New Orleans. <br>“When we began our work to develop Pittsburgh's third climate action plan, we realized that responsible investing by our pension fund is one of the most critical tools not only in advancing a just and clean energy transition, but a move that is simply a good economic investment strategy too," Mayor Peduto said. <br>The pension board amended its investment policy statement September 3 to include language on its new Socially Responsible Investing Program Guidelines that goes beyond the divestment goals in the City’s Climate Action Plan. The amendment incorporates policies on Protection of the Environment, Reducing Arms Production and Promotion of Human Dignity, and adopts a screening tool to invest in socially responsible assets and companies that align with the CMPTF’s existing financial performance investment criteria.  <br>“The CMPTF believes that socially responsible investing should be factored into the makeup of the fund’s portfolio,” said CMPTF Board Chairman Ralph Sicuro. “Moving forward we will work to make sure City funds are not invested in entities that could have a negative effect on society and our environment while also maintaining a portfolio that generates strong returns. I would like to thank our ESG subcommittee for their work to create an investment policy that aligns with the values of board trustees and plan participants.” <br>The full wording of the Socially Responsible Investing Program Guidelines is as follows: <br>“In addition to CMPTF requesting all equity separate account managers screen out particular investment holdings which have been mentioned above, CMPTF has set aside a portion of the portfolio dedicated for a socially responsible investment allocation with a focus on aligning the underlying investment holdings with the values and beliefs of the trustees and participants of the plan. These dedicated investment mandates will incorporate socially responsible investment factors through a positive screening investment approach. Positive screening selects companies based on specific investment factors including environmentally friendly products and practices as well as socially responsible businesses procedures. By investing in companies who practice responsible initiatives in this transparent manner, investors are encouraging behaviors that align with their underlying values and beliefs. Positive screens will include: <br>Protection of the Environment:  <br>- Consider companies that engage in development and implementation of environmentally friendly products and services. <br>- Consider companies that preserve the planet’s ecological heritage and creating environmentally sensitive and innovative technologies <br>- Consider companies that undertake energy conservation initiatives and develop alternative renewable and clean energy resources <br>Reduce Arms Production <br>- Support shareholder actions to limit weapon productions, limit foreign sales of weapons and convert corporate capacity and energy to non-military uses and initiatives <br>Promotion of Human Dignity <br>- Use shareholder resolutions and other means to encourage companies to provide sufficient wages, working conditions and other social benefits that enable their employees and families to a balanced working life. <br>- Encourage efforts by companies to promote a respect for fundamental human rights throughout the countries in which they operate and sale products or services <br>- Favor companies that actively promote corporate policies on equal pay and promotion opportunities for women and minorities <br>- Encourage efforts by companies to promote the active participation of women and minorities in the representation and management of the company, particularly in creation of company policies and decision-making as well as inclusion in executive and corporate leadership <br>- Favor companies who strive to make a positive impact on housing, health care and other necessary services that improve the quality of life for the under-served population <br>- Favor companies that engage in practices or policies intended to end human trafficking <br>- Favor companies who exhibit the ability to hire and advance the careers of women and minorities <br>In addition to the above listed positive screens, managers may add additional positive initiatives as long as it is for the benefit of society and aligns with CMPTF’s risk adjusted return objectives. <br>Lastly, additional socially responsible investment policies may be added if ever there is a conflict with the Client’s values and current investment holdings.” | 18/9/2020 10:44:53 |
| Milling and Paving Resumes Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 18, 2020) Vehicle owners are reminded to heed alerts from the City and move their vehicles from streets set to be milled or resurfaced starting on Monday, September 21. <br>The list of impacted streets [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). New streets on the list are largely in City Council Districts 7 and 8. <br>This year the City is investing nearly $15.7 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout the Pittsburgh.   <br>Roughly 27 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>As many residents are staying indoors and sheltering in place, the City is making an extra effort to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving [are posted on the DOMI website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/street-resurfacing) and will be publicized through city social media channels.   <br>Residents who have registered to receive telephone alerts from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will receive robocalls if their street is to be paved the following week (residents can sign up for alerts by 412-255-2423). Paving crews will be placing fliers on vehicle windshields 48 hours in advance. | 18/9/2020 13:48:35 |

| City, Urban Redevelopment Authority Investing $100,000 in the Revitalization of Esser's Plaza | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 23, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh and Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) announced today that they are investing $100,000 in improvements for Esser’s Plaza on the South Side as part of the URA’s Neighborhood Initiatives Fund (NIF) program. The investment was presented to the South Side Community Council today, who are working to revitalize the plaza to be a welcoming, open space where the community can gather. <br>Located at 12th and East Carson Streets, Esser’s Plaza is a poorly lit park area between Armstrong Park and the old market house in the heart of Pittsburgh’s historic South Side. Formerly the Birmingham Plaza, it was renamed Cindy Esser Plaza in August 2006 to honor the long-time South Side advocate who passed away in October 2002. <br>The renovation project includes infrastructure and site improvements, new lighting, green areas, seating, paving, and programming. The community group is working with additional partners, including Laquatra Bonci Landscape Architects, who donated the conceptual design, Engineers Without Borders, who will draw up construction documents, and the Colcom Foundation. <br>“We are so grateful to see the revitalization of this South Side park and community space through partnerships and collaboration, including the NIF program,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Esser’s Plaza was named in honor of Cindy Esser, a community advocate, and we’re grateful to honor her memory by providing the investment the South Side Community Council needs to realize their community’s vision for their neighborhood.” <br>Funding for this project is part of the second round of the NIF, which totals $568,000 being awarded for 12 neighborhood improvement projects and programs across nine neighborhoods. This program is designed to help unlock the economic opportunity and placemaking potential within neighborhoods by allowing communities to access funding for neighborhood-scale projects, particularly those in Community Development Block Grant eligible communities. <br>“The Neighborhood Initiatives Fund program is a perfect example of how we are working together to drive neighborhood-scale development in Pittsburgh,” URA Executive Director Greg Flisram said. “We are unlocking the economic and placemaking potential within neighborhoods citywide, improving residents’ quality of life while shining a spotlight on these important community assets.” <br>The announcement was made today on site of the project where Mayor Peduto, URA Executive Director Flisram, Mayor’s Office Chief Economic Development Officer Marty LaMar, and City Councilman Bruce Kraus were joined by Barbara Rudiak, president of the South Side Community Council, and members of the South Side community. <br>"Esser Plaza has served as a quiet oasis in the heart of South Sides' Carson Street corridor, for residents and visitors alike, for decades,” said City Councilman Bruce Kraus. “Receipt and application of this NIF grant compliments the dedicated and much appreciated restoration and fundraising efforts of the Plaza Stakeholder Task Force residents, ensuring Esser Plaza remains a safe, clean and well maintained park space for generations to come." <br>"The Esser’s Plaza renovation project began about a decade ago when the South Side Local Development Company ‘bequeathed’ funds to the South Side Community Council to improve the parks in the Flats,” said Kitty Vagley of the South Side Community Council Plaza Stakeholder Task Force. “That ember was kept alive through the efforts of multiple persons, notably Jennifer Holliman, who engaged the commitment of Engineers Without Borders. The URA Neighborhood Initiatives Fund grant allows the project to be realized and the community is deeply grateful." | 23/9/2020 10:13:20 |

| City, Urban Redevelopment Authority Investing $250,000 in Three Hill District Community-Driven Projects | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 29, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh and Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) announced today that they are investing a total of $250,000 in three community-driven projects in the Hill District neighborhood as part of the Neighborhood Initiatives Fund (NIF) program.  <br>Checks were presented to three community organizations: <br>The Amani Christian Community Development Corporation was awarded $100,000 in funding for the redevelopment project on two parcels located at the intersection of Herron and Wylie Avenues. The project site has an existing three-story building and vacant lot that will be redeveloped as a newly renovated and constructed space. The project will include a 1,600 square foot architecture and design accelerator, studio, and gallery.  <br>The Hill Community Development Corporation was awarded $50,000 for their Wylie Avenue Restaurant project. While the initial stages of this project have been completed, the NIF project will be completed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to renovate two adjacent lots to add outdoor seating and a chef’s garden. This funding will provide the final renovation and equipment necessary to launch a functioning restaurant in a transformed neighborhood that is ripe for investment and growth.  <br>The Hill District Federal Credit Union was awarded $100,000 to double the size of their facility to 2,500 square feet. This project will allow for the expansion of financial education services and counseling to accommodate the rapidly increasing volume of low-income individuals and families requiring their unique financial services assistance.  <br>“The NIF program awards to these three organizations are a great example of how community-driven development responds to the needs of the people in our neighborhoods with the services and amenities they want to see,” Mayor William Peduto said of today's announcement. “We are grateful for the work that Amani Christian Community Development Council, Hill Community Development Corporation, and Hill District Federal Credit Union are doing in providing these important projects for their neighbors and their community’s vision.”  <br>"The NIF program is a perfect example of how the City, URA, and community are working together to create an equitable Pittsburgh," said URA Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker. "The program is designed to support nonprofit and community organizations by increasing project visibility and access to funding so that community-based projects can truly be realized. By investing in these types of neighborhood scale initiatives, we are improving residents' quality of life and helping to revitalize and stabilize these neighborhoods. We are excited about these three projects and how they will complement the URA's and community's plan to breathe new life into the Centre Avenue corridor." <br>Funding for these three projects is part of the second round of the NIF, which totals $568,000 being awarded for 12 neighborhood improvement projects and programs across nine neighborhoods. This program is designed to help unlock the economic opportunity and placemaking potential within neighborhoods by allowing communities to access funding for neighborhood-scale projects, particularly those in Community Development Block Grant eligible communities. <br>The announcement was made today at the Centre Heldman Plaza in the Hill District where Deputy Executive Director Walker, Mayor’s Office Chief Economic Development Officer Marty LaMar, and City Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle presented checks to Reverend Lee Walls and Lakeisha Byrd of Amani Christian Community Development Corporation, David Serbin of the Hill Community Development Corporation, and Richard Witherspoon of the Hill District Federal Credit Union. <br>"Amani is committed to preserving and revitalizing existing structures within the Hill District and working with Hill businesses like Communion LLC to revitalize the landscape in our community. We are grateful to have a resource like NIF to accomplish this goal," said Reverend Lee Walls, executive director of Amani Christian Community Development Corporation. <br>“The Hill CDC is pleased to have the support of the URA and City in bringing much needed resources to the community relative to food venues" Marimba Milliones, president and CEO of the Hill Community Development Corporation, said of the award. "We believe that having additional options to access food in our neighborhood is vital for economic and health benefits.”<br>“The Hill District Federal Credit Union is in its 50th year of attending to the financial health of the residents in the Hill District community,” said Richard Witherspoon, CEO of Hill District Federal Credit Union. “Today, with the consciousness in society toward social and economic justice in African American communities across the country, there is a higher desire to support and help to prosper institutions such as ours. With that in mind, we are now experiencing significant growth. Since July of 2020, we have opened over 200 new accounts. We have created new savings and loan programs to help people get through these difficult times. If this trend continues, we will have to increase capacity and income to accommodate our growth. We have been working on plans to expand and strengthen HDFCU. With the grant from the URA’s NIF program, we will be that much closer towards the goal of capacity building.” | 29/9/2020 10:13:18 |

| City of Pittsburgh Welcomes Halloween Trick-or-Treating with Precautions | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 5, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh welcomes upcoming trick-or-treating this Halloween but urges residents to follow safety protocols during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. <br>The official trick-or-treating hours will be 5-7 p.m. on Saturday, October 31, but following [guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html#halloween) many behaviors will have to change this year. <br>Residents are urged to: <br>- Trick-or-treat only with family members <br>- Wear cloth facemasks as well as Halloween masks <br>- Carry hand sanitizer <br>- Distribute candy by leaving it outside, and not have in-person and face-to-face interactions at the door <br>- Follow social distancing on sidewalks, and when approaching homes where others are getting candy <br>- Not attend indoor costume parties <br>Like any other year, motorists are asked to be especially vigilant on Halloween night, decrease speeds and increase awareness of trick-or-treating children and families. | 5/10/2020 09:51:23 |
| Mayor Peduto Submits CROWN Act to City Council to Protect from Hairstyle Discrimination | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 5, 2020) The Office of Mayor William Peduto has submitted the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (CROWN) Act to City Council today to offer additional protection from hairstyle discrimination for Black Pittsburghers in employment, housing, education, and public accommodations. <br>Black individuals’ natural hair grows in different textures, lengths, and colors, and can be worn in a variety of hairstyles, which hold cultural and personal significance in the Black community. However, modern ideas of professionalism tend to reflect European or white standards. The recent CROWN study conducted by the JOY Collective indicates that 80% of Black women in the study said that they felt the need to alter their natural hair to “fit in” in professional setting. The CROWN study also indicates that Black women are 1.5 times more likely to be sent home from the workplace because of their hair, their hair is 3.4 times more likely to be considered “unprofessional,” and they are 83% more likely to report being judged more harshly on their looks than white women nationally.  <br>The Gender Equity Commission’s 2019 “ [Pittsburgh’s Inequality Across Gender and Race Report](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10645__Pittsburgh's_Inequality_Across_Gender_and_Race_JULY_2020.pdf)” suggests that these national trends are reflected here in Pittsburgh as the report outlined that personal, professional, housing, and educational outcomes are the most inequitable for Black women in the city. Locally, some workplaces, schools, and other groups have created grooming policies that create the opportunity to exclude Black women, Black men, and religious minorities in that space. This legislation seeks to remove these barriers and protect residents and employees from this type of discrimination.  <br>“The City of Pittsburgh is committed to equity and to eliminating the barriers that unfairly affect our communities,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Black hair is and always has been professional, but that has not always been reflected by employers, schools, or agencies in this city. This legislation affirms our commitment to improving outcomes for Black residents and make certain that they do not face natural hair discrimination in the workplace, when searching for a home, or when entering a business.” <br>The legislation would provide legal recourse for individuals experiencing hairstyle discrimination. Claims or reports of hairstyle discrimination can be reported to the City of Pittsburgh’s Commission on Human Relations (CHR), who have already received numerous complaints. The CHR will be releasing guidance for landlords, employers, and business owners to understand the ordinance, understand hairstyle discrimination, learn best practices for creating a welcoming environment, and promoting actions to proactively prevent this type of discrimination over the coming weeks.  <br>“Pittsburgh’s CROWN legislation is an important step in creating explicit protections that can help us realize a more inclusive and racially-just city,” said CHR’s Executive Director Megan Stanley. “While claims of natural hair discrimination may have been filed previously under the classes of race or religion, we want to make clear that natural hairstyles and coverings are welcoming, do not affect a persons skills or abilities, and that no person should be treated differently based on how they choose to wear or treat their hair. Sadly, we know this to be an issue both locally and across the country, and we hope that the legislation introduced and the companion guidance documents will help to create a more equitable Pittsburgh.” <br>Similar legislation has been passed and implemented in California, Colorado, New Jersey and has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, PA State House of Representatives, and is being pursued by the Philadelphia City Council. The CROWN Act in Pittsburgh has been supported by the local community.  <br>“Black women and girls have historical been negatively judged and excluded both personally and professionally based on the texture and/or style of their hair,” said Kathi Elliott, Executive Director of Gwen’s Girls. “Society has taught us that it’s not professional or not beautiful. To be sent home from school or denied a job because ‘it’s a distraction’ or not professional, is an remnant of systemic racism. As the Crown Act continues to make progress on the state and federal levels, it’s encouraging to see the City of Pittsburgh taking this step, sending the message that this discrimination will not be tolerated and that violations will be met with legal recourse. Now we need school systems and businesses to review and change their policies and practices that perpetuate this discrimination.” <br>The legislation will be introduced during the regular City Council meeting on Tuesday, October 6. The full ordinance is available [here](https://pittsburgh.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4657946&GUID=6A9AB631-2E7D-46EE-89A6-FC104157984D&Options=ID|Text|&Search=2020-0769). | 5/10/2020 12:55:00 |
| City Receives Funding for Diesel Exhaust Systems at Medic Stations | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 6, 2020) City of Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services stations will be outfitted with diesel exhaust systems to protect medics from harmful vehicle fumes. <br>The overall $1 million in upgrades will be assisted by a $592,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and $446,000 from the City’s capital budget. The funding is being introduced to Pittsburgh City Council today. <br>Diesel exhaust systems expel diesel fumes from the vehicles to the outside, while the vehicles are running inside the station, making for a safer breathing environment for EMS staff.  They are specially designed for Public Safety equipment, so will automatically disengage from the vehicles when they go out for a call. <br>“This project will help protect the Public Safety's most important asset — its personnel. Ensuring a safe work environment will help provide employees the comfort of knowing that they are not breathing unhealthy exhaust fumes,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. <br>Fire Bureau stations already have the equipment, so the project will bring EMS in line with Fire. The upgrades are being managed by the Department of Public Works. <br>The diesel exhaust systems are planned for Rescue 01: 4 systems; Medic 14: 3 systems; Medic 10: 3 systems; Medic 08: 1 system; Medic 06: 4 systems; Medic 04: 4 systems; Medic 03: 2 systems;  Medic 02: 4 systems; Medic 01 and 11 (located in the same station): 2 systems; Headquarters: 7 systems; EMS Training: 6 systems. | 6/10/2020 09:28:36 |

| 10th Street Reopens After Months of Repairs Due to Sinkhole | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 8, 2020) After a year of complicated work by several agencies and utilities to address a sinkhole and other damages, 10th Street in Downtown Pittsburgh is finally reopening today. <br>Pittsburgh Public Safety officials responded to the sinkhole on October 28, 2019, which was so large (60 by 35 by 18 feet deep) that it swallowed the rear of a Port Authority bus. The driver of the bus and its riders were safe, but Public Safety’s next concern was the stability and safety of steam lines, water and sewage lines, and communications infrastructure perched below the street’s unsupported, cantilevered slabs of concrete. With the assistance of Allegheny Crane Rental and DiPasquale Engineering, officials ultimately brought a crane to the scene to carefully remove the bus while not further disrupting the infrastructure below. <br>Plans were to reopen the street within weeks. However utility companies found there was indeed damage to infrastructure beneath 10th Street and they began months of work to fix the damages, work that was further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic starting in March of this year. <br>The City’s response was overseen by Chief Operations Officer Kinsey Casey and included work by Public Safety, Public Works, and Mobility and Infrastructure. Responding utilities and companies included Duquesne Light, Peoples Gas, Comcast, Verizon, Port Authority, Pittsburgh-Allegheny County Thermal (PACT), and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority. Officials from the adjacent Westin Pittsburgh hotel were also helpful throughout the work. <br>Restoration costs were shared 50/50 between the City and PWSA. <br>“This has been an incredibly challenging year for our city, nation and planet, and the 10th street sinkhole represented everything 2020 has been about — danger, disruption and frustration, but ultimately solutions, due to a lot of hard work by people working together. I can’t thank our partners, and especially our Downtown residents and businesses, enough for their patience and understanding,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>Duquesne Light made improvements to the street grid without any outages to customers, and replaced terra cotta conduit run between 3 manholes with new PVC ducts encased in reinforced concrete. <br>Peoples Gas conducted a complete safety check and performed corrosion protection work on their existing steel pipeline. <br>Comcast technicians replaced conduit at the site and protect their fiber, which was secured during street restoration. Verizon secured and repaired their lines as well. <br>Some of the most complicated work was performed by PACT and PWSA. <br>PACT pumped and removed water and soil materials from steam tunnels and cleaned and sanitized them; removed stray concrete damage; repaired several piping supports and concrete anchors damaged during the incident; reinsulated sections of the main steam line that sustained water damage or needed to be removed to make concrete and support repairs; and made sure the steam line below to was ready for this fall and winter. <br>PWSA cleared approximately 2,500 tons of debris from the 48-inch sewer running down 10th street to the Allegheny River outfall point, utilizing a vactor machine sitting on a river barge and a diver to remove debris from the river bed. <br>A PWSA contractor then took the lead on removing all debris from the sinkhole, giving space for other utilities to repair damaged infrastructure. As part of the rebuilding process, PWSA also installed a new bulkhead to the sewer manhole that was damaged when the street collapsed. After all repairs were complete, they filled the hole with stone, replaced bricks, and poured new concrete to reopen the street to car and pedestrian traffic.  <br>At the end of the project, crews completed the following: <br>- Added approximately 746 tons of stone backfill to the sinkhole <br>- Replaced 2,097 square feet of bricks <br>- Poured approximately 395 tons of concrete <br>- Logged over 1,100 hours of work to complete the project | 8/10/2020 10:06:20 |

| Mayor Recommends Removal of Schenley Park Columbus Statue | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 9, 2020) After much deliberation, Mayor William Peduto today announced his agreement with the City Art Commission finding that the Christopher Columbus statue in Schenley Park be removed, and directed that the statue be displayed in a private location still to be determined.<br>The Commission unanimously voted September 23 to remove the statue. After reading Commission testimony and talking to passionate advocates on both sides of the issue, the Mayor made the difficult decision that removing the statue is justified, and that it can be better displayed in a private location that places Columbus, his memory and his history in different context.<br>The Mayor [issued a letter](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11662_Letter_to_Art_Commission_on_Christopher_Columbus.pdf) to the Art Commission today that reviews the celebration of Columbus by Italian-Americans who were subject to discrimination after emigrating to the United States, and the subsequent reckoning with the explorer’s support of slavery and genocide. The letter says in part:<br>“All four of my grandparents were Italian and personally experienced discrimination, yet learned to love their new country. I am tremendously proud to be part of the Italian-American community in Pittsburgh, just as I am proud to be Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh and to represent all people of our city.<br>After much thought and prayer I believe it is now time for us to return the Columbus statue to the Italian-American community that brought it into existence. They can preserve it in a manner than celebrates Italian-American culture, while acknowledging the wreckage that slavery and racism has done to America.”<br>The letter asks the Art Commission to make a final vote on the disposition of the statue.<br>No decisions have yet been made on when the statue will be removed, or the private location where it will be stored and displayed. City crews may cover the statue until it can be removed.<br>A copy of the Mayor’s letter [is available here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11662_Letter_to_Art_Commission_on_Christopher_Columbus.pdf). | 9/10/2020 14:53:45 |

| City Dispatching New DPW Crews to Neighborhood Business Districts | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 13, 2020) Using smart garbage cans with sensors, the Department of Public Works is both expanding garbage pick-up service in neighborhood business districts while saving money by more efficiently deploying department resources. <br>Pittsburgh is the first city in the country to deploy the cans citywide, for a total of 1,300 cans across city neighborhoods. (Other cities typically focus them in only certain business districts). First deployed in 2017 the cans send information to DPW indicating when they are full, allowing the department to dispatch pick-up crews only to those receptacles in need of service. <br>The moves follow other technological upgrades from DPW and the Department of Innovation and Performance related to the city’s Snow Plow tracker [that are saving the City $1 million annually in road salt costs.](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4114)<br>“Cutting-edge work by officials at Public Works are providing better services and saving taxpayer money at the same time. These are simple and smart changes that are a model to other cities nationwide,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>Previous to the adoption of the smart cans DPW could have up to 24 people in a given day (across all three shifts) emptying street garbage cans. The department is now deploying six dedicated workers, which will free up the other 18 people to be reassigned to other tasks such as pothole patching, weed removal and so on. <br>The new Sensored Litter Receptacle Crews will work for the first time on weekends, and on Mondays will target cleanup of high-impact sites such as the North Shore, East Carson Street and Lawrenceville. <br>"I’m excited to implement the first ever crew dedicated to using technology that will make us more efficient and ensure our city is cleaner seven days a week," DPW foreman Mike Boyd said. <br>Following real-time data sent by the smart cans to DPW, one crew will cover the 2nd and 3rd Divisions covering half the sensored cans in the city, while another crew will run the remaining routes of 1st, 4th and 5th Divisions covering the other half. A third crew will overlap on Mondays to clear cans that typically get high use over the weekends. <br>Data collected during the roll-out of the cans shows that on any given day only 13% of the city’s cans reached the 90% full threshold for emptying. Before the smart cans were deployed roughly 1,130 cans were emptied each day whether they were full or not — now the sensors show only about 90 cans are in need of service daily.  <br>By more efficiently deploying pick-up staff DPW is expected to cut personnel costs for receptacle cleanup by at least half, while also expanding service.  <br>The change is also good for the climate, as the elimination of un-needed pickup routes decreases the usage of vehicles and fuel. | 13/10/2020 09:50:18 |
| Portion of Wenzell Avenue to Close Until December | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 13, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh will be closing Wenzell Avenue from Denlin Street to Banksville Road as part of the second phase of the Wenzell Avenue Reconstruction and Carnahan Bridge Replacement Project. Wenzell Avenue will close Saturday, October 17, 2020, and is projected to end December 15, 2020.<br>The project consists of the widening of Wenzell Avenue, drainage improvements, new traffic signals and sidewalks.

| City and URA Launch Avenues of Hope Initiative to Advance Revitalization of Historically Diverse Business Districts | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 14, 2020) Mayor William Peduto and the Urban Redevelopment Authority today formally launched the “Avenues of Hope” initiative to reprioritize business district investments in diverse city neighborhoods. <br>Avenues of Hope is a place-based, people-first approach that intervenes across all layers of successful, healthy, and sustainable Main Street development in largely Black and diverse neighborhoods across Pittsburgh, focusing on seven major business corridors. This initiative seeks to invest in existing small businesses and residents, supporting the inclusive growth of these neighborhoods. <br>The initiative will boost neighborhoods and help support middle-class jobs, families and entrepreneurship. The URA focus will be on housing investment, workforce connectivity, commercial corridor activation, façade renovations, and other impactful MWBE and small business supports.  <br>The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure will assist with paving, sidewalk improvements, traffic calming and pedestrian enhancement, and Public Works will assist in land maintenance, with the assistance of City Planning. <br>Avenues of Hope will also have an affordable housing component and work in conjunction with the City/URA Affordable Housing Trust Fund. <br>“Retail follows rooftops. By supporting both business districts and high-quality affordable housing, Avenues of Hope will bring a holistic approach to community revitalization,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>The avenues currently targeted for the program are Homewood, Larimer, Centre, Perrysville, Chartiers, Warrington and Irvine Street in Hazelwood. <br>“The URA was asked by the City to prioritize development with a focus on building black wealth and community health. What would it mean to intentionally drive investment into Black neighborhoods in a way that centers the preservation and celebration of Black life in Pittsburgh? Avenues of Hope takes the first step towards this kind of holistic community revitalization, revealing economic justice is about action, not rhetoric,” said Diamonte Walker, Deputy Executive Director of the URA. | 14/10/2020 12:28:45 |
| Taking Action in a Time of Crisis: the City of Pittsburgh Leads the Way Leveraging Procurement Power | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 15, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh is the latest member of ICLEI’s [Global Lead City Network on Sustainable Procurement](https://glcn-on-sp.org/home/) (GLCN). By joining the network the city has expressed the commitment to take an exemplary role globally in the implementation of sustainable public procurement, to act as a global and regional champion of sustainable procurement, and to collaborate with other cities in the network to exchange experiences and knowledge.<br>Pittsburgh drives sustainable procurement as a means to be a role model for climate action, local workforce development, fair and green consumption as well as circular use of resources. Through its commitment to equity and climate action, the [City of Pittsburgh](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html) recognizes the responsibility for sustainable procurement to ensure that their investments are providing key public services while contributing to a better tomorrow for all. <br>"Pittsburgh is proud to join the cities in the GLCN as we recognize that climate justice and sustainability must be addressed locally and globally. Procurement is an investment of public money and so it's critical that it be spent in an equitable and responsible way that promotes clean energy and sustainable solutions so that our money, our investments, and our jobs are creating a better Pittsburgh and world for all," said Mayor William Peduto.<br>Global exchange is valuable whilst operating in a different local context. Pittsburgh already got a first taste of sharing experiences and deep technical procurement insights in a recent exchange with the City of Rotterdam, GLCN member. The exchange focussed on the topic of renewable energy procurement and social return of investment, facilitated with support by the [Urban Transition Alliance](https://urbantransitions.org/), a city network and knowledge-exchange hub that supports industrial legacy cities from across the globe to identify common challenges, share knowledge, and develop solutions tailored to their individual sustainable transitions. Through the Alliance, Pittsburgh is embarking on efforts towards reducing 75 per cent of carbon emissions in the city administration by 2030 while seeking to generate up to 110,000 new full-time positions in the renewable energy sector. The key element of this transition is a new platform for electricity procurement to enable Pittsburgh’s buying cooperative, a group of 30 municipal agencies, to shift to renewable energy through power purchase contracts. <br>[ICLEI USA](http://www.icleiusa.org/) will support Pittsburgh in the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions impacts associated with the city’s procurement and supply-chains. Working throughout Pennsylvania and the nation, ICLEI USA will share Pittsburgh’s accomplishments as an encouragement for other cities to follow Pittsburgh’s lead.<br>Becoming a member of the GLCN, Pittsburgh joins a select group of leading cities across the world that set ambitious, quantifiable targets and showcase achievements tackling the climate crisis leveraging procurement as a tool. <br>The GLCN is a group of 16 cities committed to drive a transition to sustainable consumption and production by implementing sustainable and innovation procurement.

| Paving Resumes Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 16, 2020) Vehicle owners are reminded to heed alerts from the City and move their vehicles from streets set to be resurfaced starting on Monday, October 19. <br>The list of impacted streets [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). New streets on the list are largely in City Council Districts 1, 2, 4 and 7. <br>This year the City is investing nearly $15.7 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout the Pittsburgh.   <br>Roughly 27 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>As many residents are staying indoors and sheltering in place, the City is making an extra effort to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving [are posted on the DOMI website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/street-resurfacing) and will be publicized through city social media channels.   <br>Residents who have registered to receive telephone alerts from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will receive robocalls if their street is to be paved the following week (residents can sign up for alerts by 412-255-2423).

| City of Pittsburgh Releases 2020 Feed Pittsburgh Report | **PITTSBURGH, PA, (October 19, 2020)**– The City of Pittsburgh, through the Department of City Planning, released the 2020 Feed Pittsburgh report, a review of the state of food insecurity in the City of Pittsburgh, on World Food Day. <br>FeedPGH describes the four dimensions of food insecurity based on the United Nation’s 2018 report, identifies 23 Healthy Food Priority Areas in Pittsburgh through extensive mapping, outlines the City's goals to achieve Zero Hunger, and pinpoints key next steps.<br>"Food insecurity is a pressing issue for our City. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, one out of every five residents lived in food insecurity. Any amount is unacceptable for our community and the need is only greater now,” said Mayor William Peduto. "It is critical that we acknowledge the movement for racial equity that has swept the country over this summer and which has highlighted many of the challenges faced by our Black neighbors.” <br>Looking at food insecurity mapping, it’s clear that equity plays a crucial role in food security. Although only about 12% of Pittsburgh residents reside in one of the Healthy Food Priority Areas, one in three Black residents live in places that lack in food availability, face barriers in food access, and have high rates of diet-related chronic health diseases. <br>FeedPGH explores ways to address each of the dimension of food insecurity: <br>- Develop food pathways that increase healthy food availability and reduce barriers to food access for the most vulnerable Pittsburghers.<br>- Develop people, especially youth, to establish a future without food insecurity while ensuring workforce development opportunities and workplace protections now.<br>- Develop place, deepening opportunities for local food production while investing in Healthy Food Priority Areas.<br>- Shift culture around how to produce, acquire, consume, and dispose of food to establish a sustainable food system.<br>“The information (in FeedPGH) provides a foundational tool for the relationship of food and food insecurity to land use and community in comprehensive and neighborhood planning,” said Andrew Dash, Director of City Planning. “It will serve as a decision support tool for everything from guiding development decisions to determining productive reuse of vacant lots as we work to create a City that focuses on solutions for its most vulnerable residents.”<br>The City is working with community partners including the Pittsburgh Food Policy Council to address these challenges, recently receiving a Healthy City-County Challenge grant from the Aetna Foundation to engage residents.<br>"Food is essential to our survival. The level of stress created when you can't meet your basic needs is immense, and feeds into all other areas of one's life, increasing the chance of illness and disease,” says Shelly Danko+Day, Food Policy Planner. “There is not one solution to food insecurity. There need to be multiple actions happening simultaneously to alleviate hunger, while at the same time mitigating the causes of food insecurity.”<br>The full 2020 FeedPGH report and other materials [can be found here.](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/food-access-programs)<br>**FOR MORE INFORMATION:**<br>Shelly Danko+Day<br>Food Policy Planner<br>[Shelly.DankoDay@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Shelly.DankoDay@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>Andrew Dash<br>Director of City Planning<br>[Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov) | 19/10/2020 14:13:29 |
| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Report by Community Taskforce for Police Reform | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 19, 2020) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement regarding [the final report by the Community Taskforce for Police Reform](https://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/ctfpr), which he named in June: <br>“This amazing work by the Taskforce is more than I ever could have hoped for, and I am humbled and thankful by their exhaustive work on the critical need to reimagine police work in Pittsburgh. As the report notes the work by a diverse group of civic leaders — from corporate, religious and philanthropic entities; unions; health care and community-based service organizations; grassroots activism; and the law — brings the breadth of knowledge and experience that was necessary to take this very complicated and important subject to task. <br>Their independently produced recommendations are noted in the report under the focus areas of Eliminating Racial Disparities; Officer Wellness; Reimagining Policing; Recruitment, Training, Education and Hiring; Relations with Pittsburgh’s Fraternal Order of Police; Transparency and Accountability; Use of Force Changes Needed to Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Policy; and Use of Tear Gas, Rubber Bullets, “Flash-Bang” Devices and Other Less Lethal Methods of Crowd Control. <br>These recommendations will be our guiding influence as we make changes to police policy and budgeting to restructure police operations to make them more community-driven, safe and supportive for all residents, especially our Black neighbors. With these recommendations we will make real changes to policing, backed up by data and research, to ensure equity, accountability and transparency for all. <br>I must also thank Pittsburgh City Council for its initial changes to police methods already put into City law this year. <br>This report is only the latest step toward reform, following work we have already done and assistance we need from state and federal legislators. In June I created the Office of Community Health and Safety to redirect city resources to better meet community needs by housing social services, public health and social work experts who can assist first responders. I also [called on](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4016) Harrisburg to promote several police accountability and transparency reforms, and to make it easier for municipalities [to immediately release](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4073) body-worn camera footage. <br>I have joined efforts led by the U.S. Conference of Mayors to engage with other city leaders nationwide as we together seek the best practices for reimagine how policing is performed across America, in many ways through the types of changes recommended in the Community Taskforce report. <br>In sum, the Taskforce report is a model not only for Pittsburgh but the nation, and is a springboard for actions we must continue to take to protect Black lives.” | 19/10/2020 12:57:52 |
| City Opens New Monitor to Forward Trail | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 19, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure has opened the Monitor to Forward trail, creating a connection for non-vehicular traffic between the residential neighborhoods in that area south of the Squirrel Hill tunnel to Forward Avenue and the Murray Avenue business district.  <br>The trail, which cost an estimated $50,000, is constructed of compacted aggregate, with asphalt paving through an existing gravel parking lot. It is between the terminus of Monitor Street at Beechwood Boulevard and the parking lot of Solevo Wellness on Forward Avenue. <br>Work by DOMI, Folino Construction and Solevo included clearing of overgrowth along the trail alignment; minor grading to improve trail slope; and construction of a gravel trail between the asphalt path and the tie-in at the Solevo parking lot. <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11752_IMG_0093.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11751_IMG_4751.jpg)<br>( _Before/after photos: DOMI)_ | 19/10/2020 14:31:56 |

| City Announces NetPGH, Seeks Proposals for a Unified Fiber Connectivity Network for City Facilities | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 21, 2020) The Department of Innovation & Performance (I&P) announced today that they will be seeking requests for proposals (RFPs) in November 2020 for NetPGH, a comprehensive, unified fiber internet connectivity network for city facilities.  <br>In July 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued an order requiring cities to pay for institutional networks provided by cable franchise operators. The City of Pittsburgh has provided internet and network connectivity to its facilities using a variety of technologies and providers, with approximately half of its facilities using institutional networks. Anticipating rising costs from institutional networks combined with Mayor William Peduto’s goal for a resilient tool to connect city government and its residents, I&P is conducting a competitive bidding process for NetPGH to provide a streamlined network and unified experience for city facilities to improve standards of service, delivery, and availability.  <br>The RFP will seek a partner or a private-public partnership to build or lease a high availability fiber network that will sustain service for the city into the future. NetPGH will provide fiber connectivity to all city buildings including fire stations, EMS stations, recreation and healthy active living centers, and public safety infrastructure. Facility upgrades will include wiring to enable NetPGH and will promote efficiency in the delivery of public services.  <br>NetPGH will also help facilitate future plans for critical network use such as creating Smart Corridors by connecting the city’s traffic management system to use high-bandwith technology to prioritize transit vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. NetPGH will also support Mayor Peduto’s digital equity initiatives, like Rec2Tech that provides coding and technology-based education to youth, by providing high-quality internet connectivity at recreation centers and should enable future deployments of public WiFi in the city.  <br>The budgeted amount for the project is $1.5 million per year, which constitutes about 10% of the annual technology budget. The City hopes to find partners that can offer subsidies or additional outside funding to the project. The total investment of a built network is estimated to be above $10 million. <br>The RFP will be available on the City’s procurement portal, [Beacon](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html). | 21/10/2020 11:02:33 |

| Wightman Park Public Art Unveiled in Squirrel Hill | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 22, 2020) The Public Art & Civic Design Division (PACD) of the Department of City Planning is pleased to announce the unveiling of a large public art project in the newly renovated Wightman Park in Squirrel Hill. <br>The free-standing sculptures were designed and fabricated by artists Oreen Cohen and Alison Zapata of OOA Designs. OOA DESIGNS is a woman owned and operated artist collaboration between founders Oreen Cohen and Alison Zapata, established in 2018. They create aesthetic and functional public art that embraces color, forms and nature within their collaborative work. OOA developed, produced, and fabricated the Wightman Park sculptures between 2018-2020. <br>This City of Pittsburgh project was administered by PACD in collaboration with the Department of Public Works (DPW) and Council District 8. Funding came from DPW’s Capital Budget to meet the City’s Percent For Art requirement. The artists were selected through an RFP process, and have been working with DPW and Pashek + MTR to install the artwork.<br>Cohen and Zapata incorporated Wightman Park’s water and pollinator conservancy initiatives while also considering the history of the site as a glass manufacturing plant. The four large-scale sculptures of this installation are inspired by a waterfall, a bee hive, and pollinator insects. The works, titled _Cascade_ (the bench), _Transform, Pollinate,_ and _Illuminate_ (the bugs), use a zero-waste model that incorporates laser cut stainless steel to reflect the park’s nature and new storm water run-off design. <br>During meetings held by Council and the City, the community expressed wanting to see Wightman Park represented as a historical site of the Lorenz and Wightman Glass manufacturers. To commemorate this, eleven plates of dichroic borosilicate glass are inserted into the negative boulder shapes of the large waterfall sculpture. These glass pieces were purchased from the last standing glass production facility in Pittsburgh, Jeanette Glass. These fine details to the final aesthetic of the sculptures adds dimension not only to the artwork but activates the park as a reflective and welcoming site that incorporates the visions of community, history, and its future. OOA partnered with the Pittsburgh Glass Center, glass artist Ashley McFarland, and Protohaven Makerspace in the production of this work. <br>OOA Designs’ intentions in designing these sculptures was to fabricate considerate aesthetic designs that build connections with the immediate environment, communities, and functions of place. The no-waste process incorporates often discarded pieces into their concepts. Made in collaboration with a local Pittsburgh industrial facility, the production of the laser-cut stainless steel created negative and positive organic shapes. The “drops” or “fall outs” that normally are scraped were used to create three of the sculptures. <br>In December of 2019, OOA ran a workshop using the drop cuts from a small scale wooden model to work with the young students at the Carriage House Children's Center across the street from the park. The children puzzled together the pieces into what inspired the creation of the pollinator bugs. In the fabrication process, OOA used the steel drop pieces to create the three pollinator bugs (a butterfly, a bee, and a lighting bug) to be placed in the meadow areas of the park. Now, the children playing in the park will be able to remember that their vision had a part in creating these monumental works of art.<br>**FOR MORE INFORMATION:**<br>Oreen Cohen<br>Lead Project Artist, OOA Designs<br>585-732-8885<br>[ooadesigns@gmail.com](mailto:ooadesigns@gmail.com)<br>Anthony Cavalline<br>Arts, Culture, and History Specialist, PACD<br>[Anthony.Cavalline@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Anthony.Cavalline@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>Andrew Dash<br>Director of City Planning<br>[Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Andrew.Dash@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>[![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11842_OOA_DESIGNS.jpg)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11842_OOA_DESIGNS.jpg)<br>(Graphic: [OOA Designs](https://www.facebook.com/OOADESIGNSLLC/)) | 22/10/2020 12:07:52 |
| City Launches Clean and Lien Team to Address Blighted Properties | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 23, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works has launched a  “Clean and Lien” team to address blighted properties citywide. <br>Clean and Liens occur once a property owner has been notified of an overgrowth or debris violation and does not bring the property into compliance. The City then has the right to enter onto the property and take the necessary steps to remove the weeds or debris and place a tax lien on the property. <br>Cleaning up neighborhood blight is a priority of Mayor William Peduto and Council President Theresa Kail-Smith, who proposed launching the team during last year’s budget process. <br>“Our crews at DPW are some of the hardest working employees in the city, and this new team will be doing all it can to preserve quality-of-life in all city neighborhoods,” Councilwoman Kail- Smith said.<br>The Clean and Lien process involves multiple city departments including DPW; Permits, Licenses and Inspections; Finance; and Law.  <br>Previously DPW had crews in each division work on clean and  liens as part of their daily tasks along with patching potholes, picking up litter, trimming weeds on City property, and so on. Now there is a dedicated team based in the 5th division to handle solely clean and liens, comprised of a foreman, four laborers and a truck driver when needed. <br>If there is a private property in your neighborhood that you believe would qualify for this program, please call 311. | 23/10/2020 15:45:22 |

| City Announces Blue Recycling Bins Coming This Fall | PITTSBURGH, PA (Oct. 26, 2020) Mayor William Peduto today announced the plans to distribute 32-gallon blue curbside recycling bins to City residents as part of the Bureau of Environmental Services’ first phase bin distribution. The first phase will cover the neighborhoods of Garfield, Highland Park, and East Liberty. Distribution of blue curbside recycling bins is scheduled to begin Nov. 2, 2020 and will cover 5,500 homes over the span of 10 days and is based on the bureau’s Monday central collection route. <br>Each bin will be scanned and linked to a service location and delivered with an information packet describing how to properly use the bin. In addition, each blue curbside recycling bin will be manufactured in Pennsylvania by Rehrig Pacific Company with at least 5% recycled plastic as part of the [Government Demand Champions Program](https://plasticsrecycling.org/recycling-demand-champions/government-demand-champions). This program exists to stimulate and drive domestic markets for recyclable plastics and thereby drives sustainable plastic recycling. <br>“Pittsburgh is adapting to a stronger culture of waste reduction and material reuse. Our strategic plan for purchasing and deploying blue recycling bins over three years will make that culture change more accessible and equitable for all,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Prior to receiving their new recycling bin, residents will receive a notification via U.S. Mail letting them know to anticipate their new blue curbside recycling container, along with information on what can and cannot be placed in the bin. The 32-gallon blue curbside recycling bins will consolidate recyclables into one container, making it more convenient for recyclers and the recycling crews who empty them. After receiving their new curbside recycling bins, it is important for residents to remember to put their recyclables in their bins loose and not bagged. This will support the City’s efforts to reduce contamination (when non-recyclables make it into recycling bins), save on costs, and provide high-value recyclables to the circular economy. <br>The current $500,000 investment through the City’s 2020 budget is matched by a grant from The Recycling Partnership, a national nonprofit that works to transform community recycling programs to increase access to recycling and improve the quality of recyclables in the recycling stream. The Recycling Partnership will provide technical assistance, education, and outreach resources for Pittsburgh. <br>“The Partnership is excited to respond to Mayor Peduto’s plan to help Pittsburgh transition away from a bag-based recycling program into a bin-based one by offering to match Mayor Peduto’s proposed investment dollar for dollar,” said Chris Coady, Director of Community Programs for The Recycling Partnership. "By partnering with the City of Pittsburgh, The Recycling Partnership will boost the City's ability to move toward a more efficient and effective program, allowing residents to recycle more, better. A move away from blue bags is a perfect complement to the City's 'Better Recycling, Better Burgh' effort to encourage citizens to collect recycling in bins and know what is and isn't recyclable in those bins."<br>The three-year bin distribution details are posted on [https://pittsburghpa.gov/blue-bin-info/](https://pittsburghpa.gov/blue-bin-info/). Interested residents can learn more information through that link or by contacting 311 by phone at 412-255-2621, Twitter at @PGH311, or [pittsburghpa.gov/311](https://pittsburghpa.gov/311/)<br>This initiative will expand on Pennsylvania Resources Council’s initiative that has provided Pittsburgh residents with more than 10,000 blue bins and recycling education since 2015. Residents are encouraged to continue using their current bin from the nonprofit or one they already purchased for recycling overflow and storage as long as it’s under 35 gallons. <br>The Mayor is proposing an additional $500,000 in capital funding to continue buying and distributing bins citywide for residents who receive service from the Bureau of Environmental Services. The 2021 funding would be subject to approval by Pittsburgh City Council. <br>As a reminder the following recyclables are accepted for single stream curbside collection by the City:<br>- Cardboard, flattened and place into your bin or another box if needed<br>- Glass bottles jugs and jars, caps and lids removed<br>- Aluminum and steel cans<br>- Mixed paper such as junk mail, newspapers, old books and cereal boxes<br>- Empty plastic bottles, jugs and jars, caps and lids removed<br>To learn more about to how improve recycling in our community, please visit [https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/residential-recycling](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/residential-recycling) to watch our handy Recycling Guide. <br>###<br>**About The Recycling Partnership**<br>The Recycling Partnership is a national nonprofit organization that leverages corporate partner funding to transform recycling for good in states, cities, and communities nationwide. As the leading organization in the country that engages the full recycling supply chain from the corporations that manufacture products and packaging to local governments charged with recycling to industry end markets, haulers, material recovery facilities, and converters, The Recycling Partnership positively impacts recycling at every step in the process.

| Mayor Peduto Calls for Moment of Silence and Reflection Tuesday | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 26, 2020) Mayor William Peduto is calling on all in Pittsburgh to hold a moment of silence and reflection at 9:54 a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday, October 27, exactly two years after the shooting at Tree of Life synagogue.<br>"My thoughts continue to be with everyone impacted by this senseless tragedy. May the memories of our lost community members continue to be a blessing," Mayor Peduto said. | 26/10/2020 08:50:57 |

| I&P Director Santiago Garces to Take New Opportunity in South Bend | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 26, 2020) Innovation and Performance Director Santiago Garces is returning to a government role in South Bend, Ind., where he served before coming to the City in Pittsburgh in 2018. <br>Garces is going to become the Executive Director of Community Investment in the city, where he previously served under former Mayor Pete Buttigieg. His resignation from I&P is effective November 9, whereupon Heidi Norman will be named Acting Director. <br>“Santi had one of the hardest jobs in the City of Pittsburgh and accomplished more than I could have imagined in only two years. I wish him the best back in South Bend,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>Garces looked back on this time in Pittsburgh this way: <br>“Upon my arrival to the City, it was clear that the Department was a national leader in many aspects – but that the technical debt accrued over several decades was creating major operational issues for other Departments. After listening to Department leaders, visiting several city facilities, and hearing from the City Council regarding the many challenges, I put together a 6-point plan to remediate these major issues. My approach was to systematically evaluate different components of the operation, invest in our team to build organizational strength, develop multi-year plans that focused on financial and operational sustainability, and execute with diligence. <br>Working through the bureaucracy and through a global pandemic – along with thousands of smaller emergencies - made the rewarding work difficult at times, but all throughout my tenure, I have tried my best to build trust  by being honest of the work that needed to be done, and then to invest that trust and see it return dividends through execution. <br>Our six-point plan was: <br>1.Implement a Technology Refreshment program<br>Starting in 2019, we set the standard of replacing all PCs once they reach 4 years – whenever the warranty of the device runs out. The City now has budgeted for refreshing both PCs and MDTs for the next 4 years, and established partnerships with Dell and Panasonic that enable the devices to come already configured for the usage of Departments. Even with delays caused by the pandemic, the Department has replaced the oldest 1/3rd of the PC fleet, with an average age over 6 years since July of this year. In October, we kicked off the project to start the implementation of the first phase of device management. <br>2\. Invest in our team <br>Since 2019 we reorganized the Department according to best practices from the public and private sectors, establishing specialized functional units for infrastructure, applications, devices, cybersecurity, and other innovation and performance functions. We started the development of professional skills and competencies matrices per team to support the development of technical skills. <br>3\. Invest in our technical infrastructure <br>The City conducted a network assessment in late 2019, and started remediating issues in 2020. In 2020 we will have rewired the City County Building, the largest City owned facility providing new wiring closets, Wi-Fi, and new wires which are 10,000 times faster than the existing ones. These project will continue in the next few years. The City also announced the establishment of NetPGH, a city-wide fiber network that will provide highly available and resilient connectivity to all City facilities, transportation, and public safety infrastructure. The City conducted an assessment of its Active Directory environment and remediated key vulnerabilities by implementing best practices. The City is finalizing a cloud assessment and procurement RFP that will enable access to state-of-the-art computing resources in a cost efficient way, especially helpful when there are unforeseen needs to increase storage or compute needs in short periods of time. The City awarded a network monitoring and managed services contract to our partners at ePlus, allowing us to detect issues with the network before they impact our users. <br>4\. Establish a software applications roadmap and strategy <br>The City has established application standards including lifetimes for applications, commitments for support, and other features that address pain points. The City has a first draft of an applications roadmap and has been working with Departments to rationalize and optimize their changing needs based on the investments the City already has made or will make in the future. By 2021 the applications team will have repurposed about $750,000 dollars of licensing more optimally. The Department has also lead the largest efforts of data collection for assets in the right of way including streetlights and traffic lights that can be used for the development of 5G. <br>5\. Follow best practices in IT service management <br>The Department trained and successfully certified 100% of its staff in ITIL foundations – best practices framework for service management. The Department organically established an ITIL team that has hosted over a dozen coffee chats to help the staff adopt best practices in service management. The Department established the first 2 versions of a service catalog, implemented change management, and made significant improvements to its asset management and incident management practices. <br>6\. Invest in cybersecurity <br>In January of 2020 we launched a new dedicated Cybersecurity team and promoted our first Chief Information Security Officer. The City has undertaken several assessments and has been collaborating with local and national partners to develop a risk-based approach to cybersecurity and to remediate and improve the posture of the City. The Department conducted city-wide cybersecurity training and awareness campaigns for the first time. In partnership with OMB, the Department procured cybersecurity insurance for the first time. The City has also implemented several best practice controls to improve the security of the entire system. <br>All organizations are a work in progress, and there is much to be done. But I have seen our team confront a global pandemic where half of all administrative staff in the City had to be provisioned to work remotely in less than two weeks. I hope that they will continue to receive the support they need to complete these goals as well as future challenges and opportunities.  <br>I am grateful for the opportunity to serve the Steel City.” <br>### | 26/10/2020 15:34:09 |
| DOMI Unveils New Downtown Bike Facilities | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 26, 2020) The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) has unveiled the latest Downtown bicycle facilities project. The project consists of multimodal street upgrades and a two-way dedicated bicycle track that runs on Stanwix Street from Third Avenue to Penn Avenue, down Penn Avenue and Liberty Avenue to the intersection of Commonwealth Place to connect the existing bicycle network to Point State Park. The new infrastructure connects the Three Rivers Heritage Trail, Point Park University, Point State Park, and a significant portion of the Golden Triangle businesses to a dedicated bike track.  <br>The project includes enhanced signing and pavement markings, a sidewalk extension bus platform, curb and sidewalk restoration, and roadway milling and resurfacing. The bicycle track runs over two raised bus platforms to help transit riders safely access busses without vehicles having to obstruct the bicycle track. Finishing touches will be completed in November, which include traffic signal updates and associated electrical work. Users are advised to follow the temporary instructional signage until these installations are complete.  <br>“The Downtown bicycle project is another critical link in a complete network,” said DOMI Director Karina Ricks. “These new bike facilities give the people of our city the opportunity to safely access major employment and cultural areas with the affordable, sustainable and enjoyable mode of travel by bicycle.” <br>The project provides a connection through Downtown for already-existing bicycle infrastructure to promote the safety of all commuters, including the estimated 1,100 bicycle commuters, and those using the tracks for recreation. The road improvements promote the safety of all commuters whether they are public transit riders, vehicle operators, bicyclists, or pedestrians.  <br>The project also connects to the [Great Allegheny Passage](https://gaptrail.org/), a hiking and bicycle trail that runs 150 miles between the Point and Maryland that brings thousands of people to Pittsburgh each year. This new bicycle track connection will allow trail users to safely access and navigate Downtown Pittsburgh to explore the city, amenities, and businesses.  <br>This phase of the project has been in development since 2015 with design in 2018 and construction from June to November 2020. DOMI worked with agency and community partners including PennDOT, BikePGH, Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, and Friends of the Riverfront. Construction cost $758,746 and included design by Mackin Engineering Company, construction management by Michael Baker International, and prime contracting by A. Merante Contracting. <br>Additional information for the project can be found on the [project page](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7875_GAP_to_the_Point_12_03_19.pdf).  <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11904_GAP_Map_2.JPG)<br>The new bicycle facilities are indicated in the dashed orange line. | 26/10/2020 11:05:23 |

| City and PWSA Seeking Proposals for Innovative Citywide Stormwater Management Master Plan | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 28, 2020) The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) and the City of Pittsburgh announced their plans to release a Request for Proposals (RFP) to develop a comprehensive stormwater master plan for Pittsburgh. The RFP will seek to engage a visionary project team to develop a global model using the p4 framework of People, Planet, Place, and Performance to provide an innovative, equitable, inclusive, and sustainable blueprint to address one of our region’s most challenging problems.  <br>Aging infrastructure and the impacts of climate change have created challenges for stormwater management in Pittsburgh. The increasingly frequent and intense rain causes the combined sewer system to overflow into rivers and streams, flood streets, and cause property damage and health concerns when basements back up with raw sewage. By creating a new comprehensive stormwater management strategy that meets the current circumstances and needs of Pittsburgh, PWSA and the City seek to improve water quality, alleviate flooding, reduce basement back ups, create jobs, and beautify neighborhoods for safer and more resilient communities.   <br>This stormwater management master plan will provide guidance for the short and long term, by  identifying priorities and milestones to implement within the next five years including a proposed stormwater fee, pending consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other regulatory mandates. It will also include a long-term outlook with milestones for the next 25 years.  <br>The RFP will require bidders to utilize the p4 framework to provide innovative strategies including the following: <br>- Recommend an approach that prioritizes collaboration of interagency partnerships and identifies opportunities to create a more equitable community through better stormwater management and job creation through the expanded use of green infrastructure.  <br>- Address all applicable regulatory requirements and identify best management practices that would incentivize and encourage private property owners to be part of the solution. <br>- Provide performance recommendations to balance the use of green and gray infrastructure, outline appropriate uses for green infrastructure to accommodate Pittsburgh’s difficult terrain, and determine the level of stormwater protection to provide across the city. <br>- Analyze other plans in place to recommend distinct outcomes that are beneficial to ratepayers and add value to the community through green infrastructure. It’s critical to consider the cost to ratepayers so that they are not paying twice for the same solution.  <br>“We are looking for a holistic approach to address Pittsburgh’s stormwater challenges,” stated Will Pickering, PWSA’s Executive Director. “Establishing a stormwater master plan will direct our energy and resources towards the most effective solutions for our ratepayers. We are looking forward to partnering with a visionary firm to guide us through this complex issue.”  <br>“Pittsburgh needs a comprehensive plan to address stormwater,” said Paul Leger, PWSA board chair. “Residents are all too familiar with the destruction it causes, and we can no longer allow it to damage property and risk lives. As solutions are identified, we must be very clear about the benefits and limitations ratepayers can expect.” <br>Issuing this RFP demonstrates a significant step in PWSA and the City of Pittsburgh’s leadership in community resiliency and sustainable stormwater management. The project has not been assigned a cost to elicit responses that are not constrained by a set funding amount. Instead, PWSA and the City will evaluate responses and present this funding opportunity to private partners, philanthropic organizations, and other government agencies who have expressed interest in a comprehensive approach to managing stormwater.  <br>PWSA and the City of Pittsburgh are committed to pursuing this critical innovative strategy and encourage interested parties to contact PWSA for more information about the RFP.

| City Launches Health, Safety and Violence Prevention Initiative | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 30, 2020)  Mayor William Peduto today announced policing and social services changes in the City of Pittsburgh to help ensure that all residents have the right resources and responders when facing crises.<br>Working in collaboration with the STOP the Violence Initiative headed by Councilmen Rev. Ricky Burgess and Daniel Lavelle, the City is adopting the Health, Safety and Violence Prevention Initiative, which will house the Office of Community Health and Safety and the Office of Community Services and Violence Prevention.<br>“These offices are at the center of how we are working to reimagine policing – where we’re able to create stronger public health and restorative responses to incidents that may have been seen as a sole public safety concern,” Mayor Peduto said.<br>The initiative follows the creation of the Office of Community Health and Safety [in June](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4052), to house social services, public health and social work experts to assist first responders in situations that require longer-term assistance, harm reduction support and other services; and the partnership with Allegheny Health Network’s [Center for Inclusion Health](https://www.ahn.org/services/medicine/center-for-inclusion-health) [announced in July](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4154) to build a new model for responding to the needs of those experiencing homelessness, problematic substance abuse and unaddressed mental health issues.<br>“We are extremely pleased to be working with the City of Pittsburgh on this important public health initiative which marks a significant milestone in achieving health equity for vulnerable and marginalized populations in our region,” said Dan Palka, Administrative Director, Program for Homeless and Urban Poverty Medicine, AHN Center for Inclusion Health. <br>It also follows the recommendations of the Mayor’s Community Taskforce for Police Reform [released earlier this month](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4389).<br>The Health, Safety and Violence Prevention Initiative will be headed by the City’s new Office of Community Health and Safety Manager Laura Drogowski and will work in partnership with the Department of Public Safety’s Office of Community Services and Violence Prevention, headed by Assistant Public Safety Director Shatara Murphy.<br>“While the Office of Community Health and Safety focuses on the alternative response we can have to public safety, the Office of Community Services and Violence Prevention will be focused on how we can be more restorative in our police practices,” Councilman Rev. Burgess said. “This office will coordinate innovative, evidence-based Public Safety programs and facilitate ongoing partnerships with faith and community-based organizations.”<br>The efforts will be supported by the STOP the Violence funding granted by City Council earlier this year, and employ staffers including Community Engagement Specialist, a Victims Assistance Coordinator, an Overdose Prevention Project  Coordinator and others. The initiative will also have the ability to issue micro grants to community groups that are working on violence disruption work.<br>“STOP the Violence will have the ability to give mini grants to community groups that are working on violence disruption work. We’ve seen the tremendous success of allowing communities to be supporting in coming up with their own solutions to violence reduction, and this initiative will leverage their work further,” Councilman Lavelle said. | 30/10/2020 09:49:29 |

| City, URA, and Housing Authority Host Walking Tour of Larimer Choice Neighborhoods Homeowner Assistance Program Homes | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 2, 2020) Mayor William Peduto and officials from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) held a walking tour event today to showcase some of the homes that received roof and façade improvements from the Larimer Choice Neighborhoods Homeowner Assistance Program (CNHAP).   <br>Larimer CNHAP was a program offered as part of the $30 million Federal Choice Neighborhoods Implementation (CNI) grant that was awarded to Larimer and East Liberty in 2013 by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The program began in 2016 and has provided grants up to $20,000 to 90 homeowners within the Larimer Choice Neighborhoods boundary to complete façade, roof, sidewalk, and other exterior repairs. The total funding for the program was $1.6 million from the CNI grant and community development block grants.   <br>The City, HACP, and URA worked with representatives from the community-based homeowner advocacy group Larimer Community Watchers and the Larimer Consensus Group to prepare the program’s guidelines and identify eligible homeowners. The URA administered the program and offered technical assistance to help owners identify contractors and facilitate inspection work throughout construction. <br>Additional funding was leveraged to help homeowners with interior repairs to address major health and safety concerns as a condition of CNHAP from the URA, Rebuilding Together Pittsburgh, Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (sponsored by PNC Bank), and Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (sponsored by Dollar Bank).  <br>One resident recipient, Eugenia Newman, said of the program: “I thought that the program was awesome. The program helped me and others to keep us in our homes. I tell my grandchildren that having a home is one thing, but being able to keep it up is another thing. I am very grateful for the assistance that the program provided and I give thanks to those who provided the funding.”  <br>Today’s walking tour showcased only a small sampling of the 90 homes renovated as part of the CNHAP. The tour also included three parks currently under construction as part of the Larimer Choice grant: Village Green, Larimer Playground, and Liberty Green. | 2/11/2020 14:08:36 |

| Pittsburgh to Join Baltimore City and Digital Harbor Foundation to Address Digital Divide Through an Innovative Rec-to-Tech Program Funded by the National Science Foundation | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 5, 2020)  The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded $1,515,430 to the Digital Harbor Foundation and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) on a collaborative Advancing Informal STEM Learning research proposal titled: _Rec-to-Tech: Understanding the Role of Rec Center Educators in Creating Maker-based Technology and Computer Science Learning Hubs for Urban Youth_. This three-year research grant will support innovative youth technology programs developed by the Digital Harbor Foundation to expand across recreation centers in Pittsburgh and Baltimore.  <br>This investment from the NSF seeks to further understanding of how to bridge the digital divide by researching the processes and challenges involved in establishing four sites in Baltimore (2) and Pittsburgh (2), delivering effective educator professional development training, and studying the impact of participating in technology-rich youth programs on the self-efficacy, creativity, and attitudes of youth and educators over a three-year period. In addition to the delivery of training for educators and localized program offerings for youth, the grant will support the development of an online Localization Toolkit that will support rec centers across the nation to use a similar approach to create local opportunities for even more youth. The Pittsburgh sites have not yet been determined as the Department of Parks and Recreation will work with the Digital Harbor Foundation to select sites based on the curriculum criteria, target age group and timeline.<br>"We know that the future of the economy will be rooted in advanced technology,” said Mayor William Peduto. “With a booming tech industry in our own backyard, it is critically important that we are creating pathways to economic success for all city residents and paying close attention to making sure that our city's young people have access to the tools necessary to prepare them for life sustaining careers. The partnership with Digital Harbor Foundation and the City of Baltimore will help to catalyze the tech transformation of our recreation centers and ensure that we are addressing the digital divide head on, in a equitable and sustainable way."  <br>“It continues to make me proud to see how Baltimore City Recreation and Parks (BCRP), under Director Reginald Moore’s leadership, has evolved and continues to raise the standard of recreation in our city,” said Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young. “The National Scientific Foundation study will improve how we, collectively, provide critical STEM programming to children in our cities. STEM education is our ‘now’ and such opportunities will open up our children’s future learning experiences, career skills, and livelihoods – thus becoming an effort for workforce and economic development for the youth and the City of Baltimore. I am thankful to partner with the Digital Harbor Foundation and the City of Pittsburgh who understand the importance of providing equitable STEM experiences and opportunities for our young people.” <br>Digital Harbor Foundation’s Rec-to-Tech model has been pioneered through the support of key partners and funders, including a prior NSF Award EAGER: MAKER: Developing a Model for Expanding Informal Tech Education for Underrepresented Communities through Makerspaces, as well as support from the Abell Foundation, The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, the Jacob and Hilda Blaustein Foundation, and others. <br>“While some of the original timeline of the proposed research grant may be impacted by the social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” noted Andrew Coy, executive director at the Digital Harbor Foundation and Principal Investigator on the research grant, “this multi-year multi-site community project represents an investment in our youth by reimagining space and the pivotal role rec centers can play in bridging the digital divide. We believe that the research from this project will have the potential to ripple across the country.”  <br>Dr. Foad Hamidi, assistant professor at UMBC and co-principal investigator on the grant, added that “from a research perspective, we are using an equity-based and participatory approach to learning that systematically supports the inclusion of community educators and youth in the design of their own learning spaces and experiences.”  <br>Advisory board members include individuals from the Association of Science and Technology Centers, National Recreation and Parks Association, STEM Next Opportunity Fund, Union Baptist Church, Remake Learning Network, and other organizations. External evaluation will be conducted by MN Associates, Inc. whose team will assess the Rec-to-Tech model's fidelity as well as its broader impact and sustainability after the grant is over.  <br>Digital Harbor Media Contact:  <br>Andrew Coy <br>(410) 402-4189 <br>andrew@digitalharbor.org | 5/11/2020 13:30:44 |

| City Accepting Applications for Snow Angels Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 5, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh’s Office of Community Affairs is now accepting applications for the 2020-2021 Snow Angels Program. This program pairs older adult residents and residents with disabilities with nearby volunteer Snow Angels to help them shovel and salt their sidewalk and property throughout the winter. Along with fostering stronger community relationships and relieving some of the stress that comes from snowfall or a freeze, Snow Angels make our sidewalks safer for those who are outside during the winter weather – like postal carriers, firefighters, police officers, and other neighbors. <br>To request help from a Snow Angel, neighbors must: <br>- Be at least 60 years old or have a physical disability <br>- Live within City of Pittsburgh limits <br>- Lack other resources (financial or family/friends nearby) to assist with snow removal <br>Volunteers and neighbors in need can register for the program online at [https://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels/](https://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels/) or by calling the City’s 311 Response Center. The 2019-2020 program saw over 276 neighbors matched with volunteers to help them manage the hardships of winter. <br>“We’re pleased that the Snow Angels Program has grown every year, but there are always more vulnerable residents who need help than volunteers,” said Mayor William Peduto. “I encourage Pittsburgh residents to sign up as a Snow Angel to help a neighbor in their community.” <br>The Office of Community Affairs will offer incentives throughout the winter season for individuals to volunteer on their social media accounts on Facebook (facebook.com/ocapgh), Twitter (@ocapgh) and NextDoor. Community-based organizations, companies or employers are encouraged to assist with volunteer recruitment in their communities by having volunteers mention the organization’s name when they register. The organization that recruits the most volunteers will win the 2020-2021 Golden Shovel award and other incentives, including gift cards from local businesses and free passes to Schenley Park Ice Rink, that will be announced later. <br>For more information or to find out more about how to help with volunteer recruitment, visit [pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels](http://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels), contact the Snow Angels Program at [snowangels@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:snowangels@pittsburghpa.gov) or call 412-255-0846. | 5/11/2020 09:53:15 |
| Milling and Paving Resumes Monday | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 6, 2020) Taking advantage of the last days of warm weather, the Department of Mobility and Infastructure will be milling and paving a few more streets in the City on Monday, November 9, and vehicle owners are reminded to move their vehicles from such streets.<br>The list of impacted intersections [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule). New streets set for resurfacing are: List, Schnuttgen, Cherryland, Federal, Cleat Way, Oliver Avenue, Monestary, Lethans and Eureka.<br>This year the City is investing nearly $15.7 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing, ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets, and repair of concrete, brick and block stone streets throughout the Pittsburgh.   <br>Roughly 27 miles of streets are being resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperation agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching will improve many miles more by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors.  <br>As many residents are staying indoors and sheltering in place, the City is making an extra effort to notify residents to move their vehicles to enable street resurfacing to proceed. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving [are posted on the DOMI website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/street-resurfacing) and will be publicized through city social media channels.   <br>Residents who have registered to receive telephone alerts from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will receive robocalls if their street is to be paved the following week (residents can sign up for alerts by 412-255-2423). Paving crews will be placing fliers on vehicle windshields 48 hours in advance. | 6/11/2020 10:26:59 |

| Mayor William Peduto Proposes 2021 Operating and Capital Budgets | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 9, 2020) Mayor William Peduto today delivered his proposed 2021 Operating and Capital budgets to City Council, and delivered his annual State of the City address. <br>The $564 million operating budget does not include tax increases and works to avoid layoffs and furloughs of City personnel.  <br>Due to COVID-19 the City has been forced to spend nearly all of the $120 fund balance that the Mayor and Council built up through their fiscal discipline the past seven years, and is joining cities nationwide seeking federal aid to help pay for the services and safety provided to residents through the ongoing pandemic. <br>“We made tough decisions to stop public events, close pools, senior centers and rec centers, but still watched as our coworkers and neighbors lost their livelihoods and too often their lives,” the Mayor said in his budget speech.  <br>“Our tax revenues cratered, and there is still no clear path forward to replace them. We listened to the pain expressed by neighbors who have been threatened by exclusionary and inequitable systems for generations, and we proudly declared that Black Lives Matter. <br>Despite all of this we kept our resolve during one of the most difficult years in American history. I’m here today to tell you that with your help and that of Pittsburgh’s residents, we’re going to have to do it all over again in 2021, but it is my hope we will emerge from next year even stronger,” he said. <br>The Office of Management and Budget estimates the City will have a $55 million operating deficit at the end of this year. Pittsburgh is required by law to have a balanced budget, so should the City not receive aid from Washington the proposed budget would require making $25.6 million in personnel cuts starting July 1, which is approximately the jobs of 634 employees. Other spending cuts and the depletion of most of the City’s reserves would be needed to further bridge the budget gap.  <br>The proposed budget includes shifting some funding and responsibilities from the Pittsburgh Police to the new Health, Safety and Violence Prevention Initiative, which will house the Office of Community Health and Safety and the Office of Community Services and Violence Prevention. This move will allow police to focus on their core function of keeping neighborhoods safe from crime, and it will mean full-time funding for Public Safety’s Group Violence Intervention program for the very first time. <br>“We are not defunding the police, but are re-funding our communities,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Despite proposed cuts in spending, investments in critical City needs and services will continue.  <br>This year the City: <br>- Upgraded 21 courts <br>- Upgraded 35 parks <br>- Upgraded seven playgrounds <br>- Received $1.5 million in grants for parks, senior centers and rec centers <br>And next year the City will invest a total of $125 million into capital projects including funding for: <br>- Park investments at Deer Pit, Bud Hammer, Enright, Arsenal,  Emerald View, Sheraden, and Kennard <br>- Strip District Rail Banking and the Allegheny Green Boulevard  <br>- Funding for Warrington, Jefferson, and Robert E Williams Rec Centers, as well as the Brighton Heights Senior Center <br>- A new spray park in Chartiers City  <br>- Continued record funding for landslide repairs including El Paso Street, Riverview Park and Parkwood Road <br>- Funding for EMS Diesel Exhaust Systems, Fire Station 19, and Stevens School Improvements <br>- $4 million for phase one of the transition of all our street lights to LEDs<br>The City will also be spending $17 million to repave 65 miles of streets in 2021. <br>Via the Mayor’s Office of Equity, the City has: <br>- Committed more than $10 million to the URA next year — double the funding of this year — to invest in affordable housing. Avenues of Hope and an equitable recovery plan from COVID-19, in addition to the annual $10 million for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund <br>- We leveraged more than $67 million in additional housing aid, helped Pittsburghers purchase their first homes, added additional affordable rental units and helped longtime homeowners stay in their homes and communities <br>- Approved Paid Sick Leave, which will go into full effect starting January 1, 2021  <br>- Received a record level of 9% low-income tax credits for affordable housing <br>- Implemented ACE Pgh to help those living in poverty with direct payments, planned for early 2021 in conjunction with the ONEPGH investment strategy <br>- Adopted the Avenues of Hope initiative with the URA and Councilmen Burgess and Lavelle to invest in historically diverse business districts <br>- Adopted the GARE (Government Alliance on Race and Equity) racial equity toolkit and training <br>- Approved $23 million in contracts to minority and women-owned businesses <br>- Adopted Financial Empowerment Centers that helped 557 people save $320,000  <br>- Created the LGBTQIA Commission <br>- Adopted an award-winning Rec2Tech program with Citiparks <br>- Distributed 46,000 free books to 4,000 children though the Dolly Parton Imagination Library <br>The draft budgets introduced today must be finally approved by the end of the year. Council is set to begin budget hearings with City departments and agencies starting November 18, begin its preliminary votes December 14 and take a final vote December 21. <br>All hearings are votes are being held virtually. <br>A copy of the Mayor's speech as prepared for delivery [is here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12071_2021_Budget_Speech.pdf).<br>A copy of the [Operating Budget is here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12065_2021_Mayor_s_Operating_Budget.pdf) and [the Capital Budget is here](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12066_Mayor_s_2021_Capital_Budget_11-09-20.pdf). | 9/11/2020 10:05:11 |

| Mayor William Peduto Announces Marshall Plan for Middle America | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 12, 2020) Mayor William Peduto joined mayors from across Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia to call for federal support for a green transition to climate-friendly industrial growth across the upper Appalachian region and the Ohio River Valley, an initiative they are calling the “Marshall Plan for Middle America.” <br>The Marshall Plan for Middle America (MP4MA) Roadmap is an independent, non-partisan, data-driven research document created through the joint scientific efforts of academic and policy researchers based at the University of Pittsburgh [Center for Sustainable Business](https://www.sustainablebusiness.pitt.edu/), the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the City of Pittsburgh, the Steel Valley Authority, the Heartland Capital Strategies Network, and the Enel Foundation. <br>“For generations, hard-working men and women across the Rust Belt have produced the resources that fueled the U.S. economy. Now, with those jobs and resources evaporating with the realities of climate change, it is time for the U.S. to give back,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Research led by the Center for Sustainable Business finds that the Ohio Valley stands to lose 100,000 jobs in the ensuing years as the fossil-fuel economy continues to decline in the face of the economic and environmental realities of superior, cost competitive renewable energy development. <br>The cities that are part of the Marshall Plan for Middle America initiative have made their contributions to the climate change fight — by adopting methods such as action plans, divesting from fossil fuels, pooling their procurement of renewable energy — but need the power of the federal government to help economically-challenged neighbors in the rural and suburban parts of the Appalachian region. <br>The initiative is named after the post World War II investment strategy — helmed by General George C. Marshall of Uniontown, Pa. — to  rebuild Europe and its economic and democratic institutions. Like post-war Europe, Middle America faces similar issues of decline, a shared crisis of aging infrastructure, obsolescence of business and government institutions, and the need for upskilling and reskilling of workforce.  <br>The same kind of investments are needed in our region now. The federal government has not made significant contributions to Pennsylvania and its neighbors since the adoption of the Appalachian Regional Commission more than 50 years ago. <br>The MPMA calls for $60 billion annually in public and private funds over the next decade through the following means: <br>- $15 Billion in federal assistance in the form of block grants to local governments for energy efficiency measures for commercial and residential building stock retrofits and conversions and public and private vehicle fleet transitions available annually from 2021-2030. <br>- $15 Billion in low interest loans and guarantees for zero carbon energy generation production.  <br>- $15 Billion in tax incentives for manufactures and labor cooperation for private, on shoring production of clean energy equipment and supply chain development. <br>- $15 Billion for workforce training, education and research and development of advanced clean energy technologies and applied materials science that advance circular economic systems applications  <br>A copy of the independent, nonpartisan research report on the MP4MA by the University of Pittsburgh Center for Sustainable Business [is available here](https://www.sustainablebusiness.pitt.edu/research/marshall-plan-middle-america).<br>### <br>**About the Roadmap:**<br>[The Marshall Plan for Middle America (MP4MA) Roadmap](https://www.sustainablebusiness.pitt.edu/research/marshall-plan-middle-america) is a non-partisan, data-driven research document created through the joint scientific efforts of academic and policy researchers based at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the City of Pittsburgh, the Steel Valley Authority, the Heartland Capital Strategies Network, and the Enel Foundation. The MP4MA Roadmap is intended to provide a platform for regional cooperation across the Ohio Valley without regard for the political party or institutional affiliation of any specific stakeholder. | 12/11/2020 08:34:28 |
| City of Pittsburgh Signs Partnership/Sister Cities Agreement with City of Glasgow | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 12, 2020) The Cities of Pittsburgh and Glasgow announced their exciting new partnership/sister city relationship today. A virtual signing ceremony was held today formalizing a long-valued relationship between the two cities and is the next step in creating a strong connection between Pittsburgh and Glasgow.  <br>Pittsburgh and Glasgow have a lot in common. Both cities are situated on rivers, were forged in an industrial past and are poised to led the way on shared goals around environmental, racial justice, and economic and social equity agendas. They are now poised to lead the world again on the shared goals of innovation, environmental sustainability, racial justice and economic and social equity in health, and wellbeing.<br>“The long-established Scottish connection to Pittsburgh has been strengthened in recent years as we’ve shared the challenges of industrial heritage, built a renewed strength through a shared resilience journey and now seek to collaborate further through a sister cities arrangement. We are working together to address issues of climate change, health inequality and building more equitable prosperity," Mayor William Peduto said.<br>The date of this historic signing ceremony is significant. In one year, Glasgow will host COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference November 1 – 12, 2021. A delegation led by Mayor Peduto will attend COP26 in Glasgow where a second, in-person signing ceremony will take place. The teams in Pittsburgh and Glasgow that has been working on this new partnership/sister city relationship and are developing an ambitious work plan that includes measurable outcomes that will be reported out to the attendees of COP26. <br>Leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken said: “Glasgow and Pittsburgh were titans of the industrial age – with global reputations for ships, built on the Clyde, and the mills that lined the rivers of the Steel City.<br>“Both endured very similar slumps in our fortunes as heavy industry faltered. Many thousands of jobs were lost; populations declined, and the health of citizens suffered.<br>“What is arguably more remarkable is the way our cities have fought back from these challenges over recent decades; with both drawing on their resilience to address the economic, social and physical legacies of our industrial past.<br>“We have already learned a lot from each other; but this partnership will draw Glasgow and Pittsburgh closer together than ever before – and provides an opportunity for us to show real leadership on the climate emergency and building back from the Covid-19 pandemic in a way that prioritises economic, social and environmental justice for all our people,” Leader Susan Aitken said. <br>Pittsburgh currently has Sister Cities in 18 different countries. Cities with active engagement beyond Glasgow include Saitama City, Japan; Bilbao, Spain; Wuhan, China; and Da Nang, Vietnam. Glasgow has recently established partner and frontrunner city relationships with Santiago, Chile and Berlin, Germany.<br>“Now more than ever it is important for cities to have strong global partners. By partnering with cities like Glasgow, Pittsburgh can promote our innovation economy to the world and open up opportunities for our region. We are excited to work with the team in Glasgow and look forward to a long and prosperous relationship” said Grant Ervin, chief resilience officer, City of Pittsburgh. <br>This new partnership came about with the assistance of the Sister Cities Association of Pittsburgh (SCAP). SCAP, like other like organizations across the US and world; seeks beneficial two-way partnerships with cities across the globe through economic, cultural and educational exchanges with cities that share commonalities, challenges and opportunities. <br>**ABOUT SISTER CITIES ASSOCIATION OF PITTSBURGH**<br>Sister Cities Association of Pittsburgh connects the Pittsburgh region with international partner cities to develop mutually beneficial relationships in the area of commerce, education and culture; and to work together to address and solve global challenges facing cities of tomorrow. | 12/11/2020 11:00:07 |

| Street Closures Next Week for Installation of Traffic Calming Measures on Maytide Street | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 13, 2020) The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is pleased to announce the installation of traffic calming measures on Maytide Street from Saw Mill Run Boulevard (SR 51) to Brownsville Road in Carrick.<br>Data collected during the summer indicated that 99% of vehicles traveling on Maytide Street exceed the posted speed limit of 25 mph, with an average speed of 36 mph. Coupled with a long crash history, this rate of speeding indicated a strong need for a traffic calming intervention.<br>Improvements include the construction of four speed tables on Maytide Street and traffic calming transverse pavement markings. Permanent signage and pavement markings will be installed to alert motorists of approaching speed tables. Speed tables are midblock traffic calming devices that raise the entire wheelbase of a vehicle to reduce its speed. Speed tables are longer than speed humps and flat-topped, with a height of 3–3.5 inches and a length of 22 feet. Speed tables are commonly used on collector streets with higher volumes like Maytide Street.<br>Work is scheduled for the week of November 16 and is expected to last two days. Hours of construction will be Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Residents should expect full closure of the street on Wednesday, November 18 and Thursday, November 19 (weather pending). Flaggers and police will be on site to assist resident access as possible.<br>We understand this may be a short-term inconvenience and we hope to work together with you in a professional and amicable manner for the long-term improvement of your neighborhood.<br>If you have questions about this project or other traffic calming projects, you may contact us by email at trafficcalming@pittsburghpa.gov, or by calling 3-1-1.

| Mayor Peduto and United WE's Appointments Project Partner to Increase Representation of Women on Pittsburgh Civic Boards | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 17, 2020) The Office of Mayor William Peduto and United WE today announced their collaborative partnership to increase the number of women on local boards and commissions through the [Appointments Project®](https://www.appointmentsproject.org/). Started in 2014, the Appointments Project® has successfully placed more than 140 women on boards and commissions, including 28 percent women of color.  <br>The award-winning Appointments Project, started by United WE, formerly the Women’s Foundation, serves as a talent bank, advisor and advocate for women seeking opportunities to lead their communities. The program was piloted in Kansas City and operates in dozens of cities throughout Missouri and Kansas, working to attract diverse applicants for appointed positions on boards and commissions.  <br>“I’m very pleased that of the 198 board and commissions appointments in Pittsburgh, 61% are female,” Mayor Peduto said. “This is promising, but still isn’t good enough. Our partnership with United WE and Appointments Project® will help us do even better to increase the number of women, including women of color, who are at the decision-making table of their communities.” <br>Mayor Peduto will be joined in partnership by community partners including [Chatham University Women's Institute](https://chatham.edu/centers/womens-institute/), [Gwens Girls](https://www.gwensgirls.org/) and [Executive Women's Council](https://www.ewcpittsburgh.org/).   <br>Based on a growing number of success stories, the pipeline of women leaders is growing rapidly and the program is being sought after by other cities. The program expanded to Fort Worth in August 2020 with the help of partners like Mayor Betsy Price. United WE plans to scale the project to additional cities over the next five years. The Appointments Project® fills a critical need in creating a pathway to work with elected officials and better community representation that leads to better lives for all.   <br>“Our research showed us that women don’t become civically engaged because they weren’t being asked. As a result, we created the Appointments Project® so local boards and commissions could reflect the communities they serve,” said Wendy Doyle, United WE President & CEO. “With the help of partners like Mayor Peduto, we are addressing the gender disparities in local leadership and able to make real changes in our communities.”  <br>Two public training events are planned for Monday, December 7, and Wednesday, January 13, at 12:00 p.m. EST. These workshops guide women through the process of applying for these positions and offer applicants for appointments. “We encourage and invite everyone to learn more and join us in unlocking women’s potential for civic leadership,” Mayor Peduto said.  <br>To learn more about the Appointments Project® and to sign up for these trainings, please visit [http://united-we.org/appointments-project](http://united-we.org/appointments-project).  <br>United WE Media Contact:  <br>Gina Meagher <br>Comms@united-we.org <br>About United WE <br>United Women’s Empowerment, or United WE (formerly the Women’s Foundation), aims to advance all women’s economic and civic leadership.

| Mayor Peduto Announces Pittsburgh Women's Pay Equity Month with New Report and Partnerships for Workforce Equity | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 18, 2020) Today, Mayor William Peduto joined members of the Office of Equity, Gender Equity Commission, American Association of University Women (AAUW) and workforce development and gender equity partners to honor Pay Equity Month with the release of the Gender Equity Commission [Workforce Equity](https://pittsburghpa.gov/gec/workforce-equity) Committee’s [report](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12188_Envisioning_Workforce_Equity_-_Companion_Concept_Paper_to_Closing_Pittsburgh's_Pay_Gap_-_FINAL_8-14-20.pdf) and Workforce Equity Initiative and the announcement of a new partnership with AAUW.  <br>Pay disparity disproportionately affects women and women of color. Representatives from the Gender Equity Commission calculated that November 6, 2020 is Black Women Pay Equity Day, or the day when a Black woman in Pittsburgh makes the same amount of money it took a white man to make in the 2019 calendar year. That means that it takes a Black woman 23 months to make the same amount of money a white man makes in 12 months on average. Nationally, according to the 2018 American Community Survey data, for each dollar a white man makes white women make 79 cents, Black women make 62 cents and Latina/Latinx women make 54 cents. That gap is wider in Pittsburgh where Black women make 54 cents when a white man makes a dollar.  <br>The Mayor’s Office and Gender Equity Commission are recognizing November as Pittsburgh Women’s Pay Equity Month because it is the month that all women in Pittsburgh have finally achieved the same pay as the average white man in Pittsburgh. Highlighting these disparities locally reflects the work and focus of the commission to acknowledge and support challenges facing our most disadvantaged residents and offers the ability to plan a way forward to achieve pay equity for all.  <br>In light of these pay equity disparities, the Gender Equity Commission’s Workforce Equity Committee has released the “Envisioning Workforce Equity” report as part of their Workforce Equity Initiative with research and recommendations specific to the Pittsburgh region. The report recommends a three-pronged approach to promoting pay equity through empowering individuals, engaging employers and improving policy.  <br>“We know from the ‘ [Pittsburgh’s Inequality Across Gender and Race](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10645__Pittsburgh's_Inequality_Across_Gender_and_Race_JULY_2020.pdf)’ report that Black women in Pittsburgh are disadvantaged across the board, and we see from Black Women Pay Equity Day data that includes employment,” said Mayor Peduto. “I want to thank the Gender Equity Commission’s Workforce Equity Committee for developing the Workforce Equity Initiative to provide guidance to empower women of color in our region to ensure that they have equal access to jobs. City government is committed to this change, but we can’t do it alone. I encourage Pittsburgh's top employers to join us in achieving pay equity as we continue to build a region for all where everyone's contributions are valued, and valued equitably.” <br>As part of the plan to empower individuals, the City announced today its partnership with AAUW to provide AAUW’s Work Smart training at no cost to City of Pittsburgh residents. Work Smart prepares women to know their market value and provides strategies to successfully and confidently negotiate a fair salary and benefits.  <br>“We want every woman to be able to articulate their value and negotiate a solid financial future for themselves and their families,” said Kim Churches, chief executive officer of AAUW. “We are thrilled to partner with the city of Pittsburgh’s Gender Equity Commission to bolster their commitment to empower women in Pittsburgh with AAUW Work Smart’s professional development tools and resources to create pathways for women’s equity in the workplace.” <br>“We applaud our partners in the City of Pittsburgh and its Gender Equity Commission for their commitment to eliminating the gender wage gap in their community,” says Gloria Blackwell, AAUW senior vice president of fellowships and programs, whose team is leading the initiative. “We know that it takes a three-pronged approach—advocacy and updating policies, working with employers and providing women with skills—in order to close the gender pay gap.” <br>The virtual, live workshop schedule is set to be released in January at [www.aauw.org](http://www.aauw.org/). AAUW’s free, award-winning [Work Smart Online, is immediately available to all Pittsburgh residents](https://aauw.us/pittsburgh). Those interested in promoting pay equity can become a facilitator, promote trainings in workplaces and communities, refer clients to trainings, integrate trainings into workforce development support services or [contact the Gender Equity Commission](https://pittsburghpa.gov/gec/contact-gec) to learn about more ways to partner.  <br>The Workforce Equity Committee announced two additional initiatives expected in 2021: the Workforce Equity Council and the Pittsburgh Workforce Equity Commitment. Both are intended to bring together employers and stakeholders from all industries to join a strategic alliance to close the gender pay gap and eradicate discrimination based on gender, race and sexuality in the workplace using data-driven indicators and measurements of progress. More details are expected to be announced early next year. | 18/11/2020 14:52:26 |

| OMB Improves Contracting Procedures for Local Businesses Owned by Women and People of Color | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 19, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Office of Management and Budget has changed its procurement systems to better meet the needs of local businesses owned by women and people of color when they do business with the City. <br>Through a Living Cities City Accelerator cohort on Inclusive Procurement, the City’s Office of Equity, Office of Business Diversity, and the Equal Opportunity Review Commission worked with OMB to get feedback from local businesses, and found the City could be doing a better job in publicly displaying future solicitations, and shortening the time between when a contract is awarded and executed. <br>“Equity is a priority for the City of Pittsburgh, and inclusive procurement is an opportunity for our city to recognize and understand the needs of our businesses owned by women and people of color and identify what tools they need to be successful,” [said Riley Stewart, OMB’s Senior Manager of Contracting](https://www.livingcities.org/blog/1460-how-pittsburgh-is-mobilizing-to-help-businesses-owned-by-women-and-people-of-color-in-a-time-of-great-uncertainty). <br>"When our disadvantaged businesses succeed and are awarded city contracts, our money is invested into our communities and our entire local economy is stronger," Mayor William Peduto said. <br>Government solicitations can be confusing and complex, so the City implemented a forecasting system so small businesses have more time to prepare or plan their proposals. <br>OMB worked with 19 City departments to develop a 12-month outlook of upcoming contracting needs, and merged them with future contract needs from City authorities, and updated them quarterly. This let businesses view upcoming contracts and bidding information in one spot, instead of having to search multiple websites. <br>OMB also worked to shorten the time between when a contract is awarded and executed, which further helped small businesses plan for income from contracts and the labor and other costs they would need to complete their work. <br>It also launched “Contract Connections: Bids for PGH,” an remote training series to help local, diverse small businesses learn how to participate in the City and other agencies’ procurement processes. <br>Businesses interested in contracting with the City can visit [OMB’s procurement site Beacon](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html) for further information. | 19/11/2020 14:23:17 |

Image courtesy of LaQuatra Bonci Associates_<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (November 19, 2020) Mayor William Peduto, City Councilman Daniel Lavelle and The Buccini/Pollin Group (BPG) — the commercial redeveloper of the $1 billion Lower Hill mixed-use district — today announced a series of local partnerships with Hill District residents to bolster project management, design expertise and community reinvestment. BPG and local partners the Pittsburgh Penguins confirmed plans to break ground on the 26-story FNB Financial Center in early 2021. <br>Additionally, BPG announced the opening of a new Pittsburgh office at the JLL Center at Tower Two-Sixty on Forbes Avenue, partnering with JLL, its commercial broker for the Lower Hill redevelopment. <br>The Lower Hill development team has been expanded to include four Hill District residents, intended to catalyze BPG’s neighborhood revitalization program in alignment with the Community Collaboration and Implementation Plan (CCIP) that was established in 2014 to guide equitable development on the Lower Hill: <br>- **Bomani Howze – Vice President for The Buccini/Pollin Group**. Hill District-based developer Bomani Howze has joined BPG as a Vice President with development management responsibilities in the Pittsburgh region, where BPG also owns the People’s Center office complex on the North Shore. Mr. Howze’s areas of focus will be to finalize planning approvals, further define commercial programming and expand the firm’s community engagement platform. Mr. Howze noted: “BPG has been a trailblazer in delivering projects of significant complexity and impact in Baltimore, Washington, Wilmington and other cities with neighborhoods pursuing equitable development similar to Pittsburgh’s Lower Hill District. I’m incredibly excited to join forces with BPG, the Penguins and our extensive, public-private partner network to bring long-promised opportunities to the Hill and to realize the possibilities of reinvestment in my community.” BPG’s Managing Partner Chris Buccini said: “We are delighted to solidify our presence in Pittsburgh by partnering with local developer and community builder Bomani Howze, establishing our development office above Market Square, and expanding our local team. Together, we will work to realize the tremendous potential for this special location.” <br>- **Dorin Dickerson – Director of Project Development for Pittsburgh Penguins**. The Pittsburgh Penguins have hired Dorin Dickerson, currently the Community Outreach Manager for Mascaro Construction Company, to serve as Director of Project Development for the Penguins on the Lower Hill development. Mr. Dickerson will coordinate closely with Mr. Howze and focus his efforts on project management, workforce development and community engagement.   <br>- **E. Holdings – M/WBE Consultant**. Pittsburgh-based E. Holdings, led by Hill District resident Irv Williams, has been engaged as the M/WBE consultant for the Lower Hill development. In that capacity, E. Holdings will focus on solidifying bridges between the development team and the minority and women-owned business community to enhance the inclusion of local, disadvantaged contractors and service providers in this transformational project. <br>- **Dr. Kimberly Ellis – Legacy Consultant**. Hill District historian and designer Dr. Kimberly Ellis has been engaged as the legacy consultant for the Lower Hill development. As she has in the adjacent I-579 CAP Park development project which is currently under construction, Dr. Ellis will channel historical context and diverse stakeholder perspectives to ensure that the development provides an inclusive, welcoming public open space – one that restores visual, recreational, commercial and pedestrian connections between the Hill District and the downtown along Wylie Avenue. <br>- **Lakeisha Byrd – Design Consultant**. Hill District resident and architectural design consultant Lakeisha Byrd has been selected to guide elements of the architectural work on the Lower Hill development. Ms. Byrd will work closely with Gensler, the architect of record for the development, and their landscape architect to enhance the physical and cultural connection between the development and the Hill District neighborhood. <br>- **Monaloh Basin Engineers – Site Survey Consultant**. Woman-owned, Pittsburgh-based engineering firm Monaloh Basin Engineers will provide a team to conduct a survey of the Lower Hill site’s first commercial phase. The resulting topographical analysis, boundary surveys and subdivision plans will support the broader design initiative of the planned commercial projects and public open space.  <br>- **AWK Consulting Engineers – Geotechnical Consultant**. Turtle Creek–based AWK Consulting Engineers, a certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE), will perform on-site geotechnical evaluations and design services for the site, documenting foundation requirements for the initial phases of commercial development.  <br>These initial contracting commitments have been released just as the project enters the pre-development home stretch in anticipation of a Q2 2021 groundbreaking. The project’s designer and builder will further enhance this local team as the effort continues to move forward. <br>"What sets the 28-acre project apart from others is that it will be led by and engages with local Black artists, companies and leaders,” Mayor Peduto said. “By working hand in hand with both community stakeholders and private developers, we are investing in a future that is directly built by its residents. I am proud of the work of our partners and collaborators on this critical work, and especially want to thank URA Executive Director Greg Flisram and Deputy Executive Director Diamonte Walker." <br>“It cannot be understated how critical these hires are. I have continually stated that this development should be to the explicit economic and social benefit of the African-American and Hill District community. Hiring four African-American firms that both live and are headquartered in the Hill District are monumental steps towards achieving both objectives,” Councilman Lavelle said. “What’s more, the complete set of firms hired will go a tremendous way in ensuring this is an equitable development centered with the concerns and needs of the residents of the Hill District not just in mind, but also in practice.  Lastly, I thank the Mayor and development team for recognizing the importance of equitable development and advancing these partnerships.”   <br>“I want to thank the Penguins and BPG for their commitment to the Lower Hill, as this development will have an immediate and positive economic impact on the Hill District neighborhood and create thousands of jobs to help with our recovery out of the pandemic,” said State Rep.

| Mayor Peduto Proposes COVID-19 Sick Leave | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 23, 2020) Workers in Pittsburgh impacted by COVID-19 will receive paid sick leave under legislation being introduced by Mayor William Peduto’s Administration to City Council today. <br>Such sick leave is currently offered under the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act, but is set to expire December 31. The Republican-controlled Senate has not extended the Act or agreed to other economic stimulus measures. <br>“Due to failed federal action, workers should not have to choose between their family’s health during a worldwide pandemic and their ability to pay their bills. In Pittsburgh we’re used to stepping up when Washington fails, and will do so again to protect our people from COVID-19,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Under the City’s legislation, COVID-19 paid sick leave would be handled separately from its existing Paid Sick Days requirements, which began taking effect this year. Under the new measure employees of businesses with 50 or more workers could receive up to 112 hours of paid sick leave due to impacts from COVID-19. <br>The pandemic sick leave would stay in place until the City’s COVID-19 Declaration of Emergency, which was issued in March, is lifted. <br>Today’s legislation says: <br>“WHEREAS, the City of Pittsburgh has an interest in collection of various tax revenues to provide basic and essential governmental services; and, <br>WHEREAS, the City of Pittsburgh has an interest in preventing spread of COVID-19 within and throughout the City of Pittsburgh; and  <br>WHEREAS, the exigent circumstances posed by COVID-19 require balancing those interests; and  <br>WHEREAS, the City of Pittsburgh finds it appropriate to mandate that employees receiving Paid Sick time under the Paid Sick Days Act should be provided such time immediately without need for accrual in the event that the use of Paid Sick time arises from COVID-19.” | 23/11/2020 09:37:10 |
| Love Your Block Program Awards Mini-Grants to 26 Neighborhood Community Organizations | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 23, 2020) The Office of Community Affairs’ 2020 Love Your Block Program awarded 26 $1,500 mini-grants this year to neighborhood and community groups throughout the City of Pittsburgh. Love Your Block is a City of Pittsburgh program that invites organizations to submit proposals to transform their blocks through designing local volunteer improvement projects with the support of city departments, including the Department of Public Works, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, and the Department of City Planning.  <br>The mini-grant awards fund the purchase of supplies for volunteer projects that engage neighbors and benefit the public. Project categories have included creating green spaces, maintaining community gardens, stormwater capture, enhancing parks, streetscaping, removing graffiti and litter, sprucing up pathways, and encouraging emergency preparedness.  <br>“I want to thank the Office of Community Affairs and city departments for facilitating Love Your Block, one of our key community-driven programs,” said Mayor William Peduto. “I’d like to especially thank our community groups for their leadership in designing creative projects that bring neighbors together to improve their blocks and promote pride in their neighborhoods.” <br>Due to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations were given the option to delay their projects until Spring of 2021. Five projects were implemented this year:  <br>![Photo of Friendship Community Group's pollinator garden on Fredericka](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12269_LYB_Friendship.jpg)<br>The Friendship Community Group planted pollinator gardens along Fredricka Street, an alley in Friendship. The gardens utilize native plants and support a thriving, natural ecosystem.  <br>![Volunteers at East Allegheny community garden](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12270_LYB_East_Allegheny.jpg)<br>East Commons Community Garden at Allegheny Commons park installed four new garden planters in common areas of the garden for decorative planting.  <br>![Project Love Coalition volunteer cleaning lots in the Hill District](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12271_LYB_Project_Love.jpg)<br>Project Love Coalition recruited neighborhood volunteers in the Hill District to remove debris from vacant lots and to maintain an existing community garden and green space to ensure a safe and clean place for the neighborhood to enjoy.  <br>![Volunteers working in Friendship's Octopus Garden](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12272_LYB_Octupus_Garden.jpg)<br>The Octopus Garden in Friendship built two new garden beds, placed soil in old and new garden beds, weeded and spread mulch, and designed and installed new rules for the neighborhood garden, which is an ongoing vacant lot project.  <br>![Volunteers working on South Side Park Mission Street entrance project](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12273_LYB_South_Side_Park.jpg)<br>Friends of South Side Park built a native garden bed to help draw attention to the Mission Street entrance of South Side Park. <br>"It's been incredible to see the resilience, creativity, and dedication from community members to make their neighborhoods a better place to live,” said Leah Friedman, manager of the Office of Community Affairs. “Thank you to everyone who took the time to participate and take on the challenge of Love Your Block this year.” <br>Emily, a Love Your Block participant from the Friendship neighborhood, said “We’ve felt a great sense of pride from many neighbors who have either participated in creating the gardens or those who simply enjoy them. Typically, alleys seem to be forgotten, but now folks are excited to have Fredericka Street be highlighted in this way.  We’ve seen numerous people strolling down the street, stopping to take pictures of the flowers and the bees, butterflies and birds that visit. It has been wonderful to see people enjoying these small patches of nature, particularly during this stressful time.”  <br>For more information on the Love Your Block program, please visit [pittsburghpa.gov/oca/lyb](http://pittsburghpa.gov/oca/lyb), call 412-255-4773 or email [eric.williams@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:eric.williams@pittsburghpa.gov).  <br>Sign up for the Office of Community Affair’s newsletter at [newsletter.pittsburghpa.gov](http://newsletter.pittsburghpa.gov/) to be notified when applications open for Love Your Block 2021. | 23/11/2020 13:33:30 |
| City of Pittsburgh Releases First Voluntary Local Review of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 24, 2020) Mayor William Peduto has announced the release of the City of Pittsburgh’s first [Voluntary Local Review (VLR)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12240_Pittsburgh_VLR_2020_Draft_FINAL.pdf) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). <br>In 2019, the [City of Pittsburgh became the second city in the country to formally integrate the SDGs](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=3362) into city operations, best practices and goals. The SDGs are 17 universal goals to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and improve the quality of life for every human being. Mayor Peduto was joined by public, private and nonprofit partners, who pledged their support and made similar commitments for their organizations. <br>First developed in New York City, a VLR is a local government’s assessment of progress towards the individual targets of the SDGs. Pittsburgh’s VLR was developed and conducted in the summer and fall of 2020 to focus on city government operations. Data was collected through examining city reports, reviewing online surveys and hosting discussions with city and authority personnel to determine how the City’s existing work aligns with individual SDGs.  <br>The report classifies city work, projects and initiatives under each SDG outcome to produce an understanding of what work is contributing to what outcome. This also helps to identify opportunities for inter-department and cross-sector partnerships as multiple departments or organizations may be working toward common goals. The City will use this periodic report to hold itself accountable to its work and operations supporting the SDGs and measure its progress towards achieving the SDGs. <br>“Today we release our first VLR, another step towards a continuous cycle of improvement to create a culture of measurement and accountability within city government,” Mayor Peduto said. “We will align our work to the SDGs to make sure that our efforts are always working towards the 17 common goals that improve life for all of our residents: goals such as no poverty, zero hunger, reduced inequalities, good health and wellbeing. We hope this will provide a blueprint model for other organizations and industries within our region to join us in measuring their work against the SDGs. We will have a greater impact when we all work together.” <br>“It's fantastic that Pittsburgh is joining the global movement of cities who are publishing their progress towards the SDGs,” said Alexandra Hiniker, the current Executive Fellow for Sustainability Initiatives at Carnegie Mellon University who previously worked for the City of New York and helped develop the first VLR. “When I created the concept of the VLR in 2018, I knew it would only be successful if cities around the world participated.”   <br>Collectively achieving the SDGs by 2030 in Pittsburgh will require cooperation and participation of external partners to create strategies for implementing the SDGs to improve outcomes for all residents in the region. The City is partnering with nonprofits, universities and philanthropies to align internal and external efforts toward ensuring a thriving Pittsburgh for all, with the VLR serving as a periodic report card on the progress. <br>One such partner is Coro Pittsburgh, whose Executive Director Selena Schmidt said, “Thanks to the City of Pittsburgh’s leadership to develop a VLR, Coro can incorporate these goals and measures as baselines to enhance our capacity building work with all of our nonprofit, private sector, innovation, and government partners- expanding the reach of the SDGs as a framework for collective impact.”  <br>Coro Pittsburgh and other external partners like The Forbes Funds are revising their business models and processes to position their organizations to lead this work. Fred Brown, President and CEO of The Forbes Funds explained, “As an intermediary foundation, The Forbes Funds continues to align our work to the SDGs to not only address the inequities within our region, but to innovate and empower the nonprofit sector to play a role in driving solutions. The City of Pittsburgh has made notable internal progress toward each of the 17 goals, however we know that this global work requires a network of local partners to support the most resilient communities and populations in our region.”  <br>Adopting the SDGs and conducting the VLR demonstrates Pittsburgh’s leadership in thinking global and acting local. It connects our communities throughout the region by promoting equitable and resilient solutions for all while also plugging Pittsburgh into a global support network of cities looking to lead the way to a sustainable future.   <br>“We are witnessing one more great American city join a growing global movement grounding this extremely relevant agenda locally. Together with the citizens of Pittsburgh, local stakeholders, including Carnegie Mellon and other universities, local NGOs, the private sector, and city government, this collaboration will serve as a model eco-system for how to create more peaceful, just and inclusive communities that benefit all Pittsburghers,” said Sarah Mendelson, who heads CMU’s Heinz College in Washington, D.C. As a former senior official at the U.S. Agency for International Development and then as an ambassador to the United Nations, she helped shape and then advocate for the SDGs.   <br>Pittsburgh is a participant of a multi-city leadership convening on the SDGs led by the Brookings Institute along with New York, Los Angeles, Orlando and a host of international cities. Tony Pipa, Senior Fellow, Global Economy and Development at Brookings Institute said, “Congratulations to the City of Pittsburgh on producing its first VLR. Its seriousness in measuring its progress against the SDGs reflects the city’s commitment to equity, inclusivity, and sustainability, reinforcing its leadership as one of the top places to live and visit in the U.S.”   <br>Mayor Peduto will be sending a resolution to City Council requesting a formalized adoption of the SDGs to serve as a framework for city policies, practices and procedures.  <br>The City’s adoption of the SDGs and the development of the VLR is a cross-departmental partnership between the Department of City Planning, the Mayor’s Office of Equity, the Commission on Human Relations, and the Gender Equity Commission. <br>The City of Pittsburgh’s first Voluntary Local Review of the UN Sustainable Development Goals can be viewed [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12240_Pittsburgh_VLR_2020_Draft_FINAL.pdf). <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12282_SDGs.png) | 24/11/2020 11:39:35 |

| City Opens New Washington Boulevard Trail | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 25, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure has opened a new asphalt trail along Washington Boulevard, connecting the existing bike lanes on Negley Run Boulevard to the Bud Harris Cycling Track. The project creates a safe and separated shared-use path for pedestrians and cyclists to travel along Washington Boulevard, where there is no existing sidewalk. Tree plantings and other landscaping were also included in the project.<br>Work included:<br>- Expansion of sidewalk along Negley Run Boulevard for shared bike/pedestrian use, including reconstruction of some existing sidewalk slabs<br>- New ADA ramps, pedestrian signals, and pavement markings crossing Negley Run Blvd at Washington Blvd<br>- Asphalt shared-use path running parallel to Washington Blvd<br>- Repaving of existing access road between the Zone 5 Police Station and the Fire Bureau training facility for shared use, and construction of a concrete sidewalk through that area<br>- New ramps and crosswalk markings at Zone 5 secondary driveway<br>- New ramps, pedestrian signals, and crosswalk markings at the Zone 5 parking lot/Highland Drive intersection with Washington Blvd<br>- Tie-in to Bud Harris Cycling Track through the existing parking lot<br>- Reconstruction and cleanup of driveways along trail path, with new pavement markings at the crossings<br>- Other signage and pavement markings in support of the trail<br>- Tree plantings and other landscape improvements<br>Before the project, there was no safe way to travel along Washington Boulevard for pedestrian and bike travelers other than navigating the grass and parking lots of the fire and police facilities. In coming years the City hopes to continue the trail system toward the Allegheny River as further funding becomes available. DOMI is also working with PWSA and the Army Corps of Engineers to incorporate trails in the stormwater project(s) they are pursuing on the northern side of the cycling track.<br>The cost of the project was $678,974.75.

| City Updates COVID-19 Safety and Service Delivery Efforts | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 2, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh has been working on pandemic planning since before mitigation efforts began in March, and continues to offer support to residents and employees during the latest spike in COVID-19 infections. <br>Though numbers change daily, roughly 10% of the City’s 3,300-person workforce is in quarantine due to symptoms or contacts with other infected individuals, with a small group that has tested positive. When workers at Public Safety have been exposed to serious cases of COVID-19 they have been given temporary emergency shelter away from their families and coworkers. <br>“City workers are continuing to deliver services, safely, to residents even during this worsening pandemic. We will continue to review our COVID-19 response efforts as cases are expected to surge this winter,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>Essential employees are required to wear masks at all times and socially distance as much as possible, and are subject to health screenings at the start of all shifts. Subject to Governor Tom Wolf’s orders, all telework-eligible employees are working from home, and must coordinate schedules if they need to go into the office, to make sure few employees are in the office at the same time. <br>Each City department tracks cases, return to work dates, and designates coworkers to check in daily with those who are COVID-19 positive or quarantining. Official travel has been suspended but employees who travel for personal reasons must file reports with their supervisors when they return — they are reviewed by Emergency Medical Services and if deemed high-risk they are required to quarantine and get tested. <br>All City facilities are cleaned regularly, and if department officials request extra cleaning it is provided the same day. <br>With the City entering snow season, protocols are in place that require only one driver in each Department of Public Works truck, who is health-screened before starting work. Should a significant COVID-19 outbreak occur impacting snow removal service, the City has outside contractors on standby to assist. <br>Under the leadership of the Department of Parks and Recreation (Citiparks), those suffering from food insecurity have been serviced continually since the start of the pandemic, with the City issuing eligible residents almost 350,000 meals and counting. <br>With the assistance of Parkhurst Dining and the United Way of Southwestern PA the City has distributed approximately 265,000 Grab & Go meals to children and 81,000 meals to seniors. An additional 3,600 boxes of produce have been distributed to seniors at Healthy Active Living Centers since mid-August. Those distributions are continuing twice per week. <br>The United Way of Southwestern PA and Parkhurst have further provided approximately 1,340 family style meals including 190 turkey dinners before Thanksgiving. Another Family Dinner distribution is planned for mid-December, with further details to be released soon. <br>Citiparks continues to support families with take-home enrichment activities for kids PreK-5th grade. Some 460 families are registered for KidSMART Club its weekly STEM based activity kit distribution. Through the KidSMART Club over 5,000 kits will be distributed to help families provide quality, enrichment at home. Combined with the department’s CitiCamp @ Home, it has distributed more than 9,000 at-home learning kits. <br>With the assistance of the Global Links Community Partners program, Citiparks lately distributed the following items at senior centers for those in need:  <br>- 1,200 Children’s Diapers <br>- 2 Cases of Clorox Wipes <br>- 96 Bottles of Hand Sanitizers <br>- 2,000 Face Masks <br>- 434 Adult Briefs <br>- 108 Adult Pads <br>- 36 Wipes <br>- 1 Case of Kleenex <br>- 12 Jugs of 64 oz Hand Sanitizer <br>- 36 Tubes of Skin Protective Paste <br>Finally, Hygiene for the Homeless is an ongoing effort at the South Side Markethouse supporting those who are housing displaced. They are issuing clothing, coats, toiletries, small blankets, shoes and more to people in need, and are looking for donations of these items as well. | 2/12/2020 13:19:08 |
| City of Pittsburgh Receives Score of 100 in Municipal Equality Index for Fourth Year | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 3, 2020) The Office of Mayor William Peduto has proudly announced today that for the fourth year in a row, the City of Pittsburgh has scored 100/100 on the Human Rights Campaign’s [Municipal Equality Index Scorecard](https://www.hrc.org/resources/municipal-equality-index) (MEI).  <br>The 2020 MEI scored 506 U.S cities of varying sizes on 49 criteria that examine how inclusive municipal laws, policies and services are for LGBTQ+ people who live and work there.

While the final score cannot exceed 100, the City of Pittsburgh received 10 additional flex bonus points for additional equality measures such as providing employee domestic partner benefits, providing services to LGBTQ+ youth and appointing openly LGBTQ+ leaders.  <br>“We are proud to be recognized by the Human Rights Campaign with our 2020 MEI Score of 100,” said Mayor William Peduto, “Thanks to the Office of Equity and our city departments, we have continued to make strides toward being a more inclusive and welcoming city.”  <br>“Pittsburgh is honored to have been scored 100/100, but this score does not mean that the work stops,” said City of Pittsburgh Chief Equity Officer and Deputy Chief of Staff Majestic Lane. “To be truly equitable and inclusive, we will continue to collaborate with the LGBTQ+ community to identify and create goals, policy, services, resources and laws to make sure that our city is equitable for all.” <br>The City of Pittsburgh’s full MEI scorecard can be found [here](https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/MEI-2020-Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania.pdf?mtime=20201202124506&focal=none). | 3/12/2020 11:38:16 |

| City Receives $10 Million Federal Grant to Preserve Mount Washington Hillsides | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 7, 2020) Mayor William Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) have won a nearly $10 million grant to remediate landslide conditions along historic Grandview Avenue in Mount Washington. <br>The $9,998,250 grant is from the Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency. <br>“Support for infrastructure upgrades is one of the most important ways the federal government can partner with Pittsburgh, and will help preserve this historic asset beloved by residents and tourists alike for years to come,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>"This project will help stabilize the slopes of Mount Washington to ensure that Pittsburghers’ safety. I have been working for some time to secure federal funding to address landslide threats in Mt. Washington and other parts of our community, so I’m very pleased that the city was awarded the funds to move forward with this vitally important project,” said U.S. Representative Mike Doyle. “I will continue to work to secure additional federal assistance for preventing and remediating landslides in Pittsburgh.” <br>Following some 10 years of repeated landslides, the grant will fund landslide mitigation through the construction of retaining walls and/or engineered slopes to repair landslide damage and ensure future slope stability at three sites located on the Mount Washington hillside. <br>The project will include collecting water to avoid seepage into underlying soils, which will help in stabilizing the slopes and reducing future erosion. The project area includes three locations along Grandview Avenue, Greenleaf Street, and William Street.  <br>“Mount Washington and Duquesne Heights residents have long shared beautiful Grandview Avenue with others, and will now finally get the return in investment they deserve. These upgrades should make the avenue and other streets around the neighborhood safe for generations,” Council President Theresa Kail-Smith said. “I want to thank Senators Casey and Toomey, and Congressmen Doyle and Lamb, for their support of this vitally important project.” | 7/12/2020 11:09:50 |

| City Receives State Grant for Electric Vehicle Fleet Chargers | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 9, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh has received a $189,403 grant from the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority as part of their COVID-19 Restart Grants. The grant will be used to purchase and install 30 Level 2 chargers and a DC Fast Charger for the city’s growing electric vehicle fleet.  Level 2 chargers will typically fully charge a vehicle plugged in for 6-8 hours or overnight for the City feet, and DC Fast chargers deliver a faster charge in 20-25 minutes.  <br>As part of the city’s [Climate Action Plan](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/climate-action-plan) goals to reduce transportation-related emissions, increase vehicle electrification and convert to a 100% fossil-fuel free fleet, this grant will fund the installation of 30 additional electric vehicle chargers and required back end electrical infrastructure for the city’s fleet of sedans that park at the Second Avenue Parking Lot and a DC Fast charger at the City Garage. Using this grant with a previously awarded Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Alternative Fuel Incentive grant, the Second Avenue Parking Lot will become the City’s main electric fleet charging depot, where a total of 70 electric vehicles are on track to be converted and charged by 2026.  <br>The City currently has 26 electric vehicles that are used by the Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections and other departments that charge at 10 solar charging stations at the Second Avenue Parking Lot and 9 chargers at the City's Motorpool Lot.  The 26 electric sedans currently produce an annual savings of roughly $13,640 in avoided fuel costs, 8,812 gallons of gasoline, and 72.1 metric tons of carbon dioxide.  <br>The Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority is an independent public financing authority that supports clean, advanced energy projects in Pennsylvania. As part of the COVID-19 Restart Grants, they awarded over $1.7 million in grants to 11 projects statewide that promote energy efficiency, solar energy, high-performance building and electric vehicle charging projects that were halted by the pandemic.  A full list of grants is available [here](https://www.ahs.dep.pa.gov/NewsRoomPublic/articleviewer.aspx?id=21891&typeid=1). | 9/12/2020 12:18:03 |

| HUD Awards $450,000 Planning Grant for Fineview Citizens Council & Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh to Develop Transformational Plan for Allegheny Dwellings, Fineview & Perry Hilltop | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 16, 2020) The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Assistant Secretary of Public and Indian Housing R. Hunter Kurtz announced a $450,000 planning grant award to the Fineview Citizens Council (FCC), the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP), the City of Pittsburgh and the Allegheny Dwellings community that will stimulate affordable housing and economic development in the neighborhoods of Fineview and Perry Hilltop.<br>Allegheny Dwellings Tenant Council President Cheryl Gainey agreed on the scope of the impact, saying that, “This will be a great opportunity to engage our neighbors and plan for a better future in our community.”<br>The grant is one of 11 awards totaling $4,910,000 million funded through HUD’s Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, which helps local leaders craft comprehensive, homegrown plans to revitalize and transform neighborhoods across the country. HUD’s Choice Neighborhoods Initiative promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming neighborhoods struggling to address the interconnected challenges of distressed housing, inadequate schools, poor health, high crime, and lack of capital. <br>“We’d like to thank HUD for the generous grant and thank our community partners in Allegheny Dwellings and Fineview and at the Housing Authority for their hard work to bring this investment to their neighborhood,” said Mayor William Peduto. “HUD’s Choice Neighborhoods Initiative has brought such success to the redevelopment of our communities in Pittsburgh because it puts the community at the center of community planning and development so that the development meets their needs.”  <br>“The Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant is great news for the residents of Allegheny Dwellings and the surrounding community,” said HACP Executive Director Caster D. Binion. “The award demonstrates the shared commitment of the HACP, Mayor Peduto & the City of Pittsburgh, the Fineview Citizens Council, The Buhl Foundation/ One Northside Coalition, HUD and an entire network of community stakeholders throughout the neighborhoods of Allegheny Dwellings, Fineview and Perry Hilltop.”<br>“This network – which I like to call ‘Team Pittsburgh,’” Binion continued, “came together to develop a cohesive plan and to secure the funding needed to advance our goals. Now that we have secured HUD’s support, the real work is about to begin and I’m confident that we are up to the task. I look forward to continuing to build upon our successful redevelopment of Sandstone Quarry and working with the winning team that helped pull together to earn this award.”<br>Choice Neighborhoods is HUD’s signature place-based initiative and its vision builds on the work that has been done by the Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, an interagency partnership between HUD, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and Treasury, since 2009. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:<br>- Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.<br>- People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families.<br>- Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.<br>Joanna Deming, Executive Director of Fineview Citizens Council said, “We are looking forward to working with Allegheny Dwellings Tenants Council, residents and other key partners to re-imagine our communities in a truly inclusive way, prioritizing the retention of long-term residents and providing support before displacement can occur. We’re thankful that HACP, the City of Pittsburgh, Buhl and HUD share that vision, and we’re ready to get to work.”<br>Regarding the collaborations that made this possible, President of the Buhl Foundation Diana Bucco stated, “This significant moment moves us closer to ensuring that all residents of the Northside will have access to quality, affordable housing. A partnership that includes our Mayor’s Office, the Housing Authority, Fineview and surrounding neighborhoods exemplifies what is possible when government agencies work alongside residents to make communities better. This is a huge win for our communities, and will place residents at the center of a significant investment into their neighborhoods that focuses not only on housing, but the issues of education, employment, health and safety that are core to our One Northside Initiative.” <br>Through the Choice Neighborhoods planning process, local governments, housing authorities, residents, nonprofits, tribal authorities, private developers, school districts, police departments, and other civic organizations create a common vision and develop effective strategies to revitalize their neighborhood. The resulting Transformation Plan and locally-driven Action Activities lay the foundation for revitalizing the distressed public and/or assisted housing units, transforming the surrounding neighborhood, and promoting opportunities for families.<br>**_Contact:_** For more information, contact Michelle Sandidge, Chief Community Affairs Officer, at michelle.sandidge@hacp.org or 412-456-5058 | 16/12/2020 15:57:57 |

| Department of Innovation and Performance Calls for IT Professional Services | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 17, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Innovation (I&P) and Performance and Office of Management and Budget Procurement Division have issued an Invitation to Qualify (ITQ) for information technology (IT) professional services that will be required by I&P.  <br>The ITQ provides a comprehensive list of wide-ranging services that I&P anticipates needing in 2021 including training, process automation, financial management, telecom services and cloud architecture support. Vendors and firms are invited to submit proposals to be qualified and added to a list of pre-selected vendors. Once qualified and pre-selected, I&P can call on those vendors to provide their services when needed.   <br>I&P delivers the city’s internal IT services and its mission is to deliver strategic technology services and support to all city departments, foster technology innovation in city government and the broader community, and facilitate efficient and effective city services by supporting data-driven decision making and continuous process improvement. <br>The ITQ is now available on the City’s online procurement portal, [Beacon](https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html), and will be open for submissions from December 17, 2020 – January 28, 2021.

| Mayor William Peduto Provides Support for Federal Ghost Gun Regulation | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 17, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh has joined 10 other cities nationwide to call for the need for the federal government’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to regulate “ghost guns”. The 11 cities have signed on to an amicus brief in support of ongoing litigation seeking for the ATF to appropriately regulate ghost guns under federal law.  <br>Ghost guns are unfinished frames and receivers that are available for purchase, sometimes in kits, that can easily be transformed into fully operational firearms. Since they are not assembled as guns at the time of sale, they are not currently subject to the same regulatory firearm requirements like having a serial number and required background checks for prospective owners.  <br>Cities around the country have seen an increase in the use of ghost guns in preventable gun crimes and violence. Ghost gun sales provide a loophole for individuals who, by federal standards, are not permitted to own firearms since purchasers are not required to complete a background check. They also present barriers to public safety investigations and prosecutions.  <br>“The cities lending their support for this litigation are not asking for anything unreasonable. Firearms regulations should be applied to all guns, including ghost guns,” said Mayor William Peduto. “It’s unfair to those who comply with regulations- regulations that exist to protect the safety of our communities. We just ask that the ATF apply these rules to all gun sales.” <br>Pittsburgh was joined in their support by Columbus, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Durham, North Carolina; Hartford, Connecticut; Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; Paterson, New Jersey; Providence, Rhode Island; Rochester, New York; and Seattle, Washington. | 17/12/2020 14:04:23 |
| Update on Ongoing Snow Removal and Public Works Operations | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 17, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works is continuing to treat and clear roads throughout the city in response to the nearly 10 inches of snow that fell over the past day, which has been registered as the fifth largest December snowfall event in Pittsburgh’s recorded history.  <br>Public Works crews have been working continuously around the clock starting with pre-treatment of the roads on Wednesday morning, working throughout the storm, then continuing removal efforts into today and tonight despite having 25 employees off due to COVID-related reasons.  <br>Additional Public Works personnel have been brought in to assist with snow removal and applying deicing materials for bridges, sidewalks and steps.  <br>Snow Plow tracker is activated and available [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/weather/snow-plow-tracker). Approximately 14 trucks experienced interruptions in data reporting and were not visible on the tracker. The City is working with the software provider to resolve this.  <br>Some neighborhoods are experiencing recycling collections delays due to staffing issues in the Environmental Services division. Residents of the California-Kirkbride, Perry North/Observatory Hill, Perry Hilltop, Arlington, Mount Oliver and South Side Slopes neighborhoods are asked to leave their recycling at the curb as crews will be working extended shifts to collect them through the remainder of the week. Residents are reminded to ensure their refuse and recycling is free of snow for collection. <br>Crews will continue to address snow removal and additional snowfall is anticipated this afternoon. Out of an abundance of safety, residents are asked to only use the roads when necessary and avoid cleaning cars and sidewalks into the street. | 17/12/2020 12:58:31 |

| Pittsburgh Receives First Place Award in U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Awards | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 18, 2020) Mayor William Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh were awarded first place for the U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM) 14th Annual Climate Protection Awards, in partnership with Walmart. The award program demonstrates how cities of all sizes are dealing with the effects of climate change and the impact mayors are having on protecting the environment for future generations.  <br>Pittsburgh was awarded the top prize amongst large cities (populations of 100,000+) for its leadership with the Western Pennsylvania Energy Consortium (WPEC). Started by the City in 2008, WPEC is an innovative electricity purchasing platform that helps reduce costs for members by aggregating electricity load from members’ annual consumption. Earlier this year, the City [announced WPEC’s partnership with Direct Energy](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/3893) to utilize 100% locally sourced renewable electricity for all major city facilities.  <br>WPEC has 32 members that includes some of Pittsburgh’s largest authorities and institutions. Through their joint efforts and purchasing, WPEC has offset nearly 43,000 metric tons of CO2eq and is expected to save members $700,000 in energy costs this year.  <br>“The really exciting part of the Western Pennsylvania Energy Consortium is that it has brought together a critical mass of energy users to reshape our region’s energy future,” said Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto. “This broad partnership saves money for our taxpayers, creates local clean energy jobs and reduces our carbon use, today and into the future.” <br>As part of the recognition, the Walmart Foundation will be granting $25,000 to ONEPGH for WPEC and energy-related investment.  <br>“We commend these mayors and all of the awardees for sustaining their climate efforts and commitments during this most challenging year,” said Amy Hill, Senior Director for Walmart. “Amidst this pandemic and all of its disruption and varied impacts, the successful efforts of these mayors are even more impressive given the many challenges before their cities, including climate protection.” <br>“President-elect Biden has rightly pledged to make climate protection a top priority of his new Administration, and mayors stand ready to join with him to meet the climate challenges before all of us,” said Tom Cochran, USCM CEO and Executive Director. “Mayors have a record of success in taking climate action at the local level and have urged greater federal engagement and commitments on climate protection to bolster and expand upon what mayors are already doing.” <br>Pittsburgh is joined in the large city division with honorable mentions awarded to Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Rochester (MN) Mayor Kim Norton and Tucson Mayor Regina Romero. West Hartford, Connecticut won the top award for small cities.  <br>Full descriptions of the 2020 Mayors’ Climate Protection Award winning programs can be found [here](https://www.usmayors.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-Mayors-Climate-Protection-Awards-Report.pdf). | 18/12/2020 12:50:36 |
| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Congressional COVID Relief Package | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 21, 2020) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement regarding the latest federal COVID-19 relief package:<br>"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected us all on every level – as individuals, as communities, as cities, as states and as a country. All of us are looking to Congress for relief and assistance.  I, and mayors around the country, am profoundly disappointed that direct financial assistance for cities was removed from the latest COVID relief package. With the exclusion of cities from this stimulus package, our first responders and frontline essential workers who have worked tirelessly during this pandemic to protect our communities will be hurt the most. What this country needs is a comprehensive recovery bill like the Heroes Act that the House Democrats passed six months ago.   <br>With expirations on direct protections for Americans looming, I am grateful for the relief that the package does deliver, including unemployment compensation protections, rental assistance programs, critical support for restaurants and small businesses and relief for music and entertainment venues. I am grateful that there is some relief for families, but those of us working directly with these families know that $600 is not enough to relieve struggling families of the devastating effects the pandemic has had on their livelihood.     <br>Our local and national economies cannot recover or survive without real relief. Our communities cannot flourish with businesses shuttering. Economists have made it clear that a comprehensive stimulus will poise our economy for recovery, and it will save lives and our communities. I am confident that the new Congress and administration will revisit the commitment to direct relief for cities and pass an additional stimulus package that fully meets the needs of our country." | 21/12/2020 21:06:43 |
| City Partners with Cultural Humility & Equity Collaborative for Public Safety Cultural Competency Training | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 21, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh and Mayor William Peduto’s Office of Equity have partnered with Cultural Humility & Equity Collaborative, LLC (CHEC) to create a cultural competency training curriculum for the Department of Public Safety bureaus.  <br>The City [released a request for proposals](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4141) for the development of a cultural competency training in July to produce a “Train the Trainer” model curriculum specific to the Pittsburgh region designed in collaboration with public safety personnel and local immigrant and refugee community stakeholders. The selected vendor, CHEC, is a local consulting group made up or organizations that work and have built trust with the immigrant and refugee population and community leaders in the Pittsburgh area. This will allow for a curriculum developed specifically for local first responders designed to meet the needs of our local immigrant and refugee communities with their direct input.  <br>The cultural competency training curriculum will be managed by Welcoming Pittsburgh and the Department of Public Safety Multicultural Liaison Unit (MLU). Once developed, it will be delivered to all personnel in the Police, Fire and EMS bureaus to equip first responders with the knowledge and skills to effectively address and support the public safety needs of Pittsburgh residents with various cultural backgrounds and English language proficiencies. The goal is for all first responders to have the skillset and resources required to appropriately understand, respect, interact, protect and respond to our immigrant and refugee communities.  <br>The training will include multicultural overviews of the immigrant and refugee populations and communities in each of the six police zones to increase officers’ understanding and appropriate cultural response when responding to members of these communities. It will include basic cultural awareness information about the communities being served, the history of those communities and how those factors play a role in the circumstances, attitudes and beliefs of those cultures. The program will include methods of capturing and reporting community input to inform processes for accountability and updating so that trainings remain relevant over time and adapt to the changing needs of our communities.  <br>CHEC and the City will begin to develop the training in early 2021. | 21/12/2020 10:01:57 |

| City of Bridges Awarded $750,000 Grant for Community Affordable Housing Development in Polish Hill | PITTSBURGH, PA – The [City of Bridges Community Land Trust (CBCLT)](https://cityofbridgesclt.org/) has been awarded $750,000 from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh’s (FHLB) Affordable Housing Program (AHP) for the construction of 4 new, permanently affordable, owner-occupied homes in Polish Hill. These 4 units are part of a total of 8 new homes that will be built at the key neighborhood intersection of Dobson and Brereton Streets. CBCLT partnered with First Commonwealth Bank on this successful funding application.<br>Since 2015, the median sales price of homes in Polish Hill has more than tripled and now stands at almost $240,000; a price entirely out of reach for most residents. After more than a decade of organizing, the community of Polish Hill coalesced around the idea of permanently affordable home-ownership at this critical location.<br>“I’d like to congratulate CBCLT and PHCA for receiving this great honor and thank them for their work on this project,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Not only are they creating a legacy of affordable housing for the Polish Hill neighborhood, but working with us and our partners at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Pittsburgh Housing Development Corporation (PHDC), they are exemplifying a standard of how community, nonprofit and government agency partners can collaborate to help realize the vision of a neighborhood.”<br>First Commonwealth Bank, CBCLT’s lending partner on this project, was quick to recognize the value of this project to the Polish Hill community. Evan Zuverink, Vice President & Community Reinvestment Act Officer at First Commonwealth Bank added “We’re incredibly proud to partner with City of Bridges Community Land Trust on the very critical work of creating permanently affordable housing throughout Pittsburgh. City of Bridges' model ensures Pittsburghers of all incomes can continue to reside in the neighborhoods they call home."<br>Many of the previous structures at this site were destroyed by arson in 2007. Since that time the Polish Hill community has been working to see this site rebuilt with a community-serving development. Polish Hill Civic Association (PHCA) Board President, Lizzie Anderson, said, “We’re thrilled! Today, when so many folks are facing such hard times, we welcome this major step towards the PHCA’s goal of maintaining affordability in a neighborhood with a long history of being a place where families of any income level could find a home. As the saying goes, ‘Success has many mothers,’ and this is the culmination of over a decade of advocacy from numerous community volunteers, as well as the vital support of and partnership with the people at the URA, PHDC and the City of Bridges CLT.”<br>This project was able to secure FHLB funds in part due to the donation of the land by the PHDC, a nonprofit subsidiary of the URA, with assistance from the City of Pittsburgh. URA Deputy Executive Director, Diamonte Walker offered her congratulations to CBCLT saying “I want to congratulate City of Bridges on this exciting and well-deserved funding award. I'd also like to thank Rich Snipe, PHDC deputy executive director and his team for their role in helping to make this grant a reality and commend them on the outstanding work they are doing throughout the city to make homeownership accessible to more Pittsburghers.”<br>As an organization that is not yet two years old, this is the first AHP award that CBCLT has received. “This funding is the final piece of the puzzle to unlocking this key development for Polish Hill,” CBCLT Executive Director Ed Nusser said. “The neighborhood has worked for a community-centered development at this site for more than a decade and we are proud to help activate their vision.

| DOMI Awarded $100,000 Grant to Implement Curbside Parking Pilot | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 22, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) has been awarded a grant valued at $100,000 for technical assistance from Automotus, a technology company focused on mobility equity solutions, to analyze, design and implement a strategy to improve curbside efficiency for short-term parking to help restaurants and small businesses.  <br>In response to the pandemic, DOMI has been working with restaurants, small businesses and other community and business stakeholders to design strategies for the creative and operational use of sidewalks, on-street parking areas and streets to help businesses adapt to public health best practices while continuing to operate. As more businesses are offering curbside and takeout services, and with the widespread use of gig delivery services, small business and community stakeholders have expressed the need to develop a more efficient parking system for curbside and delivery services.<br>As part of the technical assistance grant, DOMI will work with Automotus to pilot short-term parking zones that would operate similar to loading zones with time limits that will help local restaurants and couriers ensure a speedy transaction.  The zones will allow those picking up takeout to legally park near businesses, pick up their takeout and be on their way, which will also provide faster, consistent customer turnover for businesses.  <br>Automotus offers technology that uses license plate reading cameras mounted on nearby poles to track in real time whenever a vehicle occupies a pilot zone. Vehicles parked in the zones will be charged by the minute, rather than being required to pay for larger time increments while they go to pick up the takeout. DOMI will be working directly with delivery companies, whom they anticipate will be the most common user.  <br>DOMI hopes to launch the pilot zones in mid-2021 with direct input and consultation from stakeholders including the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, restaurant owners and food delivery companies to determine zone locations, rates and billing mechanisms.  <br>As part of the technical assistance grant, DOMI has requested assistance in the following areas to plan the pilot:  <br>- Comprehensive Curbside Analytics <br>- Monetization of All Commercial Curb Activity <br>- Providing Commercial Drivers with Real-Time Availability Data <br>- More Efficiently Enforcing Parking Violations  <br>DOMI plans to pilot the zones for most of 2021 with the possibility of iterating and adapting based on community feedback and needs. | 22/12/2020 09:32:52 |

| GAP to the Point Bicycle Connection Recognized Nationally | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 22, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh’s new Great Allegheny Passage (GAP) to the Point bicycle facilities project has been recognized nationally by [PeopleForBikes](https://pfb.sparkinfluence.net/) as third on their top 10 list of “ [America’s Best New Bikeways of 2020](https://pfb.sparkinfluence.net/blog/americas-best-new-bikeways-2020/).” <br>Planned in partnership between the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), BikePGH, Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership and other community stakeholders, [the project was completed and unveiled in October](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4413) as a key connector in the Downtown bicycle network. The GAP to the Point facility offers multimodal street upgrades and a dedicated two-way bicycle track connecting Third Avenue to run on Stanwix Street to Penn and Liberty Avenues to the intersection of Commonwealth Place at Point State Park. <br>Not only does this project complete a break in the Downtown bicycle network used by bicycle commuters to access employment centers in the central business district, it also provides a protected connection between the nationally-recognized cycling destinations at Point State Park and the GAP that are visited and used by thousands of bicyclists every year. <br>“We are honored that our GAP to the Point project has been rated as the third top new bikeway in the country for 2020,” said Mayor William Peduto. “This project has provided a critical connection in creating complete streets Downtown and throughout the city where people can feel safe no matter what transportation they use – traveling on the sidewalk, on busses, on bicycles or in vehicles. We hope this safety improvement will bring even more visitors to the GAP and Point State Park, who can now safely explore all that our Downtown has to offer.” <br>PeopleForBikes is a national non-profit that focuses on making every bike ride safer, easier to access and more fun. Their foundation provides financial and technical support to make bicycling better. | 22/12/2020 13:58:40 |
| City Announces Christmas Tree Recycling Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 23, 2020) The City of Pittsburgh announced the opening of five drop-off locations for live trees from December 26, 2020 to January 26, 2021 for its Christmas Tree Recycling program this winter.  <br>The program empowers residents to drop off their trees to be recycled rather than sent to a landfill, which happens when they are placed at the curb. The trees collected will be chipped into pine mulch and made available to the public for free this spring. <br>Last year, the city hosted twelve drop-off sites and collected more than 109 tons of trees.This year, the Department of Public Works' Forestry Division and Bureau of Environmental Services will again collaborate to offer this service at five locations. The reduction in drop-off locations this year is correlated to the city's ability to staff multiple locations during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>The tree recycling program dovetails with the city’s [Climate Action Plan 3.0](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7101_Pittsburgh_Climate_Action_Plan_3.0.pdf), which defines milestones for keeping materials out of landfills to meet [zero waste](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/zero-waste) goals.  <br>The City Channel Pittsburgh has created a brief [public service announcement](https://youtu.be/PMuGoJM8KlE) to remind residents that all ornaments, netting, tinsel and tree stands must be removed before the tree is dropped off.  <br>For more information, residents can call 311 or [visit the program’s website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/xmas-tree-recycling), which includes a map to help residents locate their nearest drop-off location.  <br>2020-2021 Christmas Tree Recycling Drop-Off Locations:   <br>**Hazelwood - 3rd Division of Public Works**<br>Open Year Round  <br>Location: 40 Melanchton St Pittsburgh, PA 15207  <br>Hours: Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.  <br>(412) 422-6524  <br>**Homewood North - 2nd Division of Public Works**<br>Open Year Round   <br>6814 Hamilton Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15208 (North Dallas Ave. at Hamilton Ave.)  <br>Hours: Monday through Saturday, 8:00 a.m to 2:00 p.m.  <br>(412) 665-3609  <br>**Perry North/Observatory Hill - 1st Division of Public Works**<br>Open Year Round  <br>300 Kilbuck Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15214 <br>Hours Monday through Friday , 8:00 a.m to 1:00 p.m. <br>(412) 323-7209 <br>**West End - 5th Division of Public Works**<br>Open Year Round   <br>1330 Hassler St. Pittsburgh, PA 15220  (Off Herschel St. & Steuben St. near Herschel Park)   <br>Monday through Saturday, 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  <br>(412) 937-3054 <br>**Highland Park Zoo Lay Down Area**<br>From December 26, 2020  to January 26, 2021 <br>7370 Baker Street <br>Pittsburgh, PA 15206 <br>Seven days a week, from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. <br>(enter zoo parking lot from Baker Street, follow the signs to back of lot) <br>Map of 2020-21 drop-off locations is also available on the [program's website.](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/xmas-tree-recycling)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/12515_xmas_recycling_map.png) | 23/12/2020 09:53:54 |

PITTSBURGH, PA (December 23, 2020) – The University of Pittsburgh and the City of Pittsburgh are reopening a reimagined Bigelow Boulevard between Fifth and Forbes avenues – a key connection in Oakland – tomorrow, December 24, 2020.

Pitt partnered with the City of Pittsburgh, who owns Bigelow Boulevard, to align much-needed infrastructure work with the city’s [complete streets policy](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5307_Attachment_Exhibit_A_2016-0935__1_.pdf) to coordinate a single project for the block that enhances pedestrian safety and accommodates all modes of transportation more safely and efficiently.

The project provides a new streetscape with safe, separated paths for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, updated utility infrastructure, additional landscaping and more for the Pitt campus and community.

“I’d like to thank the University of Pittsburgh, Chancellor Gallagher and the Oakland community for developing and implementing an improvement plan that creates a safer experience for the thousands of people who use this block of Bigelow – students, commuters, neighbors and people who work in Oakland,” said Mayor William Peduto.

“I am grateful to Mayor Bill Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh for their continued partnership,” said University of Pittsburgh Chancellor Patrick Gallagher. “The new-and-improved Bigelow Boulevard is safer, more accessible, and set to enhance how University of Pittsburgh students, neighbors and visitors will experience Oakland for decades to come.”

Project highlights:

- **Safety and Traffic Flow** – The new streetscape design provides a better, safer experience through a comprehensive multimodal-mobility plan, providing expanded sidewalks and crosswalk lanes, relocating and enhancing the mid-block pedestrian crosswalk, calming traffic, improving the bus stop area and upgrading an important bike connection using best practices in street design to foster a stronger sense of place for Oakland and the University.
- **Accessibility** – Accessibility between the William Pitt Union and recently renovated Schenley Quadrangle is significantly improved.
- **Infrastructure** – Utility infrastructure updates to water lines, chilled water supply, and power distribution enable and support the campus master plan and benefit the community, in addition to creating the resiliency and redundancy needed to support a preeminent research University.
- **Connectivity** – The overall design creates a new welcoming and appealing pathway to Schenley Plaza, the Oakland business district and the Oakland community, as well as providing a flexible new space for student activities and programming outside the William Pitt Union.
- **Sustainability** – From new green spaces and energy efficiencies to a system that will manage rainfall through sustainable landscaping practices, this important renovation project supports Pitt’s commitment to sustainability.

The Bigelow block plan was developed in collaboration with the Oakland Business Improvement District, Oakland Transportation Management Association, Oakland Planning and Development Corporation and part of the Pittsburgh Campus Master Plan process.

Pitt trustees [approved the project plan](http://www.news.pitt.edu/news/pitt-property-and-facilities-committee-approves-bigelow-blvdwilliam-pitt-union-update) in June 2019. Construction began in November 2019 and was initially slated to be completed in August 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed completion of the project. Contractors and partners included Mascaro Construction Company and Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority.

The total cost of the project, including utility upgrades, streetscaping, landscaping and work on the William Pitt Union’s grounds, was $23.7 million. The project was funded by the University of Pittsburgh general budget and a $1 million grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development with support from Senator Jay Costa, Representative Frank Dermody and Representative Dan Frankel.

Bigelow Boulevard is located in the heart of Pitt’s urban campus between the William Pitt Union and Cathedral of Learning buildings, with renovations that provide a welcoming and appealing new pathway connecting the campus, Schenley Plaza, the Oakland business district and Oakland community.
