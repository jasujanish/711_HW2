**The Zone Three Public Safety Council** was formed in the late 1970’s as the Zone 3 Police - Citizen’s Council with the mission “to serve as a vehicle for the exchange of ideas, information and advice so communities may work together for solutions to problems of mutual concern; and to develop more effective and efficient communication community and the Bureau of Police. “

Today, with a new name, we continue serve as a bridge between residents and public safety personnel. Working together keeps us that when we work together, we are Safer Together.

We host open, general meetings monthly. Meetings are both informational and solutions oriented.

- Guest speakers address a topic of interest to Zone 3 residents
- Zone 3 police, elected officials, and department of public safety representatives attend to assist in resolving issues.
- Neighbors share their experiences and news about their communities.
- Residents leave meetings with a sense of the services available as well as what next steps are to be taken to resolve the issue.

We support the development of neighborhood public safety groups and activities (i.e. block watches) believing that each community, neighborhood, block or groups of blocks has the responsibility to identify and help maintain quality of life and public safety concerns.

Each year we select a primary project that will benefit all communities in Zone 3, that can be completed with the year, and that is sustainable over time.
