# Best Food at PNC Park

​Spending the day watching baseball at PNC Park is a real treat.

Speaking of treats...eating at [PNC Park](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/pittsburgh-pirates-at-pnc-park/) is a [culinary adventure](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pnc-park-food-map/)! It's part of the whole [ballgame experience](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/things-to-do/pittsburgh-sports-teams/pittsburgh-pirates/).

Here are some suggestions that go beyond peanuts and cracker jacks, AND check out some of our favorite ballgame traditions [here](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/my-top-10-favorite-things-to-do-on-game-day/).

## NEW FOR 2025

## CANNONBALL!!

One of the hottest new items coming to PNC Park this baseball season are the **Polish Cannonballs** ( _Section 146, Cannonball Stand_). Think of an eggroll but in fried ball form, and you've got this concoction of delicious. Filled with egg noodles, kielbasa, bacon, sauteed cabbage, cheddar cheese, and herb crema, this new menu item is truly stuffed to the brim with Polish goodness. The outside is crispy and offers a delightful contrast with the interior contents. The kielbasa is smoked perfectly and the battle of flavors will make each bite taste different.

## A New Burger in the 'Burgh + More New Items

PNC Park took last year's Renegade Dog and essentially transformed it into a burger. Introducing the **Chili Crunch Smashburger** ( _Section 146, Cannonball Stand_, two potato buns stacked high with an all beef patty, caramelized onion, American cheese, pickles, salt and vinegar chips and a chili crunch aioli in between. The chips really gives this burger the crunch its name promises, with the flavor countering the chili aioli so it's not too spicy.

If burgers aren't your thing, the new **Hot Honey Chicken Croissant** ( _Section 144_) might be up your alley, complete with pub cheese, bacon, and pickles. The sauce is absolutely delicious. There's also the **Kielbasa Cheesesteak** ( _Section 146, Cannonball Stand_), which has caramelized onion, kielbasa, and provolone sauce on an Italian hoagie. Coming from someone who is Polish, the kielbasa was fantastic and paired well with the sauce. Another classic Pittsburgh food item can be found in the **Chipped Ham Empanada** ( _Section 146, Cannonball Stand_), alongside pickles, cheddar cheese, and a hot honey BBQ sauce that's tanginess will surprise you. I heard someone say the empanada reminded them of their childhood, and I'm inclined to agree.

Those who want something more vegan and vegetarian friendly, head to _Homeplate Market_ for some **Beyond Chicken Tender**, a plant-based protein that comes with honey mustard and vegan ranch.

## What About Dessert?

After last year's dessert pierogi took the cake as one of the best new food items at PNC Park, this year's dessert option had some big shoes to fill. Oh boy, did it deliver. The **Fried Almond Torte** ( _Section 146, Cannonball Stand_) is my personal favorite of the new menu items for 2025. A funnel cake batter topped with raspberry sauce, icing, and burnt almonds, the chef said you can't have too many of these because of how sugary it is. I, however, will be testing him on that when I go to my next game because of how delicious these were.

## PNC PARK FAVORITES

## Manny's BBQ

**Left Field**

This newly remodeled barbecue stand is named after former Pirates catcher [Manny Sanguillen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Sanguill%C3%A9n "Link to Manny Sanguillen's Wikipedia page"), who has been known to hang around and sign autographs for fans. Eagle-eyed snack connoisseurs will note the new addition of the topped Mrs. T's mini pierogis you can get with either BBQ pork or chicken _On the menu_: house smoked BBQ pork and chicken, mac n cheese, topped mini pierogis, slaw

## Chicken on the Hill & Cannonball Burger

**Right Field**

Two local Pittsburgh restaurants ( [Coop De Ville](http://coopdevillepgh.com/) and [Station](http://www.station4744.com/)) helped inspire the menus at these spots, and both are located right near seats and tables along the outfield wall to sit and enjoy your meal. _On the menu_: Nashville hot chicken sandwich, double ranch burgers, big mozz cheese sticks, plant burgers

## Pop's Plaza

**Section 132**

Be sure to take advantage of all the new improvements in this section of the ballpark. The tech here allows you to get everything delicious here in one place, with kiosks to order from one central location and get your crab fries, ballpark burgers and more. _On the menu_: Chickie's & Pete's Crabfries (get extra cheese, dipping these things gets addictive), burgers

## Primanti Bros.

**Section 108**

You can't go wrong with a **[Primanti](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/primanti-bros/)**'s sandwich piled high with fresh deli meats and cheeses and topped off with French fries and cole slaw. A true Pittsburgh classic. Just around the corner from this booth is Wings & Things by Caliente, another regional favorite selling buckets of fresh wings and boneless wings. _First-timers read this_: The Pitts-Burger is the go-to order here, which will be a ground beef patty, coleslaw and fries all piled on freshly-baked white bread.

## Fat Head's Bullpen Bar

**Center Field**

It's easy to find good beer throughout the park (North Country's Fireman's Red is my go-to during game day), but the Bullpen Bar specifically features the flavors brewed right here in the city including rotating favorites from Threadbare, Cinderlands, Aslin and other top-notch pours.

## The Market

**Section 118 (Home Plate)**

Try something on the healthier side at this grab-and-go space. The quinoa salad is a filling and delicious alternative to hot dogs and loaded with peppers, tomatoes and a balsamic dressing.

_On the menu_: Grab-n-go salads, vegan bruschetta wrap

## Deli Dogs & Nachoritas

**Sections 135 and 137**

For me, hot dogs are the quintessential ballpark food. Find the best in the park as you head to the bottom of the rotunda in left field and head towards center field. _On the menu_: chili, classic and Chicago-style dogs inspired by local [Smallman Street Deli](http://www.smallmanstreetdeli.com/)

## Sweet Spot

**Behind Section 106**

Treat yourself to a helmet cookie sundae, served just as it says with a fresh baked cookie on top of ice cream in a souvenir helmet sundae bowl. No Pittsburgh home is complete without a few of these on hand.

## Caliente Pizza

**Sections 113-114, 123, 313, 304**

Already a fan favorite at other Pittsburgh stadiums, [Caliente Pizza & Draft House](http://worldsbestpizza.com/) is serving up giant slices of Sicilian, pepperoni and cheese pizza to fans at PNC Park. Find them throughout the ballpark at concessions sections in sections 113-114, 123, 313 and 304. Plus, they also now run the Wings & Things stand next to Primantis for your fix of giant buckets of mouthwatering wings.

## Cinderlands Corner Bar

**Bottom of the left field rotunda**

Easily the best kept secret in the park right now, but one I'm happy to share. Head to the bottom of the left field rotunda, keep walking around to the back of the structure and grab the best beer in the park direct from Cinderlands. _Cans Available:_ Raise It, Squish, Lil Cinder Lime, Full Squish

A friendly neighborhood Pittsburgh transplant.
Probably at book club, a local coffee shop or thrift store. Tell your pet I said hi.
