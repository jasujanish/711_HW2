## Preserving and Celebrating Cultural Heritage and History

The arts are embedded in the history and identity of Carnegie Mellon. In the early 20th century, Pittsburgh was the industrial capital of the world. As industry thrived, so did Pittburgh’s cultural assets, like our world-class museums, galleries and symphony orchestra.

From the 1930s to the 1970s, Charles “Teenie” Harris captured Pittsburgh life as one of the principal photographers for The Pittsburgh Courier, once a leading newspaper for Black communities. The Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA) has scanned and cataloged 60,000 of Harris’ images. A collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and Newcastle University faculty paired a portion of Harris’ photographs with the voices of people who lived during this time and created the exhibit, “ [Teenie Harris Photographs: In Their Own Voice](https://carnegieart.org/exhibition/teenie-harris-photographs-in-their-own-voice/)” at the CMOA.

In the Greater Hazelwood neighborhood, Carnegie Mellon’s new [Robotics Innovation Center](https://www.cmu.edu/ric/) will serve as a hub of robotics research and testing. To honor the history of the [Hazelwood Green site](https://hazelwoodgreen.com/), the center will include a permanent public exhibit showcasing the lives and livelihood of the historic area along the Monongahela River, including the Jones & Laughlin Steel Mill and its workers, as well as the history of robotics. It will also serve as a space where the community can engage with world-class roboticists and learn about emerging technologies in robotics and artificial intelligence.

CMU’s [Center for Arts in Society](https://www.cmu.edu/cas/index.html) sponsors community projects that use the arts as a forum for educational and social work focused on Pittsburgh’s underserved populations. These projects are the result of discussions among Center members and collaboration across fields, as well as partnerships with community groups and consultations with local arts and cultural organizations.
