## Overview

As of September 2021 the City of Pittsburgh has partnered with OpenGov and is excited to announce the upcoming November 1 release of our updated and enhanced public facing Solicitation and Contracts portal, [ProcureNow](https://secure.procurenow.com/portal/pittsburghpa), that will offer users a more efficient, easy to navigate, customer friendly tool that will allow interested parties to do the following:

- Register to bid and receive notifications of future opportunities in the e-Procurement Portal by selecting Subscribe to create an account.
- Create a custom vendor profile and choose the categories for which you wish to receive notifications.
- Follow updates to existing solicitations by finding the solicitation and clicking the Follow button. This will allow all interested parties to receive amendments and addenda automatically.
- Submit questions and receive answers for open solicitations directly in the tool.
- Guide vendors through the process of responding electronically to RFPs, bids, etc. to ensure submissions have been accurately completed.
- Ultimately, be your one location for all bid opportunities issued by the City of Pittsburgh.
- Ability to review award results/postings electronically.
