| Mayor's Office & Office of Community Affairs Seeks Snow Angel Volunteers | Pittsburgh, PA (January 4, 2018) Mayor's Office & Office of Community Affairs is calling for volunteers to assist elderly and disabled residents with home snow removal this Winter <br>The Office of Mayor William Peduto and the Office of Community Affairs launched **[Pittsburgh Snow Angels](http://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels/index.html)**- **a city-wide program that pairs elderly or disabled city residents with volunteers to assist with snow removal during winter months.**<br>This year marks year two that the City has assumed full responsibility for this city-wide program. In our first year we easily discovered many issues with pairing volunteers to recipients. We recognized that in order to meet the need, we needed to increase our level of outreach. By partnering with our partners at the County, and reaching out to local non-profits, corporations, faith based institutions, educational institutions, we are hoping to fill the critical gap in volunteers. <br>Conjointly, we realized the need to make it easier for volunteers to signup. Last year volunteers had to fill out handwritten consent forms. This year we have formed a easier process to signup, volunteers can simply call 311 or fill out the application online. Once we have paired you, we will reach out and contact you.  <br>In addition to enhancing the process for recruitment, we are also implementing a text messaging service, which will notify volunteers of inclement weather. The text messaging system will work in conjunction with the Department of Public Works and their system for **[classifying snow levels](http://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels/index.html)**. All volunteers will be notified for snow levels 1 and up.  <br>For residents 60 years and older and those with disabilities seeking help, you can request an application by calling 311 or by visiting **[Snow Angels Program](http://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels)**. The city ensure it will try its best to match volunteers and participants in need. The City wants to add another layer of information and support services to ensure that all residents 60 years old and older and those living with disabilities live active and healthy lives. <br>**Volunteers Sign Up**<br>Interested volunteers can sign up with a 311 operator or by filling out the **[Online Form](http://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels)**. <br>**Resident Sign Up**<br>Residents in need of snow removal assistance should call 311 or **[Request Application](http://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels)**. | 4/1/2018 15:07:58 |

| West Ohio Street Bridge Closure | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 5, 2018) - The West Ohio Street Bridge over the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks within Allegheny Commons West Park in Pittsburgh’s Northside is closed to vehicular traffic. The closure is necessary due to deteriorating condition of the bridge and continued violation of the three ton weight restriction. Bicycle and pedestrian traffic will be permitted to utilize the bridge. Motor vehicles travelling between Western Avenue and Allegheny Common are advised to utilize Brighton Road, North Avenue and Federal Street as the alternate route. <br>West Ohio Street Bridge carries SR 4084 through Allegheny Commons West Park. The closure and detour has been coordinated with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. <br>Local access to Allegheny Commons West Park will remain open between Brighton Road and Ridge Avenue. <br>The bridge is expected to be closed for a period of two years before a new bridge is constructed and opened.   <br>Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure will monitor traffic impacts and operations as a result of the detour and make adjustments as necessary to facilitate operations and maintain community quality of life. <br>Contact: Jeff Skalican, Deputy Director, Department of Mobility & Infrastructure, (412) 255-2373 [jeff.skaclican@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:jeff.skaclican@pittsburghpa.gov) | 5/1/2018 16:42:17 |

| Mayor William Peduto Urges Action On DREAM Act | Pittsburgh, PA (January 8, 2018) **More than ever, the City of Pittsburgh is recommitting itself to supporting and advocating for our residents affected by the president’s announcement to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.** Since the announcement we have signed on to a formal submission, drafted by the City of Montreal and the global city network [Metropolis](https://www.metropolis.org/about-us), which aimed to point out the vital role that local municipalities play in migration, and should therefore have a voice at the table. Also we partnered with the DC Immigration Hub signing on for the Pennsylvania congressional delegation to pass the Dream Act this year. <br>According to New American Economy in the state of Pennsylvania 87.9% of DACA recipients are employed, earning over 223 million in income, and paying over 20 million in state and local taxes. But beyond data, DACA recipients, and residents that are affected by the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) changes, are our friends, our classmates, our neighbors, our colleagues, and are our fellow Yinzers. In 2018 we aim to be more welcoming than ever before, and that goes beyond our local government and our Welcoming Pittsburgh initiatives; but every resident should make it a priority to be more neighborly, to host and or participate in welcoming events, host welcoming dinners, and advocate for those who need it. <br>Being welcoming goes beyond our immigrant and refugee population, but it also means to be intentional in welcoming other residents and every resident that is represented in our city and county. As a city we should set the standard for the country to follow.  As a city we build bridges, and we welcome all our neighbors.  <br>**Here’s how to participate:**<br>1\. Dial 1-888-778-6856 and wait for the “welcome” message. <br>2\. When prompted, enter your zip code <br>3\. Wait for your call to be connected to your Representative or Senator and tell them to pass a clean Dream Act now. <br>**Suggested Script**<br>Hello, my name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I live in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (city and state). As your constituent, I am calling to urge you to pass a clean Dream Act. Every day that Congress fails to act, 122 community members lose their DACA status and are at risk of being deported. Please pass a clean Dream Act. Thank you for your time. | 8/1/2018 14:15:25 |

| City of Pittsburgh Prepares for Possible Weather Event | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 11, 2018) Officials in Mayor William Peduto's administration and the Department of Public Works (DPW) are monitoring weather reports regarding a possible snow and ice event Friday and Saturday, and preparing accordingly. <br>Forecasts are still showing uncertainty about the impacts of the weekend weather event but DPW is preparing its equipment and supplies in order to address whatever transpires, weather it be snow, ice, freezing rain or a combination of all. <br>DPW equipment is being fitted with plows and wheel chains. City supplies of road salt and Liquid Calcium Chloride are at good levels and with extra deliveries being made today and tomorrow. Public Safety emergency vehicles will be fitted with chains if necessary. <br>Residents are advised that they should stay off roads and travel on them only if necessary — especially in the case of freezing rain. If there are fewer vehicles on roads, that allows DPW crews to treat them more effectively and gives Public Safety first responders better access to emergencies. <br>There is a chance freezing rain may begin to fall between 3-6 p.m. Friday. Employers may want to consider letting workers go home before the Friday afternoon rush hour to make travel less treacherous. <br>_**Chief Operations Officer Guy Costa and DPW Director Mike Gable will be available to talk to reporters about weather preparations at 10 a.m., Friday, January 12, on the City-County Building Portico.**_ | 11/1/2018 13:45:12 |

| Clarification on Pizza Milano Incident | CLARIFICATION: THIS INCIDENT WAS AT PIZZA MILANO IN UPTOWN AND NOT MILANO'S PIZZA IN OAKLAND.<br>"This morning I was made aware of the deeply disturbing video from Milano's Pizza. I have worked through the day with Pittsburgh Police leadership and charges have now been quickly brought. I want to thank the community for their assistance in the investigation, and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police for their hard work throughout the day.

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Changes to Winter Weather Response | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 16, 2018) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement today regarding the conditions of streets and changes his administration will make to winter weather procedures:<br>"The City clearly needs to do a much better job addressing snow and ice on streets across Pittsburgh. Our workers did their best, working around the clock for days, but we need to give them and our residents the tools to provide better service and support in the future.<br>My administration will immediately take four actions to address this situation.<br>First, we will invest in more road salt and liquid calcium chloride, and study ways to improve the chemical composition of the ice-fighting materials that the Department of Public Works is placing on roadways. Most streets throughout the city were treated with salt and chemicals this past weekend but due to low temperatures and other factors the materials did not clear streets nearly well enough.<br>Second, we will work with our Department of Innovation and Performance to increase our public presence on nights and weekends and ensure that resident complaints are efficiently received, responded to, and routed to the appropriate City officials.<br>Third, my administration will meet with DPW partners to explore ways to get more drivers onto streets, particularly on weekends, nights and holidays similar to last weekend. Our employees performed at their best the last four days – working back to back 12-hour shifts responding to a nightmare scenario of rain, freezing rain, snow and ice – but we need to find new ways to send more of them onto the streets and provide Pittsburgh residents the services they deserve.<br>Finally, we will issue a request for proposals for a redesign of our snow removal routes to make sure they are being addressed in the smartest, most efficient and most productive manner.” | 16/1/2018 10:06:56 |

| Peduto Administration Announces Plan to Open Public Works 4th Division | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 17, 2018) Mayor William Peduto and members of Pittsburgh City Council have committed to finding a home in the city's southern neighborhoods for the 4th Division of the Department of Public Works.  <br>The division [was closed in October 2017](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1069) after a structural engineering report found its facilities on Bausman Street in Knoxville were unsafe for both workers and machinery. <br>The Peduto administration today agreed with council members from southern and western neighborhoods of the city to find a location for the 4th Division by July of this year. Pending the search for a location no budget has been set for the project, but there is almost $1 million set aside in the city's Capital Budget for 4th Division improvements in prior year funds. <br>"Providing public works services promptly and efficiently to our residents is one of the most important roles the city performs. Having a new 4th Division will help our workers do just that," Mayor Peduto said. <br>"Thank you to Mayor Peduto. This is great news for southern neighborhoods and will help promote core services within the city," Council President Bruce Kraus said. <br>"Closing the 4th Division presented us with unique challenges," said Councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith. "I want to thank the Mayor for recognizing that reopening it will address critical needs for our residents, and they will be very happy with the news." <br>"As one of my first acts in office, I am thrilled to work with my colleagues and the Mayor to bring forth the announcement of the re-building of our 4th Division Public Works facility," Councilman Anthony Coghill said.  <br>"As we saw over this past weekend, having our drivers come from different areas of the city caused drastic delays in service to some of our hilliest neighborhoods in South Pittsburgh. By re-opening this division, the city can assure that the hard working men and women of the 4th Division can provide coverage for our residents' basic needs in District 4. I look forward to working with our communities to find an appropriate site on which to construct the new facility. A special thanks to Chief of Staff Dan Gilman and Councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith for the unwavering support and efforts on behalf of the people of my district." | 17/1/2018 16:17:05 |

| City Planning Seeks Public Input on Riverfront Zoning | Pittsburgh, PA (January 19, 2018) Beginning this weekend Saturday, January 20, 2018, those who own property along Pittsburgh’s 35 miles of riverfront are encouraged to review the Pittsburgh Department of City Planning’s proposed changes to the existing riverfront zoning code and participate in a 30-day public comment period. City Planning will send letters next week to property owners in and adjacent to the riverfront districts notifying them of the opportunity to comment on the zoning updates. <br>The proposed changes were developed over a two-year public process that included a series of community meetings, focus group sessions, stakeholder interviews and public surveys. The updated zoning increases predictability for communities, property and business owners, and developers, and balances the needs of different uses, including residential, commercial, mixed-use and ongoing industrial activities.  <br>“Pittsburgh’s current riverfront zoning doesn’t reflect the full range of ways that Pittsburghers use our riverfronts today.” said City Planning Director Ray Gastil. “The zoning changes are a way to make sure that everyone is better served by being responsive to today’s riverfront businesses, opening up riverfront access to the community, and encouraging smart new development and redevelopment.”  <br>The proposed zoning creates five new zoning districts that recognize and accommodate the varied uses and characteristics of the Pittsburgh’s riverfronts. It also establishes a performance points bonus system that encourages new development to include public benefits such as riverfront trails and amenities, enhanced rainwater management landscaping and increased energy efficiency in exchange for requested additional building height or reductions in the riparian buffer. <br>The 30-day commenting period starts this Saturday, January 20 and ends on Monday, February 19, 2018. The proposed zoning will be the subject of a public hearing before the Pittsburgh City Planning Commission on February 20, 2018 at 2:00 pm. Property owners in the riverfront zoning districts can review the proposed zoning online at [www.pghriverfrontzoning.com/documents-presentations/](http://www.pghriverfrontzoning.com/documents-presentations/) and submit comment via email to City Planning’s project manager Andrea Lavin Kossis at [andrea.lavinkossis@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:andrea.lavinkossis@pittsburghpa.gov). | 19/1/2018 14:14:27 |
| Mayor William Peduto Issues Executive Order Adopting Restructuring Recommendations of PWSA Blue Ribbon Panel | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 22, 2018) Mayor William Peduto today issued an Executive Order adopting recommendations of his Blue Ribbon Panel on restructuring Pittsburgh Water & Sewer Authority governance. <br>After a year of study, the panel [last month issued recommendations](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1311) that the PWSA remain a public asset while having its board of directors named by an independent Board of Nominators, insulating it from political influence. The Mayor's Executive Order adopts that recommendation and empowers the panel to hire legal counsel to prepare a contract between the City and the PWSA regarding the panel's recommendations.<br>The Order calls for the contract to be adopted by March 31 of this year. <br>"\[Because\] the Mayor understands that it is important to make long-overdue changes in the way The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is governed and invest in our water and sewer infrastructure, he appointed the Blue Ribbon Panel in March of 2017 to advise the City on the selection of a consultant to provide an independent review of the current state of PWSA and recommendations for improvement," the Order reads in part.  <br>"\[While\] the Blue Ribbon Panel report stated that PWSA has made significant progress in recent months, PWSA, working with its new Board of Directors, must continue to pursue aggressively its transformation into a high-functioning, customer-oriented organization and its plan to repair and replace the existing water supply infrastructure." <br>The full Order [is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/1513_01-22-18-Blue-Ribbon-Panel-EO-Release.pdf). | 22/1/2018 11:03:08 |

| Statement by Bureau of Neighborhood Empowerment on Black History Month | As we look ahead to Black History month one must reflect on why we as a nation observe the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. The observance of such a man challenges us to live a life of personal reflection and examine the role that we individually play in making our neighborhoods, communities, and this City an equitable place to live, work, play, and do business.   <br>We live in a country that has far too often forgotten what it was founded upon; and we as a city will endeavor to remember the sacrifices, the persecutions, and the victories that has brought us this far. We must understand that our growth is determinant on each resident investing in building our knowledge of those that have helped build this country and those that have helped build this city. The City of Pittsburgh has been selected to participate in the inaugural Cities for Racial Equity and Racial Healing Technical Assistance Initiative. This initiative will help us to advance strategies and build the internal infrastructure for racial equity.   <br>In 2014 the Bureau of Neighborhood Empowerment (BNE) was formed as a key bureau within the Mayor’s Office to build our city’s low and moderate income neighborhoods from the ground up by addressing issues surrounding affordable and mixed income housing, education and youth development, immigrant, veteran, LGBTQIA+ and challenged populations, nonprofit and faith-based community initiatives, small business development, economic opportunity, and equity and inclusion in the City of Pittsburgh.    <br>"It is incumbent upon all governmental officials to not just celebrate Black History Month but, more importunately take real action to ensure equality that is needed for African Americans and all those underserved. Black History Month is an continuous endeavor."said Chief Urban Affairs Officers Valerie McDonald-Roberts.  <br>Coming out of the Obama administration, Michelle Obama gave us all words of wisdom, "when they go low, we go high." These words were to encapsulate the fact that we must not stoop to the level of our aggressor, but we must aim to be greater than our biggest hero. Martin Luther King Jr. is a symbol of just that. Being the best we can be, despite of opposition on almost all fronts. We are still in an age that has a glimpse of darkness, but as Dr. King Jr. said, "darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."    <br>We must remember that the observance of Martin Luther King Jr. was not just another federal holiday, or a day that we celebrated the life and legacy of a man. It was a day that represented years of civil unrest, years of demonstration, and years of pain and suffering on the backs of a group of people. While we understand that this pain has not been completely subdued, it is important that we recognize the pain and the importance of healing in a community that has had to fight tooth and nail to sit at the table. As we enter Black History Month, we will hear, read, and learn stories of men and women who in the past and present demonstrate(d) great courage in a time that did not welcome that courage, and sometimes still doesn’t. It is this same courage that each of us should glean from, to take the first step in addressing our personal biases, and ways we do not advocate for people of color, and for equal opportunities for all. You might ask, "What role can I play?" We must acknowledge that there is still racial division that exists, and think of ways you and your circle of influence can positively impact other members of your community in your work, home, school or business. Take advantage of the great events and opportunities to learn from workshops, speaker series that different organizations, and institutions will be holding during Black History Month and throughout the year. These are just a couple of steps that each resident can take, it will take all of us to make our city an equitable place for all. | 5/2/2018 15:08:18 |

| Gov. Tom Wolf and Mayor William Peduto Lift Pittsburgh from Act 47 Distressed Status | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 12, 2018) Governor Tom Wolf, Mayor William Peduto and Secretary of the Department of Community Development Dennis Davin today signed documents officially taking the City of Pittsburgh out of Act 47 distressed municipality status. <br>The City agreed to Act 47 oversight – which led to controls on spending, increased taxes and adoption of fiscal reforms – in 2004. It renewed that status in 2009 and again in 2014. <br>Today the Governor, Mayor and Secretary signed formal determination letters terminating Pittsburgh's distressed status.  <br>“This turnaround wasn’t easy – it took a lot of hard work, a lot of collaboration, and yes, some constructive arguments about where the city was headed, but in the face of it all, Pittsburgh stood united – desperately working to improve its stability and its financial health,” said Governor Wolf. “Pittsburgh’s recovery has captured the attention of the nation, and, frankly, the world. We’ve transformed a rust belt city that was a symbol of economic decline into one of the most dynamic examples of innovation for the new economy in the world. My administration has been proud to support your efforts and will continue to do so in the years ahead.” <br>With the city facing deep service cuts, layoffs and possible bankruptcy, then-Councilman Peduto was the first member of Pittsburgh city government to call on the city to enter Act 47 protection. In his budget address in November of last year Mayor Peduto announced  that the time was right to finally end the state oversight. <br>"I want to thank city residents and workers for all their patience and sacrifices the past 14 years," Mayor Peduto said. "Act 47 was the tool we needed to bring our financial house in order and pave the way for Pittsburgh's economic resurgence. Now our challenge is to continue building upon the fiscal discipline it taught us and not revert to the poor budget habits of our past." <br>When making his Act 47 announcement in November the Mayor introduced legislation to Council to cement that fiscal discipline by adopting caps on pension enhancements and standards regarding debt service; retiring unspent capital funds; and maintaining a healthy fund balance. <br>In addition to the city workers impacted by Act 47, Mayor Peduto thanked the many officials who worked on the city's recovery from the administrations of Mayors Tom Murphy, Bob O'Connor and Luke Ravenstahl; his Chief Financial Officer Sam Ashbaugh; Office of Management and Budget Director Jennifer Prescuitti; his former Finance Director Paul Leger and current Director Margaret Lanier; City Controller Michael Lamb; City Council Budget Director Bill Urbanic; and the city's longtime Act 47 coordinators at Public Financial Management and Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellot. <br>Mayor Peduto especially thanks the four then-Councilmembers who joined him in approving the first Act 47 plan and having the courage to vote for Pittsburgh's future: Alan Hertzberg, President Gene Ricciardi, Doug Shields and Sala Udin. <br>A copy of the DCED Act 47 Rescission Report and Hearing Report released today [is available here.](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/1715_Pittsburgh_City-Act_47_Hearing_Officer_Report-Departmental_Order-Rescinding_Distress_Designation-2018_Final.docx) | 12/2/2018 09:39:02 |

| Pittsburgh EMS Takes the Lead on Naloxone Leave Behind Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (FEBRUARY 13, 2018) In mid-January, the City of Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Bureau became one of the first in the state to begin operating a naloxone leave behind program. Through the program, city paramedics and EMTs leave naloxone, the opioid antidote, with patients who decline transport to the emergency department.  <br>Naloxone leave behind, which was sanctioned by the statewide disaster emergency declaration on heroin and opioids signed by Gov. Tom Wolf on January 10, represents one component of the City’s evolving strategy to link people who use drugs with supportive services. <br>“We commend Pittsburgh EMS for joining the leave behind program, made possible by Governor Wolf’s emergency declaration,” said Allegheny County Health Director Dr. Karen Hacker. “This is one more action step in our fight to address the opioid overdose epidemic. While naloxone is not treatment, it can save lives and provide opportunities for recovery. We hope more agencies that provide emergency medical services in the county follow suit.” <br>This program was developed within the EMS Bureau and led by Patient Care Coordinator Mark Pinchalk and Chief Robert Farrow. All of Pittsburgh’s first responders, including park rangers, carry the overdose reversal medication. Naloxone kits for this and other Pittsburgh first responder programs are made available through funding from Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency and a program managed by the Allegheny County Health Department.  <br>“The naloxone leave behind program targets the post-overdose patient who declines transport to a hospital and who is at a high risk of overdosing in the future,” said Chief Farrow. “The ability of EMS to leave behind naloxone to the post overdose patient, family member or other responsible party will undoubtedly save lives and build trust and hope in our communities. Pittsburgh EMS will continue to partner with the public health community to positively impact the opioid epidemic for both the short and long term.” <br>"Pittsburgh EMS views the naloxone leave behind program as part of our overall continuum of response to the opioid issue. Naloxone leave behind is a short term harm reduction initiative, which we combine with improved medical  management of opioid overdose by paramedics in the field as part of our Core Critical Care programs, said Pinchalk.<br>According to Mayor’s Office Critical Communities Initiatives Manager Laura Drogowski, "We commend the leadership from EMS and will continue to prioritize naloxone availability in parallel with prevention and resource linkage. We never want Pittsburghs’ first responders to be in a situation where they cannot save a life." | 13/2/2018 11:28:15 |

There is resident access only to the street, which will be closed until further notice. No through-traffic is permitted. <br>In Spring Hill, a landslide on Gershon Street between Luella Street and Sunset Avenue has also forced a closure until further notice. Residents may enter Gershon Street from either end but no through-traffic is permitted. <br>Engineers have been inspecting both streets and are determining courses of action with officials from the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI). <br>Rainfall and shifting temperatures matched with saturated ground conditions have led to landslides and rockslides around the region, which are expected to continue. Teams from the city are ready to respond to the slides, but motorists are advised to use extreme caution when faced with landslides and not attempt to travel around them. <br>Sections of both McArdle Roadway in Mount Washington and Noblestown Road in the West End were closed for portions of the weekend after landslides and rockslides respectively. Crews worked through Friday and Saturday nights to clear the hillside above McArdle, and reopened it at midday Sunday. They worked rapidly on Sunday to clear Noblestown and plan to reopen it by 6 p.m. this evening. <br>"I want to extend my appreciation and that of the whole city to the DPW and DOMI crews who have been working on these cleanup efforts, all the while working on snow and pothole response at the same time," Mayor William Peduto said. "Unfortunately weather forecasts for the next two weeks are not giving us much relief, so I thank residents for their patience while our workers are responding to these matters as quickly as possible." | 18/2/2018 16:31:06 |
| Pittsburgh and Paris Join Transportation and Technology Firms in Mobility Pledge | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 2, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh is a signatory on an international pact among governments, transportation, technology and climate organizations adopting common principals on mobility that promote equity, efficiency and sustainable urban communities. <br>The " [Shared Mobility Principals For Livable Cities"](https://www.sharedmobilityprinciples.org/), to which each signatory committed, lay out 10 collective values that each signatory pledges to abide by:  <br>01. We plan our cities and their mobility together.  <br>02. We prioritize people over vehicles.  <br>03. We support the shared and efficient use of vehicles, lanes, curbs, and land.  <br>04. We engage with stakeholders.  <br>05. We promote equity.  <br>06. We lead the transition towards a zero-emission future and renewable energy.  <br>07. We support fair user fees across all modes.  <br>08. We aim for public benefits via open data.  <br>09. We work towards integration and seamless connectivity.  <br>10. We support that autonomous vehicles in dense urban areas should be operated only in shared fleets.  <br>Technology and transportation firms signing onto the pledge included: BlaBlaCar, Citymapper, Didi, Keolis, LimeBike, Lyft, Mobike, Motivate, Ofo, Ola, Scoot Networks, Transit, Uber, Via and Zipcar.   <br>It was also signed by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability. Pittsburgh is a member of both groups and Mayor Peduto is [on the ICLEI USA board of directors](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1308), and Pittsburgh was among the first cities to sign on to the principles. <br>The Mayor praised the accord in an international conference call Thursday with Paris Deputy Mayor Jean-Louis Missika and leaders from the tech and transportation firms.  <br>"Twenty-first century mobility is more than just getting from point A to point B. It's about facing down social problems and providing opportunity for everyone," Mayor Peduto said.  <br>"We can't make the mistakes of the past, when transportation decisions made life more difficult for people. We have to get ahead of the problems and create transportation solutions that provide an underlying foundation of sustainability and equity in the future."  <br>To advance these principles, last year the Mayor created the new Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) to focus on safe, accessible, sustainable and efficient transportation options for the city.  <br>"Mobility is not an end in itself, it is a fundamental means to access and opportunity leading to social and economic mobility. How we deliver it can make or break communities, environmental quality and quality of place. These shared Principles commit us all to a higher path and shared support," said DOMI Director Karina Ricks. | 2/2/2018 13:16:17 |

| Public Works Crews Working Around the Clock on Potholes During Dry Weather | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 19, 2018) Crews from the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works are working around the clock  – weather permitting – to patch potholes in streets citywide. <br>DPW expects to have crews cold-patching potholes nonstop from 10 p.m. tonight (Monday) through Wednesday afternoon, when rain is forecasted to resume. <br>When there is rain or snow potholes cannot be effectively patched: cold-patch asphalt will become dislodged if placed in a pothole containing precipitation. Periods of rain or snow are currently predicted most days over the following two weeks but crews will be patching whenever possible in dry weather. <br>Pothole season has been especially bad this year following a record-cold January and repeated freeze-and-thaw cycles. In the past six weeks there have been 3,769 pothole requests sent to the city's 311 Response Center as compared to 1,240 requests for the same period in 2017. From October 2017 through February 2018 there have been 5,036 pothole requests versus 2,271 requests in the same period of 2016-2017.<br>Hot-mix asphalt is the best material for patching potholes but it is typically not available until April. <br>Resurfacing streets in warm weather months also helps fight potholes. The City's budgets for street resurfacing have more than doubled since 2014, which has made the streets more resilient, but after years of neglect and under-investment there are still many road surfaces in need of improvement. The City's 2018-2023 Capital Improvement Plan includes $103 million for street resurfacing, with $16 million allocated in 2018. <br>On other weather-related matters city crews, with help from geotechnical engineers, are continuing to study landslides in Mount Washington and Spring Hill [that forced the closure of two streets on Sunday.](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1499) | 19/2/2018 14:32:15 |

The Champion Cities will now begin a 6-month testing phase where they will conduct public prototypes of their ideas with grant funding of up to $100,000 per city, a new addition to the Competition this year. The Mayors Challenge returns to the U.S. as the first investment in the American Cities Initiative, a $200 million suite of new and expanded programs that will empower cities to generate innovation and advance policy that moves the nation forward.<br>Pittsburgh now advances to the six-month “Test, Learn, and Adapt” phase of the competition. Cities will refine their ideas during this process with up to $100,000, as well as personalized support from innovation experts, to test and begin building support for their urban innovations and submit a new application in August 2018. In October, four cities will receive $1 million awards and one will receive a grand prize of $5 million to bring their ideas to life.<br>"We received hundreds of bold and creative ideas from cities around the country in response to the 2018 Mayors Challenge, and these 35 really stood out for their potential to improve people’s lives. The next six months are a great opportunity for the cities to test their ideas and make them even more innovative and effective,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and three-term Mayor of New York City.<br>The 35 Champion Cities performed the best against four key criteria - vision, potential for impact, implementation plan, and potential to spread to other cities. A prestigious selection committee Co-Chaired by Former Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and Former Xerox Chairman & CEO Ursula Burns and comprising distinguished policy experts, artists, academics, business executives and social innovation leaders assessed the applications.<br>An aging and inefficient housing stock has made Pittsburgh the sixth worst in the country for residential energy burden; resulting in its residents spending more than double the national average on utility bills. The city of Pittsburgh is [proposing a solution](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1125) that could increase demand for retrofitting residential properties by reducing costs through group purchasing of materials and the facilitation of DIY product installation. Pittsburgh is one of 35 U.S. cities competing for the grand prize; others include Boston, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.<br>“Urban innovation is the key to pioneering solutions for real-world problems that affect us on a global scale,” Mayor William Peduto said. “That's why I am thrilled to partner with Bloomberg Philanthropies, a champion in the urban innovation space, to help Pittsburgh reach its goal of 100% renewable energy sources by 2035, which has been challenging living in a fossil-fuel rich region like Pennsylvania. This funding gives us an opportunity to explore a new idea that not only empowers citizens to meaningfully engage with the energy consumption conversation, but, also invites them to take action.”<br>The 2018 Mayors Challenge builds on the success of previous Bloomberg-sponsored Challenges in the U.S. (2013), Europe (2014), and Latin America and the Caribbean (2016).

| Statement on Procedures Following Officer-Involved Shootings | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 22, 2018) Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert released the following statement in response to community concerns about the officer-involved shooting that occurred in Homewood on February 11, 2018:<br>"The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police values its long-standing relationships with Pittsburgh residents and understands frustration within the community regarding officer-involved shootings, especially when they result in death.<br>Due to the ongoing investigation being conducted by the Allegheny County Police Department, we are unable to go into specific details. However, our goal is to be as transparent as possible while maintaining the integrity of the investigation and our independence from it.<br>Parallel to the outside investigation, the PBP follows its own internal protocols following critical incidents, which includes officer-involved shootings. Officers are placed on administrative leave, their performance files are reviewed, and they are subject to a psychological evaluation. Based upon the findings of the outside investigative agency and the District Attorney’s office, the Public Safety Director and the Bureau then determine when and if the involved officer will return to active duty.<br>The use of deadly force is always our last resort, but we expect our police officers to actively patrol and to be proactive in order to keep our city safe. Our goal is to reduce the levels of violence and criminal activity impacting our communities.<br>I know there is a lot of speculation surrounding the death of Mr. Mark Daniels, but I ask the community to allow the Allegheny County Police Department to complete a thorough and impartial investigation based upon the facts and evidence in the case." | 22/2/2018 15:31:47 |
| Geotechnical Reports Show Spring Hill and Garfield Homes Impacted by Landslides Remain Unsafe | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 22, 2018) Preliminary geotechnical engineering reports performed for the Department of Permits Licenses and Inspections (PLI) recommend that homes evacuated in Spring Hill and Garfield remain in danger from adjacent landslides and should not be occupied until the landslides and the homes are stabilized. <br>After two separate landslides PLI ordered the evacuation Tuesday [of six homes on Goehring Street and Kenzig Avenue in Spring Hill](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1507) and on Wednesday the evacuation of four homes [on Broad Street in Garfield](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1510). It asked a geotechnical engineering firm to further study the areas and today, in a preliminary report, the engineers agreed that the slopes are unstable and the homes should remain vacated. <br>The department will work with landowners to help them with surveying the slides and designing and executing a safe slope. Exactly how that stabilization work will be performed, or when, will not be known until a full geotechnical study is performed. <br>PLI Director Maura Kennedy is contacting the ten impacted homeowners and updating them on the preliminary geotechnical reports. <br>The Red Cross is also working with the families. <br>Officials in Mayor William Peduto's office are studying the needs of each family with hopes of connecting them to additional services to assist them. <br>The geotechnical reports are preliminary and not being publicly released. | 22/2/2018 16:06:28 |

| Landslides Being Monitored Around City | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 23, 2018) Pittsburgh officials are monitoring four new landslide sites across the city, but as of early Friday afternoon only a street in Spring Hill was forced to close due to the activity. <br>The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) with the assistance of the Department of Public Works (DPW) closed Diana Street at Ives Way in Spring Hill due to a slide that is possibly impacting a retaining wall. <br>Forward Avenue and Commercial Street in Squirrel Hill/Swisshelm Park was closed but reopened. Officials are watching a retaining wall for future activity. <br>Two active slides are on Granger Street in New Homestead. The road is open to homeowners but it is vulnerable and motorists should use caution. <br>There are three active slides on Mooney Road in New Homestead/Lincoln Place. DOMI has hauled away material from the slide and the road remains open, but it is possible the slide could impact Mifflin Road. <br>This release will be updated if more information (including intersections) becomes available. | 23/2/2018 15:41:59 |
| City of Pittsburgh Prepares for Flooding and Other Weather-Related Events | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 23, 2018) Agencies across the City of Pittsburgh are preparing for flooding, street closures and other impacts of heavy rains that are expected through Sunday. <br>Impacts will be greatest around Downtown, low-lying areas, hillsides and riverfronts but residents citywide are urged to be vigilant about weather-related issues, street and highway closures and possible power outages and landslides. Motorists are strongly advised to turn vehicles around if they encounter pooling water on roadways. <br>The Pittsburgh region is expected to receive more than 3 inches of rain this weekend, with the heaviest downpours tonight and late Saturday into Sunday morning. Forecasts are – conservatively – for the 25 foot flood stage Downtown to be reached by Sunday morning and crest at 26 feet by Sunday night. <br>Starting this morning sections of the Penn Avenue bike lane Downtown between 6th and Stanwix streets will be closed. This will allow Pittsburgh Allegheny County Thermal (PACT), which has tunnels vulnerable to flooding, to stage a pump in one of its vaults. If the pump is activated Fort Duquesne Boulevard between 6th and Stanwix streets may be closed along with the same section of Penn Avenue. Other adjacent streets may also be closed depending on the severity of flooding. <br>Motorists should also be aware that flood-prone roadways such as River Avenue in the North Shore, Washington Boulevard, and the "bathtub" section of I-376 Westbound in Downtown could be subject to closures. The 10th Street bypass Downtown is already closed. <br>Residents with basements that regularly flood should be prepared for belongings to become water-damaged and may want to move such materials in advance of the weekend storms. <br>Public Safety, the Department of Public Works (DPW) and the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) are all planning for weather events along with other local, state and federal partners. <br>Public Safety is: <br>- Readying EMS, Fire and Police flood response units and swift water rescue teams <br>  <br>- Preparing pumps and generators <br>  <br>- Preparing to open its Emergency Operations Center, in conjunction with Allegheny County Emergency Services  <br>  <br>DPW is: <br>- Clearing debris from roadway catch basins  <br>  <br>- Acting on standby to help DOMI and other agencies with debris, road closures and fallen trees <br>  <br>- Putting aside barricades in commonly flooded areas such as the North Shore and South Side <br>  <br>DPW addressed 1,265 pothole complaints in a 44-hour period [between Monday night and Wednesday evening](http://pittsburghpa.gov/city-info/press-releases.html). Residents should note that the cold-patch asphalt placed in the potholes will be dislodged during the weekend's heavy rains, forcing DPW crews to address them again during favorable weather. <br>DOMI is primarily responsible for responding to any events that block or damage roadways. It is: <br>- Designating on-call staff to respond to roadway events <br>  <br>- Notifying outside contractors in case assistance is needed <br>  <br>- Monitoring roadways it has evaluated to be most prone to landslides <br>  <br>- Developing alternate routes around closed streets to ensure continued access and mobility to the public <br>  <br>Landslides developed around the city this week that [forced roadway closures](http://pittsburghpa.gov/city-info/press-releases.html) and the [evacuation of homes](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1516) by the Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections. With soil around the region saturated by record levels of rain this month more landslides are a possibility. <br>Public Safety has designated the Fire Bureau to be first responders to reports of landslides, which will then be evaluated by PLI if homes are impacted. <br>Officials in the Mayor's Office are working to develop plans to connect evacuated families with needed services. <br>Residents should call 911 to report any emergency situations such as flooding or landslides and contact 311 regarding potholes and other non-emergency issues. | 23/2/2018 10:37:39 |

| Peduto Administration to Add Nearly $1 Million to 2018 Paving Budget | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 26, 2018) Mayor William Peduto's administration is proposing to add $800,000 to the city's 2018 paving budget, which will increase its street resurfacing by 50 more city blocks. <br>Legislation being introduced to City Council tomorrow would raise the city's street resurfacing budget to nearly $17 million this year. <br>"I'm proud that the City has more than doubled its spending on paving since I took office four years ago, and this extra funding will do even more to provide infrastructure improvements and build roads that are more resistant to potholes," Mayor Peduto said. <br>According to Department of Mobility and Infrastructure Director Karina Ricks, every mile of city streets costs about $260,000 to pave. The new funding will allow about 4 more miles to be repaved or roughly 50 more city blocks. <br>More paving information [is available here.](http://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/paving/index.html)<br>To pay for increased paving the Office of Management and Budget is proposing a combination of capital and operating funds; capital for projects closed or not immediately needed; and unused funds budgeted for phase two of the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority restructuring. | 26/2/2018 08:57:37 |

| EcoInnovation District Focuses on New Approaches for Resilient Neighborhood-Building | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 1, 2018) A plan two years in the making, the EcoInnovation District (EID) Plan establishes a community vision for equitable and sustainable development in one of Pittsburgh’s oldest neighborhoods. The planning process led by the Department of City Planning included monthly community steering committee meetings that helped guide the development of the plan, 70+ interviews and focus groups, block parties and open house events attended by over 600 residents and stakeholders, and a robust online presence that drew over 10,000 visitors.<br>When Mayor Peduto released the draft plan at a community meeting on July 11th, 2017 he made it clear that the plan is the City’s attempt to answer a simple question: “How do we develop a community for all that makes sure that the people who have gone through the bad times will be there for the good times?” An indicator of the plan’s success was the presence of leadership from Uptown Partners, Avenu, Duquesne University and UPMC Mercy who followed the mayor’s comments by expressing their excitement at getting to work making the plan a reality.<br>**The First Adopted Neighborhood Plan**<br>The EcoInnovation District Plan is the first time in many decades that the City has led a community planning process and created a plan that will guide the activities of both community and public partners.<br>“The EcoInnovation District Plan represents not only the vision and hard work of the community and staff, but a collaborative model in how we determine our future,” said Ray Gastil, Director of the Department of City Planning. The final plan adopted by the City’s Planning Commission can be found on the project website, [www.EcoInnovationDistrict.org](http://www.ecoinnovationdistrict.org/) along with news about projects that implement the plan and ways to stay involved. Printed copies of the plan are also available to review at public offices and libraries in Downtown, the Hill District and Oakland.<br>**An Innovative New Land Use System**<br>Through focus groups and community meetings it became clear that land use regulations were limiting development and part of the plan’s vision for a green and equitable neighborhood could be realized if innovative new tools were introduced into the City’s Zoning Code.<br>Planners at the Department of City Planning looked to national best practices and the p4 Collaboration between the City and the Heinz Foundation to craft a new Uptown Public Realm District and Performance Points System.<br>Derek Dauphin, the project manager for the EcoInnovation District Plan and lead author on the zoning proposal explained the City’s strategy: “The neighborhood has always been mixed-use with offices and workshops next to grocers and rowhouses – we aren’t changing that. We’re focusing on how new buildings contribute to the neighborhood’s goals. If a new building is taller than the historic structures in the district, it’s because it’s implementing the community’s plan.”<br>The Performance Points System, created in alignment with the p4 metrics, allows developers to take advantage of height bonuses if they provide affordable housing, build energy efficient structures, generate power renewably, manage stormwater with Green Infrastructure, rehabilitate older buildings, or build new buildings that match the district’s historic character – all goals of the EcoInnovation District Plan. City Council adopted the zoning in November and it was signed into law in December.<br>Through a new development guide website and collaboration with the Green Building Alliance, the Department of City Planning is working hard to make it clear that the new regulations provide many opportunities to those thinking about developing in Uptown. This will include free green building reviews for larger projects in Uptown to provide information about green building and educate developers about the new height bonus opportunities available to them in Uptown.<br>**What Comes Next?**<br>One of the first major projects to take advantage of Uptown’s new zoning will be development on land owned by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the City of Pittsburgh at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Dinwiddie Street. Input from a public design process currently being rolled into a development request for proposals (RFP) that will be issued this year. Implementing the plan is about much more than the creation of new buildings. DCP’s Division of Public Art and Civic Design is finalizing a request for proposals for the first of three public art projects it will carry out over the next two years using public funds. Matching funds are being sought to increase the scale of the second and third projects.<br>In addition to art, over the next year Uptown will see new public art, transportation safety improvements, green infrastructure planning, and other projects that begin to realize the vision in the plan. Leading these efforts is another recommendation from the plan – the Uptown Task Force. This group, convened by Duquesne University, creates a platform for district governance and plan implementation. Subcommittees have already formed around each of the EcoInnovation District’s chapters and are creating work plans to execute the strategies in the plan. Learn more about the Task Force at its website: [www.UptownTaskForce.org](http://www.uptowntaskforce.org/).<br>A key element of the planning work, the proposal for a citywide Bus Rapid Transit system is also moving forward with a funding proposal submitted to the Federal Transportation Authority in September.<br>**Contact:**<br>Derek Dauphin<br>Senior Planner \| Strategic Planning<br>City of Pittsburgh<br>Department of City Planning<br>200 Ross St, 4th Floor<br>Pittsburgh, PA 15219<br>Phone: 412-255-4897<br>Fax: 412-255-2838<br>derek.dauphin@pittsburghpa.gov<br>pittsburghpa.gov/dcp | 1/3/2018 13:01:33 |
| Gender Equity Press Conference | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 1, 2018) With the start of Women’s History Month 2018 the City of Pittsburgh is proud to publicly launch its Gender Equity Commission, one of the few such commissions in the entire country. <br>Mayor William Peduto signed an ordinance last year that authorized the commission to conduct analyses of City departments, employment, and services to uphold the principles of the [Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)\[TM1\].](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/)<br>Beginning last month, the Commission commenced monthly meetings, which are open to the public and held on the third Tuesday of each month. With representation from different expertise areas and lived experiences, this Commission of 15 diverse community stakeholders coordinates with Executive Director anupama jain, who works in Mayor Peduto’s Bureau of Neighborhood Empowerment. <br>According to jain, “Throughout the world, the majority of women. Especially those from marginalized communities and trans women, cannot count on achieving adequate safety and success according to most measures of quality of life. I am honored and privileged to be working with local leaders and visionaries to devise concrete solutions to our city’s challenges regarding equity and inclusion.”   <br>"Shirley Chisolm, one of my favorite female revolutionaries and someone who I try to model, said 'Tremendous amounts of talent are lost to our society just because that talent wears a skirt.'. In 2018, this is still the case, and quite frankly, I'm over it. If I can do anything to push barriers for women, especially as a black woman, then I'm there. That's why I'm serving,” said Commission member Kelauni Cook, founder and CEO of Black Tech Nation. <br>The Commission will be using data analysis and evidence-based interventions to pinpoint patterns of inequity and then work with experts in different areas to devise sustainable and affordable solutions for those problems.  <br>“These are not ‘women’s issues’ but deeply human issues about which all reasonable people care, such as education and work, public and personal safety, diversity of viewpoints for innovation, and support for families,” jain said.  <br>**The Gender Equity Commissioners are:**<br>Megan Block         <br>Attorney, Civil Rights, Union and Employment  <br>Kelauni Cook        <br>Founder and CEO, Black Tech Nation; Co-Director, Beta Builders Coding Boot Camp Community  <br>Kathi Elliott  <br>Executive Director, Gwen's Girls  <br>Lee Fogarty          <br>Leader, Cities for CEDAW Pittsburgh  <br>Deb Gross             <br>Councilperson, City Council, District 7, City of Pittsburgh  <br>Sarah Hansen        <br>Senior Director of Operations, Pennsylvania Women Work  <br>Magdeline Jensen         <br>CEO, Greater Pittsburgh YWCA  <br>Sabrina Korbel     <br>Attorney, Women's Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh  <br>Janet Manuel        <br>Acting Director, Department of Human Resources, City of Pittsburgh  <br>Amanda Neatrour        <br>Manager, Women's Leadership and Mentorship Program, Robert Morris University  <br>Chelsea Pallatino   <br>Postdoctoral Associate, Magee Women's Research Institute  <br>Jessie Ramey         <br>Director, Women's Institute, Chatham University  <br>Sarah Schulz         <br>Assistant Professor of Psychology, Point Park University  <br>Mike Strelic           <br>Senior Budget Analyst, City Council Budget Office, City of Pittsburgh  <br>Ricardo Williams          <br>Manager of Equity & Inclusion, Bureau of Neighborhood Empowerment; Administrator, Equal Opportunities Review Commission (EORC), City of Pittsburgh | 1/3/2018 08:47:34 |

| Affordable Housing Initiatives in Hazelwood and Lawrenceville Before URA Board | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 6, 2018) Affordable housing initiatives in Hazelwood and Lawrenceville are set to go before the Urban Development Authority board of directors on Thursday, further expanding the agency's support of housing programs in the two neighborhoods. <br>In Hazelwood the board will consider a $30,000 grant for a Homeownership Incubator project by the Hazelwood Initiative (HI) that will renovate a blighted vacant house and transform it into two affordable rental units.  <br>HI will lease the units to households that are interested in learning to become homeowners. The households occupying the units will enroll in monthly homeownership counseling sessions while repairing their credit, and a portion the tenant’s monthly rent will be set aside toward their down payment requirements.  <br>The expectation is that one household per year will become a homeowner through this incubator program, which has an overall budget of $197,750.  <br>While the project involves only a single building, HI regards this initiative as a key component of a larger strategy to reduce blight and increase homeownership for low-to-moderate income Hazelwood residents. <br>Rebuilding Together Pittsburgh has been the general contractor for HI’s “Rehab for Resale” imitative and is a partner in the Discount Home Repair Program. The URA has supplied HI with grants, loans and second mortgages for "Rehab for Resale,"  which supported the renovation of more than six homes to date. They have all been sold to households with incomes at or below 80%  <br>In Upper Lawrenceville the URA board will consider a $50,000 grant to support scattered site land acquisition and housing rehabilitation in phase two of the Lawrenceville Community Land Trust, which aims to build four new affordable units in the neighborhood at a total cost of $1 million. <br>Land trusts create permanently affordable home ownership opportunities for individuals who have been priced out of the private market. They build homes that are guaranteed to be permanently affordable and if sold provide sellers a return on investments while ensuring  homebuyers at the same income level have access to affordable homes. <br>The URA provided $445,000 in grant funding for the 7-unit ($2.222 million) phase one Community Land Trust development.  All 7 units will be permanently affordable to households with incomes at or below 80% AMI. <br>The Lawrenceville Corporation and Lawrenceville United contracted with EvolveEA to lead a community planning process for Upper Lawrenceville with funding from the Design Center. With the input of over 200 residents and a neighborhood steering committee, the Upper Lawrenceville Community Plan was released in the summer of 2013. One of the priorities of the Community Plan is that Upper Lawrenceville must offer “housing for all,” and that community partners must move to ensure that both economic diversity and affordability are maintained amidst the exponential growth in the residential real estate market. | 6/3/2018 12:09:37 |
| City Announces Publicly Funded Art Program for Uptown Neighborhood | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 6, 2018)  The Public Art and Civic Design Division of the Department of City Planning is currently seeking proposals from an artist, an artist collective, an arts institution, educational institution, or designers, to implement a public art project within the Uptown EcoInnovation District (EID).<br>Artists should propose a concept for the project, and the artist will be selected based on this concept and will work with City Planning staff and the community to develop a final proposal. The first site that will be utilized for this initial project will be Tustin Park, located at 2028 Tustin St.<br>There will be a series of three permanent art installations within the EID, the first project being awarded [via this March 2 request for proposals](https://webprocure.perfect.com/MainBidBoard?ac=4&docid=493798&owner_id=106509&bid=68576). Two subsequent RFPs will be released for the additional projects. The deadline for submission for the current RFP is March 30, 2018.<br>The Public Art and Civic Design Division (PA+CD) promotes and ensures quality design of city-owned architecture, infrastructure, and landscape in order to create and enhance place-making by the inclusion of art and arts programming to reflect the city's history, diversity, and culture. The division performs three main functions: administering the City's Art Commission; conservation and maintenance of the City's collection of public artwork, monuments, and memorials, and; implementation of new commissions of public art and arts programs and initiatives on City property, citywide.<br>Working with the neighborhood planner for Uptown, PA+CD plans to implement a project that aligns with its goals and principles as well as the recently adopted Uptown / West Oakland EcoInnovation District (EID) community plan.<br>The EcoInnovation District (EID) Plan establishes a community vision for equitable and sustainable development in one of Pittsburgh’s oldest neighborhoods. The planning process led by the Department of City Planning included monthly community steering committee meetings that helped guide the development of the plan, 70+ interviews and focus groups, block parties and open house events attended by over 600 residents and stakeholders, and a robust online presence that drew over 10,000 visitors. The plan was adopted by the City’s Planning Commission in September of 2017 and work began immediately to implement the document’s bold vision.<br>The first project to implement the EcoInnovation District Plan was the creation of innovative new tools in the City’s Zoning Code that sought to unlock the development potential of the neighborhood while making sure that new buildings address community goals and are consistent with the principles of the City and Heinz Foundation’s p4 Collaboration. This unique approach to development continued with a community-led design process for a key publicly owned development site at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Dinwiddie Street. In Uptown, there has been a clear and consistent desire to improve the safety and health of the neighborhood at the same time that it becomes a more vibrant and amenity-rich urban environment. With an active community of artists and significant collection of artwork on display, there is a strong desire for art to continue to play a role in expressing the community’s identity.<br>The Public Art and Civic Design Division is launching the Uptown Art Program as one of the first initiatives to realize the EcoInnovation District Plan vision. Three sites are being selected in collaboration with the community for artistic interventions ranging from experiential objects to interactive experiences.<br>**Contact:**<br>Yesica Guerra<br>Public Art and Civic Design Manager<br>City of Pittsburgh<br>Department of City Planning<br>200 Ross St. 4th floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15219<br>\[p\] 412.255.8996<br>\[e\] yesica.guerra@pittsburghpa.gov | 6/3/2018 11:06:50 |
| Major Fund Supporting Women-Owned Businesses Goes to URA Board | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 6, 2018) The board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority is poised to provide $100,000 towards funding for a $5 million fund to support women-owned businesses in the city. Next Act Fund, LLC ("Next Act") is an early stage women-owned business focused venture fund. Next Act's mission is to invest in early-stage, women owned companies in Pittsburgh.  <br>Next Act will fill an important gap in Pittsburgh's early stage business capital flow by focusing on women-led companies. Next Act is already building significant interest from local women entrepreneurs with over 50 Pittsburgh companies preliminarily engaged for possible funding.  <br>Next Act plans to use its initial $2.5 million fund raise to invest in up to 40 companies. The average investment will be $75,000 per company with a range of $50,000 to $100,00. The vast majority of these companies are likely to be located in the City of Pittsburgh. Additionally, the substantial majority of those investing in the funds are women making their first angel investments. <br>The URA plays an important and significant role in support of Pittsburgh's entrepreneurial eco-system. URA direct business investment programs such as Pittsburgh Entrepreneur Fund and URA supported investment tools and programs such as Keystone Innovation Zones, Riverfront Ventures, Alpha Lab Gear, several co-working spaces, and more critical elements of this eco-system—creating and growing hundreds of Pittsburgh businesses creating thousands of jobs across the City of Pittsburgh. <br>"As the URA advances its commitment to p4, Next Act provides an opportunity to strengthen their commitment in support of women entrepreneurs and to expand their impact by leveraging substantial private investment." said Mayor William Peduto. | 6/3/2018 15:49:48 |

I would not have continued to be City Solicitor for this long had this not been the case." <br>Sanchez Ridge also thanked Pittsburgh City Council and City of Pittsburgh employees. <br>"I would be remiss if I didn't mention my gratitude for the support that City Council has given me through the years. The people of Pittsburgh elected committed and honorable people. I have worked very closely with all Council members in passing legislation and addressing their legal needs. They have always been respectful and collaborative. Pittsburgh's best asset is its people. I am honored to have served them and will continue to do so in any way I can." | 8/3/2018 14:14:15 |

I look forward to working with my colleagues on council in passing this partnership agreement and continuing our work to make the park improvements a reality."  <br>"Bringing green infrastructure and landscape improvements to McKinley Park is an exciting step forward for District 4," Coghill said. "We know that storm water management is a major issue in our district and I am proud to be a part of working towards a solution." <br>The work is expected to cost up to $373,000. The Department of Public Works will perform some of the upgrades and the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy – which first applied for grant funding for the project in 2015 – will install and maintain some of the green components. <br>“The Parks Conservancy’s green infrastructure work brings value to Pittsburgh through stormwater management and improved health of park ecosystems, supportive habitat for plants and animals, and visual enhancement of the park landscape,” said Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy Director of Community Projects Heather Sage. “We are thrilled to continue this work by bringing these benefits to McKinley Park and the communities that surround it.” <br>If approved, construction is expected to begin in May. | 13/3/2018 11:20:37 |

| Pittsburgh Department of City Planning Announces Neighborhood Conservation Districts Working Group Open Call | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 14, 2018) The City is seeking applicants to participate in a working group to establish the framework for the Neighborhood Conservation District (NCD) zoning overlay. This is a planning tool that could be used in different neighborhoods. This process is to develop the tool that will be available for neighborhoods, not to identify the specific neighborhoods where it could be applied as it is intended that neighborhoods will determine potential locations through neighborhood plans or other planning efforts.<br>The City of Pittsburgh’s Cultural Heritage Plan called for study to determine the feasibility of adding Conservation Overlay Districts as part of the Zoning Code. Subsequently, City Council passed legislation that supports the possible development of conservation districts and backs the adoption of legislation that will allow for the establishment of these districts. This lead to work initiated by the Department of City Planning with Winter & Company studying the application of Conservation Districts. The NCD Working Group will take that work and define how neighborhood conservation districts can be applied in Pittsburgh and develop guidelines that will delineate eligibility for future NCD overlay candidates.<br>Neighborhood Conservation Districts are a zoning overlay tool intended to protect a neighborhood’s character. This overlay will consider the relationship between place and architecture and community.<br>Neighborhood Conservation Districts will be used to conserve and enhance significant areas within a community beyond what is specified in the existing zoning code in Pittsburgh.<br>The Department of City Planning will work with the NCD working group to establish the structure of the Neighborhood Conservation Districts definition citywide and the Guidelines that will govern this overlay. The NCD policy requires a broad consensus among experts in urban design, architecture, planning and culture with a strong knowledge of the City’s neighborhoods.<br>Applicants for the NCD working group should have architectural experience and expertise discipline with a strong and diverse urban design aesthetics and experience. The working group also welcomes applicants with other backgrounds like urban sociology, community development, public art, cultural and architectural history. The applicants should be willing to dedicate a minimum of four hours a month for a period of six months.<br>To learn more about NCD’s & to apply to the NCD Working group please visit our website at:<br>[http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/projects/ncd/index.html](http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/projects/ncd/index.html)<br>Contact Information:<br>Felipe Palomo LEED AP BD+C – Project Manager<br>Neighborhood Planner<br>Department of City Planning<br>[felipe.palomo@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:felipe.palomo@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>412.393.0160 | 14/3/2018 13:10:22 |
| Street Closures, Shuttle Services and Other Activities Detailed for St. Patrick's Day | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 14, 2018) Several main thoroughfares throughout Downtown Pittsburgh will be closed Saturday, March 17, for the St. Patrick's Day Parade. Other measures are in place for those patronizing South Side businesses on Saturday. <br>Downtown street closures will begin at 7:30 a.m. along the parade route, which includes Liberty Avenue, Grant Street, the Boulevard of the Allies and the parade's end at Stanwix Street.  <br>Streets will be opened up again at approximately 1 p.m.  <br>The parade will form on Liberty Avenue from 11th to 26th streets.   <br>Parking will be restricted along the parade route, including in the staging area and other locations reserved for bus parking and/or parade-related activities. <br>During the parade, the St. Patrick's Day Parade Committee will once again host a family friendly event in Market Square from 10:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m.  <br>After the parade the Market Square Merchants Association will hold the "Irish Fair in the Square" event in Market Square, beginning at 1:00 p.m. Participating restaurants and bars can serve alcohol at their sidewalk cafes, and open containers will be allowed in the plaza space of Market Square starting at 2:00 p.m. and ending at 5:30 p.m. Market Square will be cleared of patrons by 6:00 p.m.    <br>Roads leading into Market Square will be closed to through traffic.  <br>Pittsburgh Public Safety personnel will be patrolling in Downtown and the South Side through the day and evening. There will be zero tolerance for driving while intoxicated or disorderly conduct.  <br>For those patronizing the South Side, the Second Avenue Parking Plaza will be open for 24 hours of free parking and free shuttle services from the lot to the South Side, beginning at 5 a.m. Saturday. Riders can find where the shuttles are located with the Real Time Shuttle Tracker at [www.ssNiteRider.com](http://www.ssniterider.com/).  <br>Starting this year a new NiteRider shuttle stop has been added to the First Street Parking Garage and T Station, so visitors can ride the T, get off at First Avenue and ride the NiteRider directly to the activities on the South Side.  <br>Shuttles and shuttle stops will be marked with shamrocks. <br>Those celebrating St. Patrick's Day are urged do so responsibly and to use public transportation, cabs or ride-sharing services to get around the city. <br>“This St. Patrick's Day, everyone has a role to play in keeping our communities safe,” said Craig Ewer, Uber Pennsylvania spokesperson. “Whether you take an Uber, a bus, or a train, we urge you to plan ahead and don’t drink and drive.” <br>Lyft Marketing Manager Josh Huber said, "Lyft worked with the Pittsburgh police to identify pick-up locations that work with the expected crowds in the South Side and scheduled road closures throughout Downtown." <br>To facilitate traffic flow and emergency access to the neighborhood, no parking will be allowed in the public safety lane on East Carson Street between 12th and 17th starting at 4 a.m. Saturday, March 17 until 4 a.m. Sunday, March 18.  <br>South Side parking meters will be operating and enforced as normal on Saturday until midnight, as will the Residential Parking Permit areas.  <br>The Department of Public Works will be cleaning streets after the celebrations and will do their best to attend to trash cans during events, though that work may be impeded by heavy traffic. | 14/3/2018 11:03:19 |
| City of Pittsburgh Seeks Input on Statue Honoring African American Woman | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 14, 2018) Mayor William Peduto and his Task Force on Women in Public Art are seeking the public's help in selecting an African American woman to be honored with a statue at the site of the Stephen Foster statue in North Oakland. <br>There are very few monuments in Pittsburgh dedicated to the many women leaders who have left their mark on the city. At present, there are no African American women represented. As the Stephen Foster statue is set to be removed from its current site in April, the city has a unique opportunity to build something in its place honoring the legacy of African American women and their impressive leadership in Pittsburgh.  <br>Public art is a vehicle to tell local histories, to enhance quality of life, to add beauty and value to the urban landscape and to inspire people across all cultures, generations and economic circumstances. The City of Pittsburgh believes in inclusivity and equality, and ensuring that all can see themselves in the art around them. It is imperative then that our public art reflect the diversity of our city and that we accordingly represent our diverse heroes. <br>The Peduto administration has been working with a myriad of organizations including Gwen’s Girls, Hill House Association, Manchester Craftsmen's Guild, Women and Girls Foundation, the Women’s Institute at Chatham University and the Urban League to begin the process of commissioning public art representing women of color and their many notable achievements. To that end they are urging that the Pittsburgh community be involved in helping to select an African American woman be honored in statue-form in place of the Stephen Foster installation. <br>Community meetings to gather public input will soon be scheduled and a web forum will be open so that residents can nominate African American women who should be celebrated as a statue. The forum can be found at [http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/survey/index.html](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/survey/index.html). <br>The Task Force will use input from the community meetings to inform a Request for Proposals that will be issued for the artwork. The City’s Public Art Commission will review and deliberate on the proposed location and artwork. The Public Art and Civic Design Division in collaboration with other city departments will then support the procurement and installation process. <br>The Task Force on Women in Public Art was formed last year by the Mayor's Chief of Staff Dan Gilman when he was still on City Council. Members include: <br>Heather Arnet, Chief Executive Officer of the Women and Girls Foundation <br>Terri Baltimore, Director of Neighborhood Engagement of the Hill House Association <br>Olivia Benson, Community Engagement Director of the Women and Girls Foundation <br>Esther Bush, President & CEO of the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh <br>Dr. Kathi Elliot, Executive Director of Gwen's Girls <br>Kevin Jenkins, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild <br>Dr. Jessie B Ramey, Director of the Women's Institute at Chatham University <br>Valerie McDonald-Roberts, Chief of Urban Affairs <br>Itha Cao, Policy Analyst <br>Gloria Forouzan, Office Manager <br>Yesica Guerra, Public Art and Civic Design Manager <br>Lindsay Powell, Policy Analyst <br>“As Mayor, I am excited and passionate about this project. Public art shows what we value and want to memorialize for all to see," Mayor Peduto said. "I look forward to the community’s input to see how we can remember and commemorate African American women and all their contributions in the City of Pittsburgh." | 14/3/2018 15:28:42 |

| **Application Period Opens for 2018 Learn & Earn Summer Youth Employment Program**<br>_County, City, Partner4Work Call on Employers to Host or Sponsor Corporate Interns_ |

|     |
| --- |
| **PITTSBURGH, PA (March 19, 2018) –** Allegheny County, the City of Pittsburgh and Partner4Work today announced the opening of the application period for the Learn & Earn Summer Youth Employment Program and called on area employers to inspire the next generation of talent by participating in Learn & Earn’s Corporate Internship component.<br>Learn & Earn annually connects nearly 2,000 underserved Allegheny County and Pittsburgh residents ages 14 through 21 with 6-week summer jobs in high-demand sectors including health care, education and STEM. There is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to the summer employment program. Learn & Earn opportunities can range from career exploration activities, service-learning or work-study to entrepreneurship and corporate internships.<br>“The Learn & Earn Program has provided thousands of youth in our community an opportunity to see what future jobs may exist in our region. After their experience, they can take that knowledge and skills they have learned to set themselves on a path to connecting with those jobs,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “Our region is experiencing growth and, with that, comes a chance to plan and find ways to connect our workforce with the jobs that exist today and tomorrow. ‘Future. Forged. For All.’ is not just a slogan, but is what we want our region to be like for generations to come. The Learn & Earn Program helps us get there.”<br>Last year, 25 Learn & Earn providers connected young people with jobs at 350 businesses, where they collectively earned $1.5 million in wages, while exploring career options, gaining work experience, and developing soft skills in areas such as communications and teamwork.<br>“Through our partnership with Allegheny County and Partner4Work, we are breaking down barriers that prevent young adults from acquiring the work experience and skills needed to become career-ready for in-demand occupations,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Now in its fourth year, Learn & Earn has become a model for summer youth employment programs, bringing together businesses, non-profits and local government to deliver meaningful work experiences that inspire and engage young adults.”<br>The program’s success relies on business leaders supporting Learn & Earn by participating in the Corporate Internship program. The program offers 50 underserved young adults, ages 18-21, the ability to expand their career-readiness skills through paid professional internships in high growth industries and occupations. This highly selective subprogram chooses candidates based on past work experience, leadership abilities and career goals. Employers can host an intern or sponsor internships with leading local non-profits. Learn & Earn will screen all candidates, arrange interviews, provide ongoing training and support, and process the paperwork and payroll.<br>“We invite the business community to partner with Learn & Earn’s Corporate Internship program to develop the next generation of skilled talent our regional economy needs to thrive,” said Debra L. Caplan, Partner4Work Interim CEO.  “Alongside our partners, Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh, we are excited to build on the successes of Learn & Earn programming to prepare young adults for career paths in expanding occupations.”<br>- Beginning today, Learn & Earn will accept applications for summer 2018 job opportunities. The work period begins June 25 and runs through August 3, 2018. **The application period ends at 11 p.m, Friday, May 4**. Interested youth may complete the application online at [www.jobs4summer.org](http://www.jobs4summer.org/) or visit in-person application sites for extra support in completing the application. A map of the support sites is available at [www.jobs4summer.org](http://www.jobs4summer.org/).<br>- Employers interested in participating in the Corporate Internship program should contact Shuly Goldman, Learn & Earn manager, at 412-552-7090 or [sgoldman@partner4work.org](mailto:sgoldman@partner4work.org).<br>**About Partner4Work**<br>Nationally recognized for innovation, Partner4Work, formerly Three Rivers Workforce Investment Board, is the workforce development organization that connects funding, expertise and opportunities for employers, job seekers, agencies, and policy makers to develop a thriving workforce in the Pittsburgh area. As stewards of more than $21 million in public and private workforce funds, Partner4Work oversees and funds workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers and youth; educates the community through labor market analytics; and implements innovative solutions to the region’s systemic workforce challenges.

| City Of Pittsburgh's Sexual Harassment Policy | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 20, 2018) As a part of the City of Pittsburgh’s continuing commitment to creating as safe and productive work environment for all employees, Pittsburgh municipal leadership will be introducing legislation to create an expanded set of protections and procedures to prevent workplace harassment.  <br>The centerpiece of this effort will be a new ordinance requiring the Department of Human Relations & Civil Service to institute a mandatory anti-harassment training program, the first of its kind in City of Pittsburgh history, sponsored by Council President Kraus.  <br>“If we are to continue our work to make Pittsburgh a truly world-class city, we must continue to hire and develop a world-class workforce,” Council President Kraus said. “Every employee has the right to work in a safe and harassment free environment, and we set the example for all employers in the region with our high level of professionalism and training in harassment prevention.” <br>“Every City of Pittsburgh employee has the right to a harassment-free work environment,” said Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto.” As Mayor, I am committed to ensuring that rigorous anti-harassment training is available to all employees and that we continue to encourage a culture of civility in the workplace." <br>Additionally, Councilman Corey O’Connor will introduce legislation forbidding the use of non-disclosure agreements as part of any potential settlement with victims of harassment in the workplace, a practice which sees many victims lose their rights and dignity in the event of a harassment or discrimination incident. <br>"We need to make sure that the City of Pittsburgh leads by example. We must do what we can to prevent any and all types of harassment, protect victims when it does occur, and properly address offenders," said Councilman Corey O'Connor. <br>“We currently comply with Equal Employment Opportunity requirements but the message we are sending with these ordinances is that we will do more to ensure civility in the workplace and be better,” said acting Human Resources and Civil Service Director Janet Manuel. | 20/3/2018 13:13:28 |

| UPDATED: Mayor Peduto To Attend March For Our Lives | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 23, 2018) We stand in solidarity with students who are demanding change and in support of the student actions that have occurred in schools within the city and around the region. Students from more than 30 schools in the region participated in the National Walkout Day on March 14th, 2018. These students stood united with other young people from around the country to ensure that schools are a place for learning and growth, not fear and tragedy. Students are demanding action to end the public health crisis of gun violence at school. The student’s participated in this national action by observing 17 minutes of silence or walking out of class for 17 minutes. This was to acknowledge and reflect on the lives of the 17 individuals that lost their lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on February 14th, 2018.  <br>We applaud the leadership of students in our region who are demanding change. Nia Arrington, a senior at Pittsburgh Public School CAPA and intern at One PA states "…the students in this city are tired of feeling like our voices are not heard so we are going to begin to demand change from our city, our government officials and our schools to ensure that real change will come out of this. We are marching for our lives so that our children will not have to march for theirs."<br>All students deserve a learning environment where they can feel safe and should not have to worry about being gunned down in their classrooms or on their school campus. In order to keep students safe there is a need for bipartisan collective action. The Welcoming Pittsburgh Youth Advisory Committee says “It is important for every student to know that regardless of if they can vote, they can make a difference. Students have always been on the forefront of change, whether it has been in Birmingham, Alabama or right here in Pittsburgh Public Schools. We are proud of Pittsburgh area students for raising their voices to create an impact on the issue of safety in schools. Youth are not only the future, but the present. As students stand up and use their voices to call for change across the United States, Pittsburgh will stand alongside them." The powerful voices of students have changed the national conversation around school safety and as public servants it is up to us to advocate for the reforms that are needed to keep them safe. Our administration will continue to honor the voices of students and to amplify their message.   <br>Schools that participated in the March 14th as a demonstration for National Walkout Day (per Pittsburgh Public School):  <br>- Taylor Allderdice High School <br>- Greenfield Elementary-Middle School <br>- Brashear High School <br>- Brookline PreK-8 <br>- Pittsburgh Obama <br>- Pittsburgh CAPA <br>- Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy <br>March For Our Lives participants will begin gathering on the portico at City-County Building at 11:30 a.m.. Remarks will take place on the portico 11:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.. The march will begin at Noon and end in Market Square wiith additional speeches and appearances by student activists, local thought leaders, and City and State representatives. | 23/3/2018 16:16:37 |

| City of Pittsburgh To Notify Buildings That Must Comply With Building Benchmarking Ordinance | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 26, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh announced today that the Division of Sustainability and Resilience, a part of the Department of City Planning, will be sending notification letters to the owners of all buildings that must comply with the Pittsburgh Building Benchmarking Ordinance (Ord. No. 29-2016). The letter will include a guide on how to comply and additional information about the benefits of regularly monitoring building performance. <br>Passed in October 2016, the Pittsburgh Building Benchmarking Ordinance requires owners of all non-residential buildings over 50,000 sq. Ft. to track and report annual energy and water consumption data to the City. Starting this year, the data for buildings required to report must be submitted to the City by June 1st. Following this submission period, the City will prepare a report to contextualize this data and make it publicly available.  <br>Buildings in Pittsburgh account for 81% of the City’s greenhouse gas emissions. Benchmarking gives building engineers, managers, owners, and tenants valuable information on how their buildings perform over time, as well as how they compare to peer buildings.  <br>While the Building Benchmarking Ordinance does not require buildings owners to take any measures to reduce energy or water use, elsewhere the increased awareness of energy and water use brought about by benchmarking has been shown to result in a 4 to 7 percent reduction in utility use. <br>More information about the ordinance, how to comply, and the list of buildings that must comply can be found at: [http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/programs/building-benchmarking](http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/programs/building-benchmarking). <br>If you have any questions concerning the building benchmarking ordiance please contact Flore Marion, [Flore.Marion@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Flore.Marion@pittsburghpa.gov). | 26/3/2018 15:48:24 |

| Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections Modernizes Business Operations | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 2, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections is submitting updates to its operating procedures to Pittsburgh City Council tomorrow, including new abilities for online permitting. The package of three ordinance amendments and one trust fund amendment is the first comprehensive update since the original ordinances were written in the early 1980s. <br>With these updates, the Department will be able to put into action many best practices that have been overlooked for decades. They include: <br>- Online applications <br>  <br>- A predictable and equitable fee structure <br>  <br>- A dedicated review lane for projects under a strict timeline <br>  <br>- Requiring contractors to be specialized in fire protection systems in order to work on fire suppression jobs <br>  <br>- Maintaining a transparent standard of license pre-qualifications. <br>  <br>In conjunction with the City-wide permitting and licensing software project, Burghware, the legislation is part of [ongoing modernization efforts within PLI](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1403). Upon approval of the legislative updates and completion of the first phase of Burghware, customers will be able to submit license applications online starting this fall without ever having to come to the counter at 200 Ross Street.

| Mayor William Peduto Issues Executive Order on Paid Safe Leave Policy for Victims of Domestic Abuse | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 3, 2018) Mayor William Peduto joined community partners today to announce an Executive Order creating a Paid Safe Leave policy for city employees victimized by domestic abuse. <br>Many individuals in the city – and particularly women – face intimate partner violence, which can lead to lost workdays and cuts in pay. Those who experience intimate partner violence typically forfeit 7.2 days of work-related lost productivity according to the National Partnership on Women and Girls.   <br>The Mayor's Executive Order directs the Department of Human Resources and Civil Service to create a policy that provides relief for those facing domestic abuse while also protecting their privacy and confidentiality. It will be offered to all non-union employees. <br>"It is critical that we provide our most vulnerable city employees with needed resources to address these life threatening circumstances," Mayor Peduto said. <br>The Mayor was joined at a press conference by Department of Human Resources and Civil Service Director Janet Manuel and representatives from organizations including the city's Gender Equity Commission, the National Council of Jewish Women, the Women's Law Project, Pittsburgh Action Against Rape and the Women's Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh. <br>While the Executive Order impacts only non-union City employees (since their workplace conditions are not subject to collective bargaining) it is hoped that Paid Safe Leave will ultimately be adopted for workers across the public and private sectors in Pittsburgh. <br>The [full order is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2197_04_3_18_Paid_Safe_Leave_EO_(1).docx). | 3/4/2018 10:23:20 |

| City and Carnegie Mellon University Highlight Data Tool That Predicts Fire-Prone Buildings | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 4, 2018) Mayor William Peduto joined officials from the Departments of Public Safety and Innovation & Performance and from Carnegie Mellon University today to detail their latest collaborative efforts to use data sharing to provide Pittsburgh residents with better city services. <br>The Mayor lauded a predictive model built by CMU Ph.D. student Michael A. Madaio that determines fire risk in the city's commercial buildings, which since last year the Fire Bureau has used to help inform its fire inspections. There are roughly 22,000 commercial properties in the city and the Bureau cannot inspect every last one, so the model from Madaio, a doctoral student at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, helps the Bureau prioritize its inspection work. <br>The model was built with data including historical fire incidents from 2009-2017, property assessment and valuation data and non-fire related inspection data from the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections. It is updated every week. <br>In the project's first six months, beginning in July 2017, the model identified 57 properties with a high-risk of fire. Of that number 50 of the properties (or 88%) indeed experienced fire incidents. <br>"The technology being pioneered in Pittsburgh is making residents safer, and it is proven to work," Mayor Peduto said. <br>New York City and Atlanta have similar predictive modeling technology for fires but only the model designed for Pittsburgh is updated every week, using assistance from Innovation & Performance and the [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](http://www.wprdc.org/). <br>The Mayor said similar predictive analysis is planned for the Bureau of Police and that Pittsburgh – working with university and foundation partners – is poised to become a worldwide leader in the predictive analytics field. <br>Further details [on Madaio's work are available here](http://michaelmadaio.com/Metro21_FireRisk_FinalReport.pdf). His research is a project of CMU's [Metro21 Smart Cities Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/metro21/), which is a multidisciplinary effort to find ways to improve quality of life for residents of urban areas. Carnegie Mellon’s Smart Cities work has also contributed to improved traffic flow, pollution reduction, and public safety efforts in Pittsburgh. <br>In 2015 the Peduto Administration and CMU were founding members of the national MetroLab Network, which similarly works to find solutions to challenges facing metropolitan regions. | 4/4/2018 14:05:35 |

Said, Director Karina Ricks.  "A strategic approach to Smart City technology helps us do that work safer, more efficiently, more sustainably, and more equitable".  <br>“Whether electric scooters, new dockless bike-sharing systems, curbside delivery, or ride-sourcing services, the pace of innovation is accelerating, and these technologies and new mobility options are already on our streets and having a tangible impact in our communities,” said Russ Brooks, T4America’s Director of Smart Cities. “Pittsburgh  and our other participating cities are eager to work together and cooperate, not only to bring these new technologies to their communities, but also to ensure that they are directed toward solving their most pressing transportation challenges and helping them become more efficient, safe, and equitable places to live and work.”    <br>This year’s cohort will focus on how emerging technologies and new mobility options are reshaping the right-of-way and curb space and changing the way we move through our communities.    <br>"From the gold standard partnership between the City and our research universities to our selection as a finalist in the USDOT Smart City Challenge, Pittsburgh has been a leader in leveraging technology to solve real challenges in our communities.  We're grateful for the opportunity to share with and learn from our cohort partners to build a Smarter City," said Mayor William Peduto.  <br>The City of Pittsburgh was selected from a group of 50 cities that applied to be a part of the Collaborative this year. The inaugural cohort of cities tackled challenges related to automated vehicles, shared mobility and how to use data to manage complex transportation networks.    <br>The Collaborative will hold its first meeting in Denver on April 16-17. Throughout the year Pittsburgh will participate in a variety of interactive workshops, both with the other cities and with industry-leading transportation experts. From there, the participants will receive direct technical assistance and share the results of their projects with the rest of the Collaborative to drive best practices across the country.   <br>The full list of 22 communities participating in the Collaborative in 2018 are: <br>**Atlanta, GA**<br>**Austin, TX**<br>**Boulder, CO**<br>**Centennial, CO**<br>**Gainesville, FL**<br>**Houston, TX**<br>**Indianapolis, IN**<br>**Los Angeles, CA,**<br>**Madison, WI**<br>**Miami-Dade, FL**<br>**Minneapolis, MN**<br>**New York, NY**<br>**Pittsburgh, PA**<br>**Portland, OR**<br>**San Diego, CA**<br>**San Francisco, CA**<br>**San Jose, CA**<br>**Santa Monica, CA**<br>**Seattle, WA**<br>**Toronto, ON**<br>**Washington, DC**<br>**West Sacramento, CA**<br>### <br>ABOUT TRANSPORTATION FOR AMERICA  <br>Transportation for America is an alliance of elected, business and civic leaders from communities across the country, united to ensure that states and the federal government step up to invest in smart, homegrown, locally-driven transportation solutions — because these are the investments that hold the key to our future economic prosperity.

| Pittsburgh Retains Bond Rating by Fitch | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 5, 2018) [Fitch Ratings](https://www.fitchratings.com/site/home) today affirmed the City's AA- bond rating and judged its financial outlook to be stable. <br>The ratings "incorporate the city's improved operating performance, including its exceptionally strong ability to manage through downturns given a solid reserve cushion and significant independent legal ability to increase revenues," [the Fitch report said](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2239_Fitch_Pittsburgh_040518.pdf). <br>The bond rating affirmation was the first [since the City exited Act 47 fiscally distressed status](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1475) in February. <br>"The city recently exited the Commonwealth's Fiscal Recovery Act (Act 47), which provided strong state oversight and significant control over expenditures. Despite the absence of state oversight, Fitch believes that Pittsburgh is well positioned to manage its budget in line with the current rating level," the report said. | 5/4/2018 15:33:35 |

| URA Board Set to Support Affordable Housing in North Side, Hill District and Hilltop | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 10, 2018) The board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority is set to vote Thursday on three resolutions supporting 160 affordable housing units in the North Side, Hill District, and three Hilltop communities in southern Pittsburgh. <br>One resolution would issue financing debt for the redevelopment of 126 affordable housing properties in the North Side communities of California-Kirkbride, Central Northside and Perry South. The URA is poised to issue up to $23.9 million in debt for the project, which is expected to take up to eight years. <br>The project includes the historic rehabilitation of 124 units and new construction of two replacement units.  Renovations will include new roofs, windows, flooring, appliances and updated kitchens and bathrooms.  Most the units will be gutted and reframed, and will receive all new mechanical systems.  The approximate construction cost per unit is $175,000. <br>Another resolution asks the URA board to issue roughly $4 million in debt and enter exclusive negotiations with developer Ralph A. Falbo for the redevelopment of the Western Restoration buildings in the Middle Hill District into affordable rental housing. <br>The subject property is the former Tuberculosis Hospital building located at 2591 Bedford Avenue. Plans are for a total of 24 affordable units developed in the three existing buildings. The developer will upgrade all common areas including sidewalks, common area lighting, apartment kitchens, and bathrooms. The project includes approximately $135,000 per unit in renovation costs and the estimated total project cost is $6.7 million.  <br>The financing plan will restrict occupancy to households with incomes at or below 60% of area median income (AMI).  <br>A final resolution would grant $25,000 for the rehabilitation of up to 10 affordable homes in the Hilltop neighborhoods of Carrick, Allentown and Knoxville.  <br>The agreement is with Rebuilding Together Pittsburgh (RTP) to cover soft costs for the project, which is expected to have a total project cost of $545,485. The majority of the homeowners served will have incomes at or below 50% of the area median income (AMI).   <br>In the past, URA has entered into grant agreements with RTP to rehabilitate homes in Homewood, Hazelwood, Allentown and the Upper Hill District. | 10/4/2018 13:40:29 |

| City of Pittsburgh Joins Effort to Recruit Workers with Disabilities | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 12, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh and Mayor William Peduto are actively seeking to recruit workers with disabilities, becoming the latest Pittsburgh-area employers to join the "21 & Able" Career Transition Project, an employee recruitment and retention initiative. <br>Almost 1,000 individuals with disabilities graduate high school and enter the local job market every year. 21 & Able, an initiative of the United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania, makes connections between those job-seekers and major area employers.  <br>This week the City began to implement the Career Transition Project (CTP), which over the past four years has connected 366 individuals ages 18-38 with disabilities to competitive employment in community organizations throughout Allegheny County. <br>Studies show that these workers normally hold positions longer than those without disabilities and have fewer scheduled and unscheduled absences than those without disabilities. <br>"A public service career within city government can be a life-changing experience for anyone, but especially someone with disabilities. I am honored that we have become part of this program," Mayor Peduto said. <br>This week the City's Human Resources and Civil Service Department under Director Janet Manuel began introducing all city departments to the hiring initiative, which will be aided by Sabrina Clay-Brown, a Career Transition Professional (CTP) who will be embedded in the HRCS department. <br>Her role will be to act as a non-traditional recruiter and job coach with the goal to act as career counselor for individuals with disabilities. She will assist and identify qualified job seekers of diverse backgrounds who are ready for a competitive work environment. <br>She will also work with City officials to:  <br>- Provide recruiting assistance, guidance, training and general support to city departments regarding the hiring of individuals with disabilities. <br>  <br>- Identify qualified candidates, assist them through the application process and serve as a resource for candidates through the selection process. <br>  <br>The City of Pittsburgh joins other major employers including Giant Eagle, Peoples Gas, Fed-Ex, Allegheny County and the University of Pittsburgh in participating in the program.  <br>Participating agencies include: Life’s Work of Western PA; Blind and Vision Rehabilitation Services of Pittsburgh; the Pennsylvania Office of Vocational Rehabilitation (OVR); Achieva; Evolve Coaching Autism support and job coaches; United Way; and Bender Consulting Services. | 12/4/2018 10:35:08 |

In addition to the city's work there will be:  <br>- 8.93 miles / 143,649 square yards through utility coordination <br>  <br>- 1.20 miles / 18,963 square yards done by utilities alone <br>  <br>- 8.84 miles / 203,581 square yards of mechanical patching  <br>  <br>In all, that totals 54.67 miles of asphalt street paving work this year. <br>The paving list was prepared by DOMI and finalized this week after discussions with members of Pittsburgh City Council on street paving needs in their districts. <br>The city's overall street resurfacing budget for 2018 is nearly $17 million. The Peduto Administration introduced legislation in February adding $800,000 to that budget. | 13/4/2018 10:38:35 |

| Forward/Commercial To Close Again in Advance of Heavy Rains | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 15, 2018) In anticipation of heavy rains expected later today the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) will again temporarily close Forward Avenue and Commercial Street in Squirrel Hill and Swisshelm Park. The street will remain closed at least through tomorrow, Monday, April 16.<br>[Forward/Commercial was reopened](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1703) in the inbound direction toward Squirrel Hill on Friday after city crews established a buffer between a slide area and travel lane. The buffer shifts traffic away from the vulnerable hillside but does not prevent material from encroaching on the road should significant slide activity occur. <br>[The National Weather Service is predicting](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?x=218&y=126&site=pbz&zmx=&zmy=&map_x=217&map_y=126#.WtNyYtPwbOQ) thunderstorms and between 1 to 2 inches of rain starting this evening. DOMI will close Forward/Commercial this afternoon prior to any anticipated heavy rains as a preemptive measure to protect the public. <br>Travelers are advised to adhere to all signs and must not move barricades. The Forward/Commercial corridor will be reopened with the single inbound lane as soon as possible after the rains have passed. | 15/4/2018 11:49:02 |

| Update on Closure of Rialto Street in Troy Hill | _APRIL 18, 2018: Rialto Street remains closed Wednesday due to challenges in repairing the Lowrie Street Bridge._<br>_Rialto Street (which is on a 24% grade) proved to be too steep for workers to use their lift equipment to perform work on the bridge. Contractors were forced to construct stationary scaffolding at the site, which takes more time to both construct and deconstruct and so is leading to delays in both repairs and inspection._<br>_It is hoped the work will be completed today._<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (April 17, 2018) Work crews contracted by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) will be on site at Rialto Street under the Lowrie Street Bridge today to address deficiencies that were identified in the bridge last week.<br>Crews will remove loose concrete from the underside of the bridge and treat the steel structural beams beneath. City and PennDOT inspectors will be on hand to further evaluate the structural integrity of the bridge.<br>If cleared by inspectors the city will remove barricades currently blocking Rialto Street and reopen the street for all users on Wednesday, April 18. The public will be notified if further concerns are discovered and the closure must be maintained.<br>Rialto Street will remain closed while crews work. Pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle traffic may be prohibited from using the Lowrie Street Bridge while crews are actively working on the structure. Work is expected to last no more than one day.<br>Rialto Street [was closed one week ago](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1687) after a routine inspection of the Lowrie Street Bridge found deficiencies that could threaten users of Rialto Street below. | 17/4/2018 11:17:05 |
| City of Pittsburgh Debuts Solar Charging Stations for its Electric Vehicle Fleet | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 18, 2018) Mayor William Peduto joined other city officials today to debut five solar charging stations for the city's growing fleet of electrical vehicles.  <br>The Envision Solar EV ARC charging stations are 100% emissions free. Mayor Peduto is committed to making the city's entire vehicle fleet fossil fuel free by 2030. <br>"These solar charging stations will not only help us expand our portfolio of electric vehicles but also assist Pittsburgh's resilience efforts. They will provide us with a new power source during the increasingly common severe weather events that take the rest of the power grid down," Mayor Peduto said. <br>The units from Envision Solar International in San Diego are also equipped with emergency power (E-power) panels, which allow for their use as emergency generators during disasters or other grid outages.    <br>The City currently has four electric vehicles in its fleet. Later this spring the Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections will be receiving another six new Chevy Bolts. All will be charged at these stations. <br>The stations are currently for the City fleet only but plans are ultimately to allow them for use by the public. <br>An internal combustion car equivalent to the current PLI fleet that drives 8,000 miles per year emits more than 8,000 pounds of CO2 equivalent into the atmosphere each year. Driving a plug-in EV and powering the vehicle from the grid reduces those emissions by 62%; however to charge those vehicles from the grid still emits about 3,000 pounds of CO2 equivalent into the atmosphere each year. <br>"Charging an EV with the EV ARC reduces these carbon emissions by 100%. You are driving on sunshine," said Chuck O'Neill, the city's senior manager of fleet and assets. <br>Enough solar energy is captured in one day to charge up to 225 miles of electric driving per day. Driving 10 DPLI cars consistently on sunshine each year saves more than $8,000 per year in fuel costs.  <br>The cost of each unit was $84,000 but the City will be reimbursed half of the cost through the State’s Alternative Fuels Incentive Grant (AFIG). | 18/4/2018 11:41:19 |
| Rialto Street in Troy Hill Still Closed | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 18, 2018) Crews hired by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure are expected to continue working Thursday on loose material on the Lowrie Street Bridge, which has forced the closure of Rialto Street underneath.<br>[Work on the bridge was delayed to enable crews to erect scaffolding at the site](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1712). Tomorrow crews will continue to work to remove loose material from the bridge and coat supporting steel on the structure. It is hoped Rialto Street can reopen Friday. | 18/4/2018 16:06:10 |
| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Bruno Sammartino | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 18, 2018) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement on the passing of wrestling legend and South Oakland native Bruno Sammartino: <br>"Bruno Sammartino was one of the greatest ambassadors the city of Pittsburgh ever had. Like so many of us, his immigrant family moved here to build a new life, and through his uncommon strength and surprising grace he embodied the spirit of Pittsburgh on the world stage. <br>Some of the fondest memories of my childhood are of sitting in the basement with my grandfather on Saturday afternoons and watching Bruno wrestle. They both came from the same part of Italy, and when my grandfather – who was five-foot-eight – would watch Bruno wrestle he became six-feet-ten. <br>I consider it a great personal honor that Bruno and I later became friends. <br>I join all other Pittsburgh residents in saying 'Thank you, Bruno' and we will miss you." | 18/4/2018 11:39:16 |

| Mayor William Peduto Announces Opposition to Proposed Rule Impacting Immigrant Families | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 19, 2018) Mayor William Peduto has joined efforts to oppose a Trump Administration proposal that would cut assistance to immigrant families. <br>The Mayor issued a letter last week to the Administration regarding its proposed expansion of the public charge rule NPRM (RIN 1615-AA22). The rule, which has not been passed yet can have a profound effect on immigrant families. <br>The [National Immigration Law Center](https://www.nilc.org/) wrote in their Public Charge fact sheet: <br>“The Trump administration is opening a new front in its assault on family-based immigration by making it harder for immigrants who might use essential public services to come to the United States and settle here permanently. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has informed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that it plans to propose regulations that discard longstanding policy about the meaning and application of the “public charge” provisions of immigration law.” <br>**What is “Public Charge”?**<br>The current definition of a “Public Charge” is any individual who is mainly reliant on government assistance. The current policy considers those who utilize cash assistance to help subsidize their income, including Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANFI) program as a public charge.  <br>**What is the current policy?**<br>If authorities determine that an individual is likely to become a “public charge,” that individual can be denied lawful permanent resident (LPR) or entry into the U.S. Under the current policy, individuals or families that use Medicaid, CHIP, or other non-cash benefits were not considered in public charge determinations. <br>**What are the proposed changes?**<br>The proposed changes would consider whether individuals or their dependents have received or sought after any public service, such as CHIP, SNAP, WIC, Section 8 housing vouchers, etc. The federal government will not consider emergency disaster relief and school lunch programs in public charge determinations. <br>**Who would be affected?**<br>It will generally affect noncitizens who are applying for Legal Permanent Resident (LPR-Green Card) status through family-based visa petitions. Some immigrants such as asylees and refugees are exempted from the public charge determinations law. Those who have a Green Card and are applying for citizenship are also exempted from the public charge determinations law. <br>**What are the risks?**<br>If classified as a public charge, a non U.S. citizen can become ineligible for citizenship or permanent residency in the United States. In addition, the public charge determinations law can lead to decreased participation in Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and other programs among legal immigrant families, including their citizen children. (See news link below.) <br>**How can I help?**<br>Speak to your state and local legislators/policy makers about the economic impacts of immigrants and their contributions to the state and the local level. Inform community members that might be affected by the law change if its passes. <br>Mayor Peduto has formally requested a meeting with the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before this rule change is published to discuss the economic significance of these changes to our City. OMB is legally required to accept these meetings.  <br>**The letter sent to OMB read:**<br>Dear Mr. Theroux, <br>As Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh, I am working each day to push forward policies that support all of our residents and foster growth for our region. Like many post-industrial American cities, in order for us to continue on a positive trajectory forward, we must build communities where all are welcome and supported. It is with these goals in mind that I write to request a meeting with you to discuss the public charge NPRM (RIN 1615-AA22) currently under your review. <br>The proposed rule creates a significant economic hardship that will directly impact local and state governments -- cities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across the country. We know that the agency views this NPRM as one that is not economically significant. The reality, however, is that policy changes that affect who is considered a public charge will cause financial difficulty on the state and local agencies that administer the programs that would now be taken into account.  <br>If additional programs are included as factors in a public charge determination, these changes will impede participation by many in our communities, including eligible U.S. citizen children, and we expect families will opt out of these program. Moreover, the result in our communities will be detrimental including an uptick in hunger and uncompensated care and financially burden on our schools, child welfare agencies, public health systems, and hospitals. <br>On the legal side, this proposal is a grave affront to the U.S. constitutional rights of U.S. citizen children of immigrants. US citizen children may be deprived of these benefits because their parents would be subject to deportation or denial of an immigration benefit by taking advantage of them.  Not only does that raise hardship and policy considerations, it raises US Constitutional equal protection concerns. To put forth a proposed rule that attaches penalties to immigrant parents who apply for public benefits for their US citizen children is an attempted attack on the American family unit through alienage. Time and time again, this type of disparate treatment where the direct negative effect is to treat a subcategory of US Citizens differently has been struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Citizen children of immigrants would certainly bear this negative disparate impact if their immigrant parents are penalized per this proposed rule, if they apply for public benefits for their US citizen children. <br>In advance of the publication of this rule, I hope to speak with you or a designee to further discuss its impact. <br>Thank you in advance for your attention and response to this meeting request. <br>Sincerely, <br>William Peduto, Mayor <br>City of Pittsburgh <br>To find out more details regarding “Public Charge” please visit the links below. Both links were referenced in the press release. <br>[https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Public-Charge-Fact-Sheet-2018.pdf](https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Public-Charge-Fact-Sheet-2018.pdf)<br>[https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/fact-sheet/proposed-changes-to-public-charge-policies-for-immigrants-implications-for-health-coverage/](https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/fact-sheet/proposed-changes-to-public-charge-policies-for-immigrants-implications-for-health-coverage/)<br>**Contact:**<br>**Feyisola Alabi**<br>**Policy Analyst**<br>**Office of Mayor William Peduto**<br>**412-255-8680**<br>**feyisola.alabi@pittsburghpa.gov** | 19/4/2018 13:14:05 |

| City of Pittsburgh Hosts Two Globally Important Conferences This Week | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 23, 2018) Mayor William Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh are welcoming two world-leading conferences to the city this week: La Fabrique de la Cité and the p4 Conference. <br>The French think tank [La Fabrique de la Cité](https://www.thecityfactory.com/fabrique-de-la-cite/site/en/who-are-we.htm) is in the city today through Thursday to explore Pittsburgh's transition to a post-industrial economy and meet innovators in government, entrepreneurial and university sectors to study best practices in urban regeneration. <br>La Fabrique brings together French and international experts to study urban development and propose new ways to build and renovate cities. Its work revolves around five key topics: mobility, urban development and construction, energy, digital revolution, and new practices. Cecile Maisonneuve, chair of La Fabrique de la Cité, will be moderating discussions throughout the organization's three-day Urban Expedition in Pittsburgh. <br>It is only the second time the think tank has visited North America. <br>The latest [p4 conference](http://p4pittsburgh.org/) – a collaboration between the Heinz Endowments and the City of Pittsburgh – is Wednesday and Thursday.

| City of Pittsburgh Installs First Artistic Intersection in Carrick | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2419_Carrick_Artist_Designed_Intersection_4.jpg)PITTSBURGH, PA (April 24, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh has installed its first artistic design intersection at Brownsville Road and Parkfield Street in Carrick. The Carrick Artistic Intersection Project is a joint collaboration between Public Art and Civic Design Division (PA+CD) of the Department of City Planning, and the Department of Public Works.  <br>The intersection was initially envisioned and funded by the office of former District 4 City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak and completed under current Councilman Anthony Coghill. <br>When planning for traffic improvements at the intersection began Councilwoman Rudiak and her staff became interested in intersection enhancements such as an artist-designed crosswalk or artist-designed intersection markings. <br>As discussion continued with PA+CD and the Department of Public Works, it became increasingly important to garner community feedback about whether to pursue an artistic crosswalk or the artist-designed intersection markings. Community feedback was also needed in regard to the content of the design. <br>Community meetings were led by PA+CD to garner interest from local business owners and residents. Community participants were asked to identify their interests in regard to the identity of Carrick; their interests in regard to design aesthetics for the artwork; their interest in placemaking for this area of Carrick; and their thoughts regarding safety for this intersection. Additionally, the community was engaged in a discussion around which type of implementation to pursue and ultimately the artist-designed intersection was selected, rather than artist-designed crosswalks. <br>The community expressed safety as their number one interest for the implementation of this project. Some of the ideas that came up in regard to this were directional images or the use of muted colors. <br>In terms of the identity of Carrick, there were a few re-emerging themes that occurred. Ideas of a family-oriented neighborhood that offers affordable housing came up, along with amenities such as a business district and Phillips park. The school was also frequently mentioned, as well as the suggestion of using the name “Carrick” in the design, or “The Rock” which translates from Gaelic. Also noted was “Carrick-on-Suir,” which originates from Ireland and has the symbol of a swan. Additionally mentioned was the “Dairy District” in regard to this location. <br>When discussing aesthetics and placemaking related to design, the community was interested in evoking a sense of nature and residence through the use of houses, flowers, leaves, or trees. There was an interest in the design being colorful while also utilizing directional modes. Lastly, the community was hopeful that the intersection would become a conversation piece or reference point. <br>The PA+CD in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget released a Request for Proposals (RFP) with the selected artist being Guy Ruff. The artist used imagery of a swan as a symbol of love, fidelity, grace, and beauty to represent Carrick. He did this by using triangle shapes inspired by the actual shape of the intersection, and nature themes, with muted colors as requested by the community. <br>The intersection acts as a civic gateway while also enhancing the pedestrian level experience through the creation of a vibrant and engaging node.  Safety improvements were made by DPW  by installing a new traffic signal with pedestrian countdowns and the installation of a new high visibility crosswalk.  <br>(All photos Department of City Planning.

| Housing Authority Board to Weigh Construction Job Training and New Affordable Housing in Larimer/East Liberty | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 25, 2018) The board of the Housing Authority City of Pittsburgh, which is named by Mayor William Peduto, is set to vote on resolutions tomorrow to offer construction trades training for Housing Authority residents, and the spending of funds for mixed-income housing in the latest phase of the Larimer/East Liberty housing development. <br>The Housing Authority regularly seeks to boost employment opportunities to residents, and the board is set to vote on awarding contracts to Pittsburgh A. Philip Randolph Institute and Community Empowerment Association to provide construction trades training and job readiness training services to up to 40 residents. <br>Proposed are initial three-year, $100,000 contracts with CEA and the Randolph institute for 20 job training participants each. The HACP is proposing a performance funding mechanism that will reimburse the vendors based on enrollments, program attainments, graduations and job or advanced training placements by participants. Each contract has two one-year renewal options. <br>Larimer/East Liberty is in the midst of developing 334 units in multiple phases at the site. Phase I of 85 mixed-income units is under construction and the 150-unit Phase II is in predevelopment. Units are due to be completed by 2020. <br>Tomorrow's board action is to approve up to $692,000 in predevelopment activities for Phase III including site acquisition; design and implementation of public improvements and infrastructure; site and unit planning; and other activities to support approximately 45 units of mixed-income housing. | 25/4/2018 14:55:46 |
| Online Application for Pittsburgh-Area Homeless Wins Award | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 26, 2018) BigBurgh.com, a collaborative effort of several local service agencies recently taken over by the City of Pittsburgh, has been honored by the Allegheny County Children Roundtable with the "Champion for Children" award.  <br>[BigBurgh.com](https://www.bigburgh.com/app.html#/who) is an online application that directs youth and adults experiencing homelessness, or anyone in need, to free, low-barrier services in the City of Pittsburgh and greater Allegheny County. Designed for quick-and-easy use on your cell phone, BigBurgh has become an invaluable resource for police, teachers, clergy, medical and social services professionals, parents, and ordinary citizens alike. Most importantly, it’s for the homeless themselves – more than 60% of homeless youth have smartphones, and homeless adults frequently access computers at libraries and other centers. <br>BigBurgh began when Joe Lagana, Founder of the Homeless Children’s Education Fund, was speaking to Maurita Bryant, then Assistant Chief of the Pittsburgh Police, about the difficulty connecting individuals experiencing homelessness, especially youth, to resources. Joe then turned to Informing Design, a local firm specializing in untangling complex government systems, to answer the question, “could there be an app for that?” After 18 months of evaluation, and beta-testing with our Pittsburgh Police bicycle patrol officers, BigBurgh.com was created. <br>After almost two years of piloting, testing, and growth, BigBurgh was adopted by the City of Pittsburgh in January of this year, and will continue to be used by city first responders, and will also continue expansion to all of Allegheny County. <br>BigBurgh lists essential everyday needs, such as meals, shelter, clinics, showers and laundry, clothing and diapers, and expert help with financial, legal and employment matters, as well as essential emergency hotlines. List are shown based on the user’s location, and services are described in concise, jargon-free terms.  <br>“BigBurgh is a shining example of how a public-private partnership can work, all parties involved contributed in their area of expertise, and the result is a highly functional online resource that is easy and intuitive for the end user to navigate,” said BigBurgh Manager Sally Stadelman of the city's Public Safety Department. <br>With the Office of Innovation and Performance providing funding to sustain the technology, Public Safety has been able to utilize and promote its adoption to improve communication between outreach and the bureaus while ensuring that people experiencing homelessness have access to free resources.    <br>"BigBurgh is revolutionizing how we deliver services to our most vulnerable community members," said Assistant Chief Anna Kudrav. "We have a program here in Pittsburgh that is unlike anything anywhere else."   <br>BigBurgh’s great successes could not have been accomplished without the continued collaboration and support of its advisory council members: Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, The Allegheny County Department of Human Services Bureau of Homeless Services, United Way/PA 2-1-1 Southwest, Pittsburgh Mercy’s Operation Safety Net, The Pittsburgh Child Guidance Foundation, the Homeless Children’s Education Fund, and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  <br>"It's been shown time and again that one of the things that makes Pittsburgh special is the way many different partners can come together to make lives better for our residents, and especially those who are most in need," Mayor William Peduto said. <br>To qualify as a service to be listed on BigBurgh, services must be free, with a minimum of documentation. If you would like to suggest a potential listing on BigBurgh, or would like a BigBurgh presentation at your organization, please contact [sally.stadelman@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:sally.stadelman@pittsburghpa.gov) ( [bigburgh@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:bigburgh@pittsburghpa.gov)) or call 412-255-2239. | 26/4/2018 11:34:04 |

| Pittsburgh Joins Amended Complaint to Block Trump Administration from Demanding Citizenship Info in 2020 Census | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 1, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh has joined a bipartisan coalition of 18 states plus the District of Columbia, nine cities, four counties, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors in filing an amended lawsuit to block the Trump administration from demanding citizenship information in the 2020 decennial Census.<br>The lawsuit, which was originally filed last month in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, is led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. It was amended to add Colorado; Central Falls, RI (the site of the 2018 end-to-end test of the Census); Columbus, OH; Pittsburgh; Cameron County, TX; El Paso County, TX; Hidalgo County, TX; and Monterey County, CA as co-plaintiffs.  <br>The new co-plaintiffs join the Attorneys General of New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia; the cities of New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Providence, San Francisco, and Seattle; and the U.S. Conference of Mayors in the lawsuit. <br>According to the complaint immigrants account for approximately 8.5% of Pittsburgh’s population, and in 2014, approximately 18% of Pittsburgh’s immigrant population was undocumented.  <br>Demanding citizenship information on the Census would depress turnout in states with large immigrant populations, directly threatening those states’ fair representation in Congress and the Electoral College, as well as billions of dollars in critical federal funds. The amended complaint specifically highlights the billions of dollars at risk for states and localities around the country. <br>That includes approximately $10.3 million in in Community Development Block Grants funds Pittsburgh received in fiscal year 2016. <br>Moreover, the complaint highlights the extensive funding and resources plaintiffs have already dedicated toward encouraging participation in the 2020 Census, which did not account for the citizenship demand.  <br>The amended complaint also highlights recent comments by Census and other federal officials, such as Census Director Ron Jarmin’s remarks before Congress last month that he expected the negative impact of the citizenship demand on response rates to be “largely felt in various sub-groups, in immigrant populations, \[and\] Hispanic populations.” Jarmin went on to testify that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross disregarded the Census Bureau’s recommendation against including the citizenship demand. <br>[A copy of the complaint is available here.](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/85_first_amended_complaint.pdf)<br>On December 12, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice requested that the Census Bureau demand citizenship information in the 2020 Census form sent to every household in the United States, even though the Census is supposed to count all persons—citizens and non-citizens alike. Under the Constitution, the Census Bureau has an obligation to determine “the whole number of persons in each state.” Yet demanding citizenship information in the Census is expected to depress participation among immigrants, causing a population undercount that would disproportionately harm states and cities with large immigrant communities. Non-citizens are counted in the Census for the purposes of federal funds, apportioning of congressional seats and Electoral College votes, and the drawing of state and local districts. <br>The lawsuit was brought under the Enumeration Clause of the U.S. Constitution, as this action by the Trump administration will impede an “actual Enumeration” required by the Constitution. It is also brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, which permits courts to set aside unlawful or arbitrary and capricious agency decisions. <br>The [Census Bureau’s own research shows](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/486/564/1753930/) that the decision to demand citizenship information will “inevitably jeopardize the overall accuracy of the population count” by significantly deterring participation in immigrant communities, because of concerns about how the federal government will use citizenship information. These concerns are amplified by President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and pattern of actions that target immigrant communities. <br>In 1980, the Census Bureau [rejected the addition of a citizenship question](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/486/564/1753930/), saying, “Any effort to ascertain citizenship will inevitably jeopardize the overall accuracy of the population count. Obtaining the cooperation of a suspicious and fearful population would be impossible if the group being counted perceived any possibility of the information being used against them. Questions as to citizenship are particularly sensitive in minority communities and would inevitably trigger hostility, resentment, and refusal to cooperate.” <br>In 2009, all eight former Directors of the Census Bureau [dating back to 1979](http://reformimmigrationforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/thecensusproject.org_letters_cp-formerdirs-16oct2009.pdf) – who served under both Democratic and Republican presidents – affirmed that a citizenship question would depress participation and lead to a significant undercount, undermining the purpose of the Census itself. <br>As the lawsuit describes, the administration’s decision is inconsistent with the Census Bureau’s constitutional and statutory obligations, is unsupported by the stated justification, departs from decades of settled practice without reasoned explanation, and fails to consider the availability of alternative data that can effectively serve the federal government’s needs. The demand would also cause irreparable harm as a result of the hundreds of billions in federal funds that are tied to demographic information obtained through the Census. <br>The decennial census is also used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives, and each plaintiff state relies on population information from the Census Bureau to draw statewide redistricting plans for their Congressional and state legislative districts. Demanding citizenship information would cause disproportionate undercounts in communities with immigrant populations and therefore prevent plaintiff states from fulfilling the one-person, one-vote constitutional requirement, as well as create distributional inaccuracies in the data states use to draw district lines. Additionally, the citizenship demand would depress Census participation within the states’ diverse immigrant and undocumented populations, leading to inaccurate responses and a significant undercount of the states’ residents. As a result, an undercount of population in states that are home to large immigrant communities will impair fair representation, a principle fundamental to the fabric of our democracy. | 1/5/2018 10:58:10 |

| Ball-Nogues Studio Brings the Other Side of the World to Market Square | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 3, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh is pleased to welcome the internationally renowned [Ball-Nogues Studio](http://www.ball-nogues.com/) from Los Angeles to open the 2018 Market Square Public Art Installation “ [Other Side of the World](http://www.marketsquarepublicart.com/market-square-public-art-2018/).”<br>The artwork introduces Pittsburgh to Amsterdam Island, the nearly-opposite landmass from Pittsburgh if one could travel through the center of the earth to the other side. Comprised of a modular timber substructure, coated with desiccated rubber from recycled tires, and finished with a gradient of brightly colored rubber granules, the installation becomes a playful, vibrant, and physically accessible representation of Amsterdam Island that invites visitors to climb, explore, and experience the artwork.<br>"Other Side of the World” is free and open to the public, on view in Market Square through May 25, 2018. Throughout the course of the installation, there will be complementary programming and on-site interpretation for the artwork. All are welcome. Please visit [www.marketsquarepublicart.com](http://www.marketsquarepublicart.com/) for more information.<br>“Public Art is an essential tool for dialogue and building community. With this project the city intends to bring excellence in design and art to the citizens of Pittsburgh, and to bring people together to encourage exploration and discussion,” Mayor William Peduto said.<br>By encouraging viewers to reflect on the world’s vast geography, and consider the histories and stories of largely unknown places like Amsterdam Island, the "Other Side of the World" endeavors to spark curiosity, imagination, and new perspectives among Pittsburghers. Located in the South Indian Ocean, Amsterdam Island is one of the most remote places on the planet. The island's landscape includes an extinct volcano, craters, and vents amid the island’s coastal cliffs, grasslands, and shores. Amsterdam Island is now inhabited by only 25 French climate scientists who monitor CO2 concentration levels, study the impact of atmospheric contaminants, and observe the unique flora and fauna.<br>“We believe that ‘Other Side of the World’ is the perfect installation to kick off a season of free activities and events that enliven Market Square throughout the rest of the year,” said Jeremy Waldrup, President and CEO of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. “We are thrilled to have the world-class talent of Ball-Nogues Studio bringing such an interesting concept to Market Square.”<br>"Other Side of the World" is presented by the City of Pittsburgh. It was commissioned by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership with technical assistance and support from the Office of Public Art at the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council and partnership from the Public Art and Civic Design Division of the City of Pittsburgh. Additional technical assistance was provided by Flyspace Productions and Desmone Architects. <br>**About the City of Pittsburgh Public Art and Civic Design Division**<br>_This division promotes and ensures quality design of city-owned architecture, infrastructure, and landscape in order to create and enhance place-making by the inclusion of art and arts programming to reflect the city's history, diversity, and culture.

| More Free Sunscreen Dispensers Available in City Parks | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 3, 2018) The Department of Public Works is installing 15 additional free sunscreen dispensers at city park facilities this year, expanding the popular program first launched in 2015.  <br>The dispensers are filled with broad spectrum SPF-30 sunscreen and include instructions for proper use.  They will be installed over the next two weeks. <br>The new dispensers will be available at the following locations:    <br>- Vanucci spray park  <br>  <br>- Burgwin spray park  <br>  <br>- East Hills spray park  <br>  <br>- Mellon spray park  <br>  <br>- Cowley spray park   <br>  <br>- Warrington spray park   <br>  <br>- Arlington spray park   <br>  <br>- Paulson spray park   <br>  <br>- Banksville dek hockey court  <br>  <br>- Brookline dek hockey court  <br>  <br>- Marmaduke dek hockey court  <br>  <br>- Paul J. Sciullo II Memorial dek hockey court   <br>  <br>- Highland Park tennis courts  <br>  <br>- Frick Park clay tennis courts    <br>  <br>- Schenley Park Oval Sportsplex  <br>  <br>Existing dispensers will be replenished with a fresh supply of sunscreen at:  <br>- Schenley Oval restroom  <br>  <br>- Schenley Park between Anderson playground and pavilion  <br>  <br>- Frick Park between tennis courts and ballfield at concession stand  <br>  <br>- Frick Park at Blue Slide playground  <br>  <br>- Highland Park on path between pool and lake  <br>  <br>- Riverview Park at Activities Building playground  <br>  <br>- Brookline Center at the playground  <br>  <br>- Mellon Park at the playground  <br>  <br>Funding for the dispensers is provided by Sun Smart Pittsburgh, a 501(c)(3) organization promoting sun safety founded by Dr. Christie Regula and Dr. Justin Vujevich of Vujevich Dermatology Associates. <br>"Consistent sunscreen use is so important to prevent sun damage to the skin.  We are happy to partner with the city to provide this important public health service to the community,” Dr. Regula said.    <br>The dispenser program was founded by former City Councilman Dan Gilman in 2015 and was taken over by current District 8 Councilperson Erika Strassburger.  <br>“By increasing the number of free sunscreen dispensers available, we are creating a healthier and safer environment for Pittsburgh residents who play in our world-class parks every day. As someone who enjoys spending time in Pittsburgh's parks, I am particularly proud to have played a role in advancing this program to all corners of the city,” said Councilperson Strassburger. “I thank Dr. Regula, Sun Smart Pittsburgh, and our Department of Public Works for their work toward expanding this free service to our residents.”  <br>More than 8,500 Americans are diagnosed with skin cancer each day, making it the most common type of cancer in the United States. Experts say that applying sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor of 30 or higher can prevent the contraction of skin cancer.  <br>One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. Sun exposure in childhood and over a lifetime is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma.  Melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, is increasing at an alarming rate: it is estimated that one American dies of melanoma every hour. | 3/5/2018 14:43:01 |

| Pittsburgh's First Parking Space Parks Proposed Outside Allentown and Downtown Restaurants | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 7, 2018) Mayor William Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh are excited to announce the initial two applicants in the [2018 Spark Pilot Program](http://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/right-of-way/spark.html), which will create small street parks outside businesses in Downtown and Allentown. <br>A Spark is a small park or street park. It is a sidewalk extension creating a temporary, public seating area comprised of one to two parallel parking spaces. They are placed in commercial areas and intended to generate more on-street pedestrian activity supporting a healthy sidewalk culture and nearby businesses. <br>The pilot – a project of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure and the Department of City Planning – is part of Pittsburgh’s [overall strategy for creating safe, complete streets](http://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/planning-design/complete-streets.html) and new open spaces.  <br>"The streets and sidewalks around our neighborhood business districts are often untapped resources. The Spark program is a new way for all Pittsburghers to think creatively and re-use public space," Mayor Peduto said. <br>[![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2571_Spark_Twitter_02.jpg)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2571_Spark_Twitter_02.jpg)<br>The City is testing the program with two applicants before opening the program up citywide. The initial two applicants are [Bae Bae's Kitchen](https://www.baebaes.kitchen/) at 951 Liberty Avenue Downtown and [Onion Maiden](https://www.onionmaiden.com/) at 639 East Warrington Avenue in Allentown. <br>Resolutions approving both Sparks will be introduced to Pittsburgh City Council tomorrow. <br>Bae Bae's Kitchen is proposing building a small greenhouse with seating in a parking space in a short block of Liberty Avenue with dedicated 24-hour parking. The greenhouse will feature an integrated rain barrel for watering plants and feature movable tables and chairs. <br>Kitchen employees will maintain the greenhouse and the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership will store the structure in the winter. The location of the Spark compliments the PDP's Life on Liberty initiative, which seeks to prioritize pedestrian connections and safety, create dedicated transit amenities, reduce sidewalk congestion, and increase business opportunities in the area. <br>The PDP and adjacent business owners and residents filed letters of support for the Liberty Avenue Spark with DOMI. The estimated budget is $11,498 with installation slotted for next month. <br>In Allentown a steel and wood deck with seating is being proposed in a space in front of Onion Maiden and neighboring Skull Records. It has the support of the Hilltop Alliance, the Allentown CDC, the Allentown Business District Committee and adjacent property owners. <br>There is currently no outdoor seating or dining in the business district and stakeholders are hoping the Spark will help attract new customers to the corridor as well as provide an outdoor gathering space for local residents and the neighboring Allentown Senior Center.  <br>The estimated budget is $7,400 and it is planned to be installed next month. <br>Costs for the projects are covered by the applicants and their supporting organizations. <br>Sparks are public spaces, meaning that even though a particular business is the applicant, they are designed to be used by anyone, not only patrons of the sponsoring business.  <br>Other business districts, business owners, community groups and designers elsewhere around Pittsburgh are encouraged to re-think the way that their streets are occupied. Following the 2018 pilot year, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is designing a permanent Spark program, with applications for additional Spark projects planned to be available this summer. | 7/5/2018 11:17:50 |

| New Park with Green Infrastructure Planned for Larimer and East Liberty Neighborhoods | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 8, 2018) A new, 3.25 acre park called Liberty Green is set to be constructed in the Larimer/East Liberty Choice Neighborhoods development. <br>The board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh will consider an agreement this Thursday with the Richard King Mellon Foundation to provide $650,000 for the park at the corner of Larimer Avenue and Station Street in East Liberty.  <br>Liberty Green Park would be adjacent to the recently completed phase 1 85-unit Larimer/East Liberty Choice Neighborhoods mixed-income housing development, and the 150-unit phase 2 mixed income housing development underway.  <br>"Building this park is directly in line with the city's goal – outlined in the OnePgh plan – to provide parks or playgrounds within a 10 minute walk of every home in Pittsburgh," Mayor William Peduto said. "I want to thank the Richard King Mellon Foundation for this generous gift to city residents, which will help build one of the greenest parks in the country." <br>The new neighborhood park will feature a community plaza, open lawn and picnic areas, and dynamic playground elements.  Liberty Green Park will also feature significant green infrastructure with the capacity to manage up to 4 million gallons of stormwater annually. The green infrastructure will culminate in a community driven art exhibit, River Roots, that showcases innovative solutions for stormwater management and is a visible and functional celebration of a decade of Larimer citizens working together for a sustainable future.   <br>The City and the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh received a $30 million grant in 2014 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to implement the Larimer/East Liberty Choice Neighborhoods plan. <br>Choice Neighborhoods focuses on three core components: housing, people, and neighborhood. The URA is charged with implementing the neighborhood component, which seeks to address issues of vacant land, public infrastructure needs, and greening/park goals. <br>The URA led a robust public planning process in 2016 to develop a community wide vision for a proposed 25-acre park system in the Larimer and East Liberty neighborhoods, of which Liberty Green Park is the first phase. Outreach included 10 stakeholder and resident action team working sessions, three large neighborhood wide convenings, nine specialized workshops with youth and seniors, and a highly participatory park naming process. <br>The URA board is also set to vote Thursday to commit up to $1 million in local funds (including the foundation grant) to match a $1 million state RACP grant to pay for Liberty Green Park construction. <br>The URA expects to solicit bids for park construction next month. | 8/5/2018 15:31:48 |
| Gov. Wolf Announces Funding for Pittsburgh School and Sidewalk Safety Programs | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 8, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh was awarded more than $1.4 million in state transportation funding today in support of school and sidewalk safety initiatives championed by the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI). <br>The two initiatives were among 82 transportation projects approved for funding today [by Governor Tom Wolf and PennDOT Secretary Leslie S. Richards](https://www.governor.pa.gov/governor-wolf-82-improvement-projects-bolster-public-transit-communities-across-pennsylvania/) to enhance mobility and public accessibility statewide. <br>Pittsburgh received: <br>- $464,011 to hire a full-time Safe Routes to School coordinator to increase safe walking and bicycling opportunities for city students, purchase and distribute safety items (helmets, lights, reflectors); and expand the after school bike program. <br>  <br>- $980,000 to enhance pedestrian safety and access by constructing sidewalks within critical gaps throughout the city. <br>  <br>Sidewalks are the fundamental unit of mobility in any city and provide safe passage for pedestrians and other vulnerable users by providing a place to walk separated from vehicular traffic. Pittsburgh sidewalks are the responsibility of private property owners. This results in uneven improvement in the pedestrian network and periodic long delays in gaining compliance for a safe, traversable network for persons of all ages and abilities.  <br>The resources awarded by PennDOT will help the city act to address critical sidewalk gaps even while working with private owners. Critical gaps are typically those that connect communities to schools, transit stops, parks or recreational facilities or others.  <br>"The city is keenly interested in deploying these resources to neighborhoods of the city that have higher concentrations of residents who lack access to an automobile or other private means of travel," said DOMI Director Karina Ricks.  <br>Safe Routes to School is a program initially established in 2005 by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA-LU), a national funding bill. More than just building infrastructure improvements, the Safe Routes to School funding category offers programmatic support to establish policies, designs and educational programming to develop safer places and safer habits for students.  <br>"DOMI is pleased with the support from PennDOT to establish a Safe Routes to School program in the city and, we hope, eventually throughout the region," Director Ricks said. | 8/5/2018 15:07:04 |

| More Than 100 City Vacant Lots Adopted | [![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2589_Allegheny_Mountain_Lot_Photo.JPG)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2589_Allegheny_Mountain_Lot_Photo.JPG)<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (May 9, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh's "Adopt-A-Lot" program has reached a milestone, with more than 100 lots adopted since the program was launched in late 2015.<br>The Adopt-A-Lot program, developed as part of Department of City Planning's [Vacant Lot Toolkit](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/1760_VLTK_FINAL_10-28-15.pdf), was created in a collaborative process to allow residents a streamlined approach to accessing city-owned vacant lots for food, flower, or rain gardens. In an effort to productively use vacant city-owned lots, the program has three goals: foster neighborhood interaction, re-imagine the potential of vacant lots, and encourage environmental awareness.<br>In the first two years, 40 community projects have transformed a total of 114 vacant lots.<br>"The program is constantly evolving to adapt to what residents want,” noted Shelly Danko+Day, Open Space Specialist and Urban Agricultural and Food Policy Adviser at DCP, adding that there are hoop houses being installed on one project to extend the growing season, while another, initiated by a refugee community group, has adopted 35,000 square feet for a food and market stand garden, while others include neighborhood compositing projects.<br>A key goal of the program was to create more long-term access of city-owned lots for farming projects. Currently there are 23 projects in Adopt-A-Lot 3-year leases after completing their first successful year of stewardship. The success has prompted the URA to create a parallel program called "Farm-A-Lot" which will allow commercial farming projects on a subset of its property portfolio.<br>With better weather returning, residents and community groups interested in adopting city-owned vacant property should complete an intake form online at [http://pittsburghpa.gov/adopt-a-lot/intake-form.html](http://pittsburghpa.gov/adopt-a-lot/intake-form.html)<br>You can find the Vacant Lot Toolkit here [http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/1760\_VLTK\_FINAL\_10-28-15.pdf](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/1760_VLTK_FINAL_10-28-15.pdf)<br>For more information about the Adopt-A-Lot program, contact Shelly Danko+Day at 412.255.2287 or [shelly.dankoday@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:shelly.dankoday@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>(Photo: Allegheny Mountain Lot, Brighton Heights.

| City Council Approves Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan 3.0 | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 22, 2018) Pittsburgh City Council today voted to finally approve the city's [Climate Action Plan 3.0,](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/645_PCAP_3.0_Presentation.pdf) which commits Pittsburgh government to a series of climate change mitigation goals through 2030. <br>The goals include: <br>- 100% renewable energy use  <br>  <br>- 100% fossil fuel free fleet  <br>  <br>- Divestment from fossil fuel companies <br>  <br>- 50% energy & water use reduction  <br>  <br>- 50% transportation emission reduction <br>  <br>- Zero Waste <br>  <br>Working toward these goals aims to reduce Pittsburgh's greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2023, 50% by 2030, and 80% by 2050.<br>The draft 3.0 plan was introduced last year after more than 100 meetings, workshops, and events to help gather input and content. More than 300 people representing 90 different organizations, businesses, nonprofits, and government entities participated in writing the draft.  A public commenting period followed the release of the draft Climate Action Plan, including a public hearing hosted by City Council. Based on the feedback received during the public commenting period a few changes were made. In general, these changes included clarifying the goals set forth in the plan and expanding upon how community members and various stakeholders can get involved in the plan. <br>More hearings and public meetings followed, leading to Council's vote. <br>"Community engagement and the extended community process yielded additional support and insights that we will be using to create more community-climate connections and improved communications with community organizations," said Grant Ervin, the city's Chief Resilience Officer. | 22/5/2018 12:21:37 |
| Mayor Peduto Issues Letters of Support for State Legislation Assisting Workforce Development | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 22, 2018) Mayor William Peduto is expressing support for state legislation that will help workforce development in Pittsburgh and other cities by removing mandatory suspensions for non-driving citations and expunging records for non-violent, low-level convictions and non-convictions. <br>Suspended licenses make it more difficult for residents to travel to work, school and other essential destinations. Records on low-level offenders stay in public records for years, even if charges change or are dropped, and that information is often sold to employers. Changing state law in both matters would help many residents find work, rather than create barriers to employment. <br>Mayor Peduto wrote Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati and Speaker of the House Mike Turzai in favor of Senate Bill 529 and House Bill 1419, which are the "Clean Slate" bills on expunging records. <br>"HB 1419 and SB 529 are not simply issues of justice. For many cities struggling to increase rates of employment, we must begin to address the barriers that formerly incarcerated people face and ensure that they have greater access to employment. For Pittsburgh, we see removing these barriers as essential to increasing our workforce and lifting people out of vulnerability. It is notable that these bills are supported by the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, the Chamber of commerce for Greater Philadelphia, the Chester County Chamber of Business and Industry, and the Harrisburg Regional Chamber," the Mayor wrote. <br>The Mayor wrote the Senate Transportation Committee in support of House Bill 163, which would eliminate driver's license suspensions for drug-related crimes that are not related to vehicle usage. <br>"For those that have successfully served their time and are returning to society, we must remove any and all barriers to their success. Returning citizens who have difficulties getting a valid driver's license or identification card will also have difficulties getting stable housing and employment. Obtaining these things have proven to reduce recidivism and reliance on public assistance programs," he wrote. <br>Copies of the letters are available [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2747_Clean_Slate.pdf) and [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2748_HB_163.pdf). | 22/5/2018 09:44:19 |

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Uber Automated Vehicle Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 23, 2018) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement today regarding the announcement that Uber is ending its automated vehicle program in Phoenix following a fatal crash in March and planning to resume testing in Pittsburgh this summer: <br>"I made it clear to Uber officials after the Arizona crash that a full federal investigation had to be completed, with strong rules for keeping streets safe, before I would agree with the company to begin testing on Pittsburgh streets again. <br>In talks with company officials, I and the city's Department of Mobility and Infrastructure additionally required conditions with Uber before Pittsburgh would agree to testing. The conditions included that: <br>- Automated vehicles would never exceed 25 miles-per-hour in the city, on any street, regardless of legal speed limits. (The probability of pedestrians surviving a collision is much higher at speeds of under 25 mph. Even at 30 mph fatality rates increase dramatically.) <br>  <br>- The company use its driver app to alert human drivers when they are exceeding speed limits, so human drivers adhere to speed limits as well. <br>  <br>Uber did not tell me of today's announcement, and I was forced to learn about it through social media reports. This is not the way to rebuild a constructive working relationship with local government, especially when facing a public safety matter." | 23/5/2018 16:57:19 |

| Mayor William Peduto Signs Workforce Development and Labor Agreement Orders | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 29, 2018) Mayor William Peduto, in conjunction with the city's Construction Industry Task Force, today signed two Executive Orders supporting growth of the construction industry and access to family-supporting union jobs for city residents. <br>The Orders relate to project labor agreements (PLAs) and workforce partnerships.  <br>PLAs are employment agreements between contractors and labor organizations on construction projects. They provide access to a reliable supply of well-trained, highly-skilled workers and help projects get completed on-time and on-budget.  <br>In Pittsburgh they would apply to city-managed projects of $500,000 or more and be subject to oversight by a Project Labor Agreement Review Committee. Minority workers would comprise at least 12% on the workforce on such projects, and the projects would continue to be held to the city's minority and women-owned contracting goals of 18% and 7% respectively. <br>The workforce partnership order recognizes that minorities and women are underrepresented in the construction industry, and more efforts are needed to boost construction career opportunities in a time when the industry is in need of well-trained workers.  <br>The Construction Industry Task Force is already working on initiatives to bring more minorities and women into the apprenticeship and work site pipeline, and today's Order commits $350,000 for a Workforce Development Fund to support outreach and recruitment efforts including a pre-apprenticeship bridge program, online applications, website portals, and data sharing to track the initiative. The Pittsburgh Regional Building Trades Council has committed $100,000 and the City of Pittsburgh $250,000. <br>"We believe these two steps are raising the bar for city construction projects and building a pipeline to the worksite for people who have traditionally been excluded," Mayor Peduto said. <br>The Orders are the result of a year of work by Construction Industry Task Force partners including: City Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle and Corey O'Connor; Pittsburgh Trades Institute; Community Empowerment Association; A. Philip Randolph Association; Intro to the Trades at the Energy Innovation Center; Oxford Development; Pittsburgh Regional Building Trades Council; Builders Guild of Western PA; Partner4Work; and City of Pittsburgh departments. <br>Copies of the Orders are availalble here ( [Workforce](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2781_Workforce_Partnership_Executive_Order_-_Final.pdf)) and here ( [PLAs](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2785_Project_Labor_Agreement_Executive_Order_-_Final.pdf)). | 29/5/2018 08:39:09 |
| Building Benchmarking Deadline Approaching | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 29, 2018) Approved in October 2016, the Pittsburgh Building Benchmarking Ordinance requires owners of all non-residential buildings over 50,000 sq. ft. to track and report annual energy and water consumption data to the City. Buildings required to report must submit their data to the City by June 1, 2018.<br>Following this submission period, the City will prepare a report to contextualize this data and make it publicly available.<br>Building owners [were sent two notifications with the necessary information to comply](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1622). Additionally, three free trainings were offered to provide in-person guidance with the compliance process.<br>Buildings in Pittsburgh account for 81% of the City’s carbon emissions through the consumption of electricity and natural gas. Benchmarking gives building engineers, managers, owners, and tenants valuable information on how their buildings perform over time, as well as how they compare to peer buildings.<br>While the Building Benchmarking Ordinance does not require buildings owners to take any measures to reduce energy or water use, elsewhere the increased awareness of energy and water use brought about by benchmarking has been shown to result in a 4 to 7 percent reduction in utility use according to EPA.<br>The benchmarking data will help the city plan our next steps to meet our goals set forth in the new climate action plan.<br>More information about the ordinance, how to comply, and the list of buildings that must comply can be found at: [http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/programs/building-benchmarking](http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/programs/building-benchmarking/). | 29/5/2018 11:48:00 |

The use of the U.S. Communities contracts have demonstrated cost savings thereby stretching public tax dollars through best value public procurement.<br>The Pittsburgh procurement office is responsible for organizing and directing the day-to-day operations of government purchasing; managing the intergovernmental purchasing agreement with Allegheny County; driving improvements in procurement processes, policies, and technology; and implementing cost management initiatives related to procurement, warehousing, and inventory management.<br>It has initiated innovative transparency and procurement best practices during Mayor William Peduto's administration, including [OMB's purchasing website Beacon](http://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/index.html).<br>The city's procurement team is led by Jennifer Olzinger, and overseen by OMB Director Jennifer Presutti.<br>“I am so proud of the accomplishments made by the procurement team over the last few years. The City has realized increased efficiencies and professionalism in our procurement because of their hard work,” Presutti said.<br>Each year, U.S. Communities and its national co-sponsors recognize agencies from across the country who demonstrate leadership and dedication to procurement excellence. Earlier this year, U.S. Communities identified the City of Pittsburgh as a key enthusiast for innovative procurement practices via its continuous use of the U.S. Communities contract offerings which provide for greater economy and efficiency in purchasing.<br>As a result, U.S. Communities and its national co-sponsors selected the City of Pittsburgh to receive its Excellence in Procurement ward based on the city’s dedicated support to the principles of effective and efficient governmental purchasing principles. | 31/5/2018 14:25:03 |

| City of Pittsburgh To Participate In Ford's City of Tomorrow Challenge | PITTSBURG, PA (June 5, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh, Office of Mayor William Peduto is proud to announce the collaboration between, Department of Mobility and Infrastructure and Ford. Alongside jointly with public stakeholders and private partners Dell Technologies, Downtown Pittsburgh Partnership, and Microsoft to launch the “Pittsburgh City of Tomorrow Challenge,” a crowdsourcing platform for residents, businesses, and community groups to propose and pilot solutions that improve mobility in Pittsburgh.     <br>According to a United Nations report on world urbanization, 66 percent of the world’s population is projected to live in cities by 2050. As urban populations surge and new technologies take shape, the way people move around cities is changing, and the Pittsburgh of tomorrow will be very different from the Pittsburgh of the past – it will be green, accessible, sustainable and built around the needs of its people. The City of Tomorrow is Ford’s vision for the future that understands the need to make a continuous effort to implement solutions that address transportation challenges, such as crossing bridges, to enable people to get to work or spend more time connecting with friends and family.  <br>This is why Ford has created the City of Tomorrow Challenge – engaging communities around the mobility issues they care about most. The collaboration with Pittsburgh pairs the rich technology expertise of Ford and its partners with the real world experience and lived stories of Pittsburgh and its residents, creating an opportunity to propose ideas for how data, technology, and design might be put to use to address the city’s needs.  <br>“Nobody knows the Steel City better than its own hard-working businesses and community members, which is why we’re reaching out directly to them with the City of Tomorrow Challenge,” said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh mayor. “We want to give anyone who’s interested in  <br>their city a chance to be a part of finding real solutions to the issues they face every day – and to put those ideas to the test for everyone’s benefit.”  <br>Throughout the eight-month program, residents, businesses, and community organizations are invited to share how they experience transportation in Pittsburgh and how mobility either enables them or serves as a barrier to accessing the important aspects of their daily lives. Pittsburgh officials are also seeking ideas to better their city in a number of ways, including improving access to travel information, building confidence in existing systems, and soliciting ideas for improvements that can supplement existing services. To encourage people to take part and to test out the best ideas, the Challenge includes $100,000 to fund pilots that test the top ideas.  <br>"Pittsburgh is at the precipice of change, and we need to make sure the bright future we see is one where everyone can thrive,” said Karina Ricks, Pittsburgh director of mobility and infrastructure. “The City of Tomorrow Challenge will put deep analytical power and industry insight in service of the people of Pittsburgh, bringing forward innovative, real-world solutions to today's mobility challenges that help us achieve an inclusive tomorrow."  <br>By working with Pittsburgh communities to crowdsource new mobility designs and innovations, and funding pilots to test the top solutions, the Challenge program’s goal is to identify meaningful opportunities to create immediate impact for Pittsburgh residents and support long-term improvements to how people get around the city.  <br>“No two cities are the same – that’s why we’re committed to really understanding their specific issues and their needs,” said John Kwant, vice president, Ford City Solutions. “With the City of Tomorrow Challenge, our goal is to provide a program and access to technology that makes it easy for cities to engage residents, businesses, and other groups in a way that can lead to real solutions.”  <br>**How it works – and how you can get involved**<br>People can go to the Challenge website to share their experiences, sign up for community working sessions, and offer insight into the variety of ways people move around Pittsburgh today. Additionally, city staff will be out at a number of local neighborhood festivities and events to engage residents directly. On July 2, the application period will open, and participants can submit ideas for accessible solutions.  <br>In September, semi-finalists will be selected from among all submissions to attend a prototyping session and receive mentoring support to refine their ideas before submitting a final pilot proposal. During the Challenge’s concluding stage, $100,000 will be awarded to fund pilots to test the proposed strategy in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh, Ford, and the Challenge’s corporate partners.  <br>“We’re encouraging everyone to participate – from residents, community groups, and local businesses to universities and innovation centers across the U.S. and around the world – knowing the key to finding solutions and making a difference is widespread collaboration,” said Kwant. | 5/6/2018 12:36:02 |

| Pittsburgh Takes Leadership Role Among Cities Fighting Climate Change | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 8, 2018) In announcements at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Boston, Mayor William Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh are joining other cities in two key environmental initiatives regarding city energy consumption and science-based tracking of climate action plans. <br>Pittsburgh is joining with Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago and other cities in a joint purchasing initiative on energy announced Thursday by Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh.  <br>[Through the initiative](https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-walsh-calls-cities-join-large-scale-renewable-energy-initiative) cities will gather data on their energy needs and ask renewable energy developers for price estimates for projects that would meet their collective energy demand.  <br>The initiative is a natural next step for Pittsburgh, which through the Western Pennsylvania Energy Consortium aggregates the power consumption of 30 local governments and authorities. <br>"Working with other cities and pooling our purchasing power can help us be smarter – and more efficient – in how we both protect the environment and strengthen the economy. This will help governments nationwide and around Pittsburgh too," Mayor Peduto said. <br>The effort dovetails with the City's [Climate Action Plan 3.0,](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/645_PCAP_3.0_Presentation.pdf) which commits Pittsburgh government to a series of climate change mitigation goals through 2030, including a target of 100% renewable energy use. <br>"Our goal is to expand the consumption aggregation benefits of lower price and cleaner electricity for all consumers. We can do this through the generation of more local renewable power and the added benefits of creating local jobs and cleaner air," said the City's Chief Resilience Officer Grant Ervin. <br>Pittsburgh this week became the first American city to sign on to the Edmonton Agreement, which calls on cities of all sizes to use key performance indicators (KPIs) to scientifically track their efforts to comply with the goals of United Nations Paris Climate Accords.  <br>Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson [announced the declaration](http://www.iclei.org/details/article/edmonton-mayor-don-iveson-leads-new-call-to-climate-change-action-for-mayors.html) (available [in full here](https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Edmonton-Declaration-09.03.2018.pdf)) at the Change for Climate Global Mayors Summit in March, [which Mayor Peduto attended](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1550). <br>The declaration builds upon current efforts in Pittsburgh's Climate Action plan and several climate change mitigation partnerships with other cities. The City is a partner in other greenhouse gas measuring protocols through [ICLEI](http://www.iclei.org/), the [Carbon Disclosure Project](https://www.cdp.net/en) and the [American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy](http://aceee.org/).   <br>Mayor Peduto [is a board member of ICLEI USA](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1308). | 8/6/2018 11:49:14 |

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Cartoonist Rob Rogers | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 14, 2018) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement today after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette fired award-winning editorial cartoonist Rob Rogers: <br>"The move today by the leadership of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to fire Rob Rogers after he drew a series of cartoons critical of President Trump is disappointing, and sends the wrong message about press freedoms in a time when they are under siege. <br>This is precisely the time when the constitutionally-protected free press – including critics like Rob Rogers – should be celebrated and supported, and not fired for doing their jobs. This decision, just one day after the President of the United States said the news media is "Our Country's biggest enemy," sets a low standard in the 232-year history of the newspaper. <br>I've known Rob a long time. That has never stopped him from publishing cartoons that are critical of me, of my policy positions, or of my actions (or inactions) in office. He's even made fun of my weight. But he is one of the best in the world at his time-honored craft, and I know people of all political persuasions stand with me in support of him, even if the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette regrettably does not." | 14/6/2018 14:59:55 |

| Cool Globes Exhibit Debuts In Pittsburgh | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 18, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh is excited to announce the grand opening of Cool Globes in Pittsburgh.  The nearly 30 large globe sculptures - described as “public art with a purpose”- will be on display in Market Square, PPG Plaza, and Gateway Center through early October. Cool Globes: Hot Ideas for a Cooler Planet aims to raise awareness of and inspire viewers to take actions on climate change.  <br>“Cool Globes offers a message of hope and resiliency that is what Pittsburgh is all about," Mayor William Peduto said. ‎"I encourage everyone to visit the globes and learn more about what you can do to help combat climate change.” <br>Each globe features a message on how both the public and businesses can help reduce and mitigate climate change every day through actions such as increasing energy efficiency in homes and businesses, purchasing products made with 100-percent post-consumer material, increasing recycling and greening urban landscapes. <br>“The conversation that ‘Cool Globes’ enlivens is perfectly aligned with Pittsburgh’s growing role as a climate leader,” said Andrew McElwaine, vice-president of Sustainability for the Endowments. “Our individual and collective efforts have a massive impact on the sustainability of our planet, and this innovative exhibit helps spread that message in a creative, informative and fun way. The Heinz Endowments are pleased to help underwrite this important body of work.” <br>The Cool Globes Pittsburgh exhibit is made possible in part thanks to Heinz Endowments and PNC Foundation and will feature three new globes from local artists: Katy DeMent, Ashley Kyber, and Lindsay Wright.  <br>“The Cool Globes exhibit is internationally recognized not only for its artistry but also for shining a light on the environment,” said Greg Jordan, PNC general counsel, and chief administrative officer-. “The exhibit, and the globe we selected for installation at Triangle Park that represents green building, couldn’t be a more natural fit with PNC’s commitment to sustainability initiatives. We can think of no better place to showcase this exhibit and the work of local artists than our hometown.” <br>Cool Globes, Inc. was established as a 501(c)3 non-profit in 2006. The exhibit premiered in Chicago in 2007, in partnership with the Field Museum of Natural History and Mayor Daley’s Office of Environment, with more than three million viewers. The exhibit went on to travel the world, exhibiting in four continents, with plaques translated into nine languages. Pittsburgh will be Cool Globes 20th exhibition city.  <br>Cool Globes Founder, Wendy Abrams, explains, “It’s often difficult to talk about climate change in a positive light, given what is at stake. But this exhibit is about solutions and presents both hope and tangible actions.  It’s hard to use the words “fun” and “climate change” in the same sentence, but given the spectacular artwork of these artists, and the interactive nature of the exhibit, I think we’ve managed to do just that." <br>**The Heinz Endowments**<br>The Heinz Endowments seeks to help our region thrive as a whole and just community, and through that work to model solutions to major national and global challenges. The Endowments works to advance a sustainable future for our community and planet, successful learning outcomes for young people and their families, and a culture of engaged creativity for all citizens.

The foundation focuses its philanthropic mission on early childhood education and community and economic development, which includes the arts and culture. Through Grow Up Great, its signature cause that began in 2004, PNC has created a bilingual $350 million, multi-year initiative to help prepare children from birth to age 5 for success in school and life. | 18/6/2018 14:36:44 |

| PLI Launches Public Certificate of Occupancy Search | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 21, 2018) - The City of Pittsburgh Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections (PLI) has launched a Certificate of Occupancy search engine on their [website](http://pittsburghpa.gov/pli/occupancy/index.html). Certificates of Occupancy are documents that certify that a building or structure, or portion thereof, conforms to the applicable Zoning Code and Building Codes enforced at the time the Certificate was issued. The search tool will give residents, business owners, real estate agents and property owners the ability to determine the legal use of any building within the City limits. <br>A user can search by street address, parcel ID, permit number, and ward. PLI has also created a Search Guide that helps users understand the different ways Certificates have been indexed over the years. The search tool and guide are accessible by visiting [www.pittsburghpa.gov/pli/occupancy](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/pli/occupancy). <br>This effort is a result of leveraging existing technology to digitize hundreds of thousands of paper records spanning from the 1930s to present. Until 2016, a requestor was required to come downtown to PLI offices and ask an employee to make a copy of the record. <br>“Our Certificate of Occupancy search is a small but significant improvement in our business processes and speaks to our larger vision of transparent and open government. These records are public records and should be accessible to all.” said PLI Government and Public Relations Liaison Julie Asciolla. <br>Questions about the search or Certificates of Occupancy can be directed to [plirecords@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:plirecords@pittsburghpa.gov). Users are also encouraged to report any errors via email. | 21/6/2018 14:38:25 |

| City, County, and Partner4Work Kick Off 2018 Learn & Earn Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 26, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and Partner4Work today celebrated the start of the 2018 Learn & Earn summer youth employment program at the Best Buy Teen Tech Center.  <br>Now in its fourth year, Learn & Earn annually connects nearly 2,000 underserved Allegheny County and Pittsburgh residents, ages 14 through 21, with 6-week summer jobs in high-demand sectors. This year, 26 Learn & Earn providers paired young people with summer jobs at several hundred sites, where they will explore career options, develop valuable skills and gain work experience. Participants also receive 12 hours of work-readiness training, covering topics such as productivity, accountability, problem-solving and collaboration. <br>“We’re very proud of the success of this program, providing over 1,800 youth in our community with summer employment that provides them with work-readiness skills as well as a paycheck,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “Not only are youth given a summer job, but also an opportunity to explore a career in which they may be interested and to do work that is impactful for our community. The more that we can do to help our youth get ready for the workforce, the more prepared they will be to enter that workforce when the time comes.” <br>During the event, Learn & Earn participants, employed through PHASE 4 Learning Center, showed officials the technology they are using at the Best Buy Teen Tech Center. Those employed at other Learn & Earn sites will gain experience in positions as varied as a camp counselor to an office assistant. <br>“Learn & Earn is much more than an opportunity to earn a paycheck,” said Majestic Lane, Deputy Chief of Staff, City of Pittsburgh. “These jobs help young people build confidence, develop college- and work-readiness skills, such as time management, communications, and teamwork, learn from mentors, and dream big about their careers.” <br>This model summer youth employment program includes a highly selective Corporate Internship component. More than 15 area businesses are lending their support by hosting dozens of paid corporate interns, who will expand their career-readiness skills in high demand industries and occupations. During the summer, Learn & Earn will supplement the interns’ on-the-job experiences with 18 hours of training to learn about financial literacy, resume writing and interviewing, and networking techniques. The program also provides interns with opportunities to learn from guest speakers from the business community. <br>“We applaud Pittsburgh-area business leaders for supporting our region’s talent pipeline by participating in Learn & Earn’s Corporate Internship program,” said Debra L. Caplan, Chair, Learn & Earn Advisory Council and Partner4Work Youth Advisory Committee. “Learn & Earn brings together the public and private sectors to invest in our community’s young adults, opening doors to career pathways in Pittsburgh’s innovative, expanding economy.” <br>Learn & Earn is made possible through a partnership between Allegheny County, the City of Pittsburgh, and Partner4Work, with support from organizations such as The Pittsburgh Foundation, PNC Charitable Trusts, Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield and McAuley Ministries. A representative from Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield presented a $50,000 contribution to the Learn & Earn program during today’s kick-off event. <br>This summer’s Learn & Earn season runs through August 3. To learn more about Learn & Earn, visit [www.jobs4summer.org](http://www.jobs4summer.org/). <br>**About Partner4Work**<br>Nationally recognized for innovation, Partner4Work, formerly Three Rivers Workforce Investment Board, is the workforce development organization that connects funding, expertise and opportunities for employers, job seekers, agencies, and policymakers to develop a thriving workforce in the Pittsburgh area. As stewards of more than $21 million in public and private workforce funds, Partner4Work oversees and funds workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers and youth; educates the community through labor market analytics; and implements innovative solutions to the region’s systemic workforce challenges. More information is available at [www.partner4work.org](http://www.partner4work.org/). | 26/6/2018 15:48:08 |
| City of Pittsburgh Launches Resident Guides To Welcome Newcomers To The City | PITTSBURGH, PA ( June 26, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh is honored to celebrate the cultural diversity of the city during Immigrant Heritage month. The City additionally is proud to announce the launch of its first Resident Guide. The [Residents Guide](http://pittsburghpa.gov/resident-guides/guia-para-residentes-de-la-ciudad-de-pittsburgh/index.html) is an online resource that will offer Spanish-speaking residents helpful information about citywide services, resources, and function as a one-stop shop for residents needs.    <br>“This is a small step to make the city more accessible to all residents. We understand that knowledge is empowering; and by giving residents the tools and resources we aim to empower them and make this city an enjoyable and accommodating place for them, their families, and the greater community to live and thrive,” said Feyisola Alabi, Special Initiatives Manager.  <br>In 2017, one of the goals for the new City of Pittsburgh website was to create Resident Guides —  a page on the website containing important city information in one, accessible place and tailored to a community's specific needs. The Department of Innovation and Performance, Welcoming Pittsburgh, and the Commission on Human Relations came together to create the first guide tailored to the needs of the Hispanic/Latinx community.  <br>To ensure accuracy, relevance, and cultural appropriateness the team sought input from a diverse group of stakeholders in the Hispanic/Latinx community such as Casa San Jose, LACU, the Latino Community Center and Barrio Latino. After collecting all of the information, the city created an English guide that was then translated into Spanish by Nereida Daza of the Latino Community Center. <br>“Guides like this one will serve as bridges between our City and its residents. The Commission will always support efforts of this kind as a means to ensure that every person who lives, works or visits our city feels welcome, and has access to information and resources in a language that they can understand,” said Carlos Torres, Executive Director for the Commission on Human Relations.  <br>This is the first of several guides the city hopes to publish on the website, each curated for a different community in Pittsburgh and translated into different languages. As information changes, it is the city's goal to update the guides regularly. To learn more about the process and how we came to create these guides, click [here](https://medium.com/department-of-innovation-performance/city-of-pittsburgh-launches-resident-guides-to-welcome-newcomers-6ebabdf0d542).    <br>**Spanish translation:**<br>La ciudad de Pittsburgh lanza "Guías para Residentes" para recibir a nuevos habitantes de la ciudad. <br>(Lunes, 25 de Junio de 2018) En honor al Mes de la Herencia Inmigrante, y con objetivo de celebrar la diversidad cultural de nuestra ciudad, estamos orgullosos de lanzar la primera " [Guía para Residentes](http://pittsburghpa.gov/resident-guides/guia-para-residentes-de-la-ciudad-de-pittsburgh/index.html)", en español. Éstas guías son un recurso electrónico, con información útil acerca de servicios y recursos a través de la ciudad, y funcionan como una parada única para las necesidades de los residentes hispanohablantes. <br>"Éste es un pequeño paso de muchos, por medio de los que la ciudad busca hacerse más accesible a todos los residentes. Entendemos que el conocimiento empodera. Por ende, entre más sabe uno, más se está empoderado para usar las herramientas y recursos para hacer de la ciudad un lugar acogedor y agradable para usted, su familia, y su comunidad," expresó Feyisola Alabi, la gerente de Iniciativas Especiales para el programa "Welcoming Pittsburgh" <br>En 2017, uno de los objetivos para el nuevo sitio web de la ciudad de Pittsburgh fue crear "guías para residentes": información importante para los residentes de la ciudad ubicada en un solo lugar, y adecuada a las necesidades de comunidades específicas. El Departamento de Innovación y Rendimiento (Innovation and Performance, en inglés), la iniciativa "Welcoming Pittsburgh", y la Comisión de Relaciones Humanas se unieron para crear la primera guía orientada a las necesidades de la comunidad Hispana/Latina. Para asegurar exactitud y relevancia social y cultural, el equipo buscó el aporte de un diverso grupo de miembros de la comunidad Hispana/Latina, tales como: Casa San Jose, LACU, el "Latino Community Center", y Barrio Latino. Luego de recopilar la información, creamos una guía en inglés que fue traducida al español por Nereida Daza del "Latino Community Center". <br>"Guías como ésta servirán como puentes entre nuestra ciudad y sus residentes.

| Pittsburgh Explores Moving Civic Offices from Ross Street | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 12, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh and the Urban Redevelopment Authority are exploring moving city services from the John P. Robin Civic Building to a new Downtown location on the Boulevard of the Allies. <br>A new location at 420 Boulevard of the Allies would allow for efficient, one-stop shopping – with parking – for residents seeking services from the departments of Public Works, Permits, Licenses and Inspections, Planning and Zoning, and Mobility and Infrastructure. URA and Housing Authority of Pittsburgh offices would also be moved to the building. <br>The URA bought the Civic Building at 200 Ross Street from the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation in 1952 and it has not been updated in decades.  <br>"Years of disinvestment in this and other city facilities are crippling our efforts to give Pittsburgh residents the services they deserve. We need to look at a new location for these offices, while continuing ongoing upgrades to other buildings including public safety facilities, recreation and senior centers, and Public Works divisions," Mayor William Peduto said. <br>All of the major building systems in the 12-story structure need to be replaced, with issues including: <br>- No automatic sprinkler system <br>  <br>- No fire service access elevators <br>  <br>- No freight elevator <br>  <br>- Malfunctioning central heating system <br>  <br>- Malfunctioning cooling units <br>  <br>- Water infiltration into basement and elevator pits <br>  <br>City department and agency offices in the Civic Building are at maximum capacity, there is no additional storage space, and the floorplate of the 1907 building is outdated.  <br>It would cost an estimated $39.2 million to fully bring the building up to code and renovate its 12 floors of offices, while purchasing and renovating 420 Boulevard of the Allies would cost $38 million. The city could lease additional parts of the Boulevard building to bring in additional revenue. <br>If the Civic Building were renovated it would require multiple office moves, disruption in services to residents and businesses, and additional off-site office lease costs. Only one move would be required to the Boulevard building, into an energy efficient, ADA-accessible, and newly remodeled site with more amenities for residents and workers. <br>If ultimately approved by Pittsburgh City Council, the move to the new building could be completed in 2019. <br>The URA board is set to make an announcement today. No legislation has yet been forwarded to City Council. | 12/7/2018 13:57:36 |

Fourteen portraits will be highlighted in the display, depicting well known heroes like Sarumathi (Saru) Jayaraman, an Asian Indian American attorney, author, activist and the co-founder of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC-United) and Women and Youth Supporting Each Other (WYSE); and Grace Lee Boggs who fought for civil rights, labor rights, Black Power, feminism, Asian American rights, and the environment, or average AAPI residents who are politically active, like Resistance Auntie Anita Yavich or 20-month old JJ Kim who’s “WOKE” and participating during women’s march. <br>These individuals all showcase politically active AAPI heroes, encouraging all of us to make positive life choices and community change.  <br>The artist Jasmine Cho is founder and “creative ninja” of Yummyholic and champions cultural values and charitable giving. Through bake sales, donations and gallery art, Cho uses her hand-crafted treats to contribute to the community. The art is on loan from OCA Asian Pacific American Advocates, Pittsburgh Chapter. <br>The art exhibit will be available all month long in the City-County Building lobby." | 13/7/2018 12:19:58 |

| First Public Art Project Selected for Uptown | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 17, 2018)   The Public Art + Civic Design Division (PA+CD) and the Strategic Planning Division of the Department of City Planning are pleased to announce the selection of ProjectCONNECT, proposed by the collective HackPGH ( [https://hackpgh.org/](https://hackpgh.org/)), MetaMesh Wireless Communities ( [https://www.metamesh.org/](https://www.metamesh.org/)), and Artist Chiaka Zule Howze for a public art project in Uptown.<br>This is the first project of three public art interventions to be deployed in Uptown as part of the new Uptown Public Art Program. This Program was developed in collaboration with the Uptown community as an implementation project of the adopted Uptown / West Oakland EcoInnovation District Plan.<br>As part of the Comprehensive Plan, the Public Art Plan provides a vision for how public art will be created, maintained, and displayed in the City of Pittsburgh for the next decade and calls for the integration of art in the “built environment” as an element of urban and building design and as a means of reinforcing public gathering places, infrastructure, neighborhoods, and communities. <br>This public art project and others are happening in cooperation with city neighborhoods and advocates, and the City of Pittsburgh is committed to planning, public art and communication with its community partners.<br>On February 2, 2018, the Office of Management and Budget released a Request for Proposals to solicit artists, artist collectives, designers, and educational and arts institutions to create public art for the City of Pittsburgh’s Tustin Park in the Uptown area.<br>An Advisory Committee was created to help the City shortlist proposals; this committee included City staff, business owners or stakeholders of the area, residents, and two visual artists. The final selection was made by a City Committee who evaluated the projects under a scoring system that took into consideration the project's creativity, innovation, aesthetics, public value, and integration to the site as well as other components from the EcoInnovation District Plan such as potential for equity, identity, connectivity, and performance.<br>ProjectCONNECT is a multi-phased intervention that proposes the creation of an innovative utilitarian public art project -- a solar-powered charging station bench that provides residents and the surrounding area of Tustin Park with free WiFi. Artistic elements such as a mural and markings that represent the history, equality, and united community voice of Uptown tie the project together as a whole.  In addition, a small demonstration stormwater project is part of the intervention.<br>In the following months the PA+CD and the community will be working with this collective to refine their proposal and bring the project to fruition.<br>Contacts:<br>Yesica Guerra<br>Public Art and Civic Design Manager<br>City of Pittsburgh<br>Department of City Planning<br>200 Ross St. 4th floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15219<br>\[p\] 412.255.8996<br>\[e\] yesica.guerra@pittsburghpa.gov<br>Anthony Cavalline<br>Arts, Culture, and History Specialist<br>City of Pittsburgh<br>Department of City Planning<br>200 Ross St., 4th Floor Pittsburgh, PA 15219<br>\[p\] 412.255.8996           <br>\[e\] anthony.cavalline@pittsburgh.gov | 17/7/2018 14:59:07 |

| City Releases Pittsburgh Equity Indicators Report: A Baseline Measurement for Enhancing Equity in Pittsburgh | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 18, 2018) As part of the ONEPGH Resilience Strategy, the City of Pittsburgh has released the first annual report of the Pittsburgh Equity Indicators, a set of 80 measures that report disparities by race, gender, or income in four domains: Health, Food, and Safety; Education, Workforce Development and Entrepreneurship; Housing, Transportation, Infrastructure and Environment; and Civic Engagement and Communications. The report pinpoints the problem areas in which Pittsburgh’s residents of different races, genders and incomes experience vastly different health, social, and economic outcomes and access to resources and opportunities.<br>“Ensuring equity for all is one of the City's greatest priorities, and we are taking a data-driven approach to identify where the inequality is most pronounced, and then invest in eliminating it,” said Mayor William Peduto. “We’ll be working with the Forbes Funds to use the Equity Indicators report and do independent third party evaluations to ensure that we and our partners are delivering services effectively and equitably city-wide.”<br>The [Department of City Planning](http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/) and the [RAND Corporation](http://www.rand.org/) developed this tool in partnership with the [CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance](https://owa16.cuny.edu/owa/islg.cuny.edu) and [100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation](http://www.100resilientcities.org/ "http://www.100resilientcities.org/ Cmd+Click or tap to follow the link") (100RC). ISLG developed a pilot [Equality Indicators tool](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__equalityindicators.org_&d=DwMGaQ&c=mRWFL96tuqj9V0Jjj4h40ddo0XsmttALwKjAEOCyUjY&r=uVR05YeGV6H3cWhfbmF0NZHCVx-Am_dSxpdwWEoiSUA&m=Jn72jvPxhSVGyigh784FVNlw235C4xSzmiecyWT_1OY&s=GCAo1aH6kSvaOv43zEvyQTBy4qWGYPpfgWiqj4lfr9w&e=) for New York City, which has measured the city’s progress toward greater equality for the past three years across several areas including economy, education, health, housing, justice, and services. Pittsburgh was [one of five cities selected](http://islg.cuny.edu/sites/2017/06/07/equality-indicators-expands-to-five-cities-across-the-country/) to participate in this initiative after submitting an application stating its commitment and describing its efforts thus far to improve equality or equity across the city. Principle among these is [ONEPGH](http://pittsburghpa.gov/onepgh/documents/pgh_resilience_strategy.pdf), Pittsburgh’s citywide Resilience Strategy, which dedicates about one-quarter of its initiatives to creating equal opportunity for all residents.<br>“Just over a year ago, the City of Pittsburgh made a commitment through ONEPGH, the city’s Resilience Strategy, to address persistent inequality as a core resilience challenge,” said Otis Rolley, Managing Director for North America at 100 Resilient Cities. “Through today’s Equity Indicators release, Pittsburgh now has a concrete tool to help achieve that goal. 100RC is proud to support the city as it works to advance equity and thus build a more resilient city for all.”<br>Pittsburgh’s first comprehensive snapshot of inequity based on CUNY ISLG Equality Indicators methodology highlights that the city’s population experiences some significant disparities, measured in terms of access to resources and opportunities as well as in outcomes. This summary shows that the gap between black and white residents (or between other comparison groups) is particularly evident in health and public safety, housing affordability and stability, income and poverty, and infrastructure quality and neighborhood composition, all of which have been identified as high priority areas for additional investment by City and regional policymakers and stakeholders. The summary also reveals that the City is doing comparatively better in terms of equal access to transportation and civic engagement opportunities. However, it could be argued that the rates of access or participation for all city residents are nevertheless too low in these sectors, which would still demand further investment.<br>ISLG Executive Director Michael Jacobson said, “The Equity Indicators tool developed by the City of Pittsburgh and RAND Corporation will enable the development of more data-driven policy aimed at addressing systemic inequities in Pittsburgh. The tool builds on the City’s ONEPGH Resilience Strategy by transparently measuring the City’s progress toward achieving more equitable outcomes for its residents.” <br>Overall, Pittsburgh’s 2017 indicators paint a picture of a city with substantial room for improvement. These indicators, and the underlying metrics and data sources used to support them, will serve as a tool to track the city’s progress over time towards improved opportunities and outcomes for all city residents. Additionally, this process will be repeated using 2018 data to evaluate year to year changes. The City will be working with 100RC and CUNY ISLG this fall to host workshops with key stakeholders to dig into the most troubling indicators and identify opportunities for action.<br>The City’s [Bureau of Neighborhood Empowerment](http://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/mayor.html) and [Division of Sustainability and Resilience](http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/sustainability-resilience/index.html) will be using the Equity Indicators report to evaluate City programs and services, and leverage the City’s Capital and Operating Budgets as well as a [new social investment fund](https://www.nextpittsburgh.com/latest-news/new-social-investment-fund-pittsburgh-calls-3-billion-improving-city/) to ensure that opportunity is accessible for all residents. Working with the Forbes Fund, this evaluation will be extended city-wide.<br>Read [the full Pittsburgh Equity Indicators report here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/3171_PGH_Equity_Indicators_Final.pdf).<br>**RAND Corporation**<br>The RAND Corporation is a non-profit, non-partisan research organization.

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on UPMC Mercy Vision and Rehabilitation Hospital | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 25, 2018) Mayor William Peduto today issued the following statement in favor of plans for a new UPMC Mercy Vision and Rehabilitation Hospital in the city's Uptown area: <br>"I support plans for the new Mercy Vision and Rehabilitation Hospital because of the world-class and unparalleled vision and therapeutic services it will provide critically ill patients, and the transformative effect it will have on Uptown and the Hill District.  <br>Construction of the new hospital will anchor the EcoInnovation corridor through Downtown, Uptown, the Hill and Oakland, and is supported by community-based equitable development plans for the area. Led by Uptown Partners, community leaders and residents of the Uptown community have worked diligently on the plans, shaped them with UPMC to meet their needs and decided to back the construction, and so do I. <br>Construction and operation of the hospital will also create good union jobs for local residents. As the Pittsburgh economy evolves it is imperative that it be an economy for all, and I will make sure that UPMC lives up to its commitments in this project to recruit local residents for jobs there. I am a longtime and proven supporter of union and worker rights, and I continue to stand in support of organized labor's fights for its members, particularly in a time when strong federal forces are mounting against them. <br>I am further encouraged by the additional services for at-risk populations, such as those experiencing homelessness, which UPMC Mercy will provide with the construction of this hospital. UPMC has long supported Mercy Hospital's mission of helping those in need in Uptown and the greater Pittsburgh community and continued to invest in the institution despite ongoing budget pressures. The new hospital will cement the long-term presence of Mercy in the community. <br>I look forward to working alongside City Council on efforts to approve plans for the Vision and Rehabilitation Hospital, and to deliver on years of work on the community-based rebirth of Uptown and the Hill District." | 25/7/2018 13:45:23 |

All submissions were scored by a panel of City representatives, based on the criteria given in the call such integrating themes of health, play, active learning, or neighborhood identity, and carefully selected to reflect the feasibility of their execution, the selected locations, and budgetary constraints.<br>Nine artists were selected to implement their designs. Artworks will begin to be installed in early August, with most projects being fully installed by the end of summer.<br>The selected artists are:<br>Genevieve Barbee-Turner – Schenley Park/p1<br>Nicole Reading – Schenley Park/p1<br>Saige Baxter – Frick Park/p2<br>Randi Stewart – Frick Park/p2<br>Maureen Walsh – Mellon Park/p3<br>Ben Grubb – Highland Park/p4<br>Ramiro Davaro-Comas – Riverview Park/p5<br>Sandy Kessler & Linda Wallen – Riverview Park/p5<br>Lori Hepner – Emerald View Park/p6<br>This call hopes to support the work of artists while building on Pittsburgh’s creative and artistic heritage. Public Art is a tool that can enhance the built environment, reinforce neighborhood character, unify and activate spaces, and create landmarks, as well as generate dialogue and promote better understanding of current issues. Therefore, as Pittsburgh builds its present and envisions for its future, the City is committed to Public Art being an integral component of Pittsburghers’ way of life.<br>Contact:<br>Yesica Guerra<br>Public Art and Civic Design Manager<br>City of Pittsburgh<br>Department of City Planning<br>200 Ross St. 4th floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15219<br>\[p\] 412.255.8996<br>\[e\] yesica.guerra@pittsburghpa.gov<br>Anthony Cavalline<br>Arts, Culture, and History Specialist<br>City of Pittsburgh<br>Department of City Planning<br>200 Ross St., 4th Floor Pittsburgh, PA 15219<br>\[p\] 412.255.8996<br>\[e\] anthony.cavalline@pittsburghpa.gov | 31/7/2018 10:50:23 |

| Peduto Administration Lodges Opposition to Federal Family Planning Rule | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 1, 2018) Mayor William Peduto today lodged his opposition to a proposed rule change by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would drastically restrict access to reproductive health care.<br>The Trump Administration is proposing changes to the Title X Family Planning Program, which has provided vital sexual and reproductive health services to people across the state of Pennsylvania for more than 40 years.<br>"This proposed rule is a blatant attack on reproductive health focused providers like Planned Parenthood that provides both men and women access to safe and quality healthcare. Annually in Pittsburgh and surrounding counties, the Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania serves more than 28,000 people by providing access to affordable reproductive and sexual health care services. Unduly restricting these healthcare providers that serve vulnerable populations is irresponsible and shameful," Mayor Peduto wrote.<br>A copy of [his letter to HHS is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/3410_Peduto_letter_073118.pdf). | 1/8/2018 10:08:03 |

| City of Pittsburgh Celebrates National Farmers Market Week | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 3, 2018) The City Of Pittsburgh joins cities across the country in celebrating National Farmers Market Week from August 5-11. The celebration kick-off will take place on Sunday, August 5th, 10:00 a.m., at the Squirrel Hill farmers market where Councilman Corey O’Connor will present a proclamation from Mayor William Peduto to market managers across the city.  <br>Pittsburgh has had continuous, weekly farmers markets since 1942 when the Farmers Market Cooperative of East Liberty first purchased their building and created a coop to bring fresh food into the city. Currently, Pittsburgh is home to 25 markets, with hundreds of regional farmers and vendors selling a wide variety of local products, including fruit, vegetables, cheese, meat, bread, coffee, tea, milk, sauces, pickles and marinades, hummus, pasta, and more. <br>As demand for local food continues to grow, so too have the opportunities for America’s farmers to market fresh food directly to the consumer. According to statistics recently released by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), farmers markets and farm stands account for roughly $2 billion of the $3 billion that Americans spend annually on farm-direct products. This revenue, in turn, supports the livelihoods of more than 165,000 mostly small and mid-sized farms and ranches.  <br>"We realize that to be a resilient city, we must have a sustainable local food system. Farmers markets are central to creating the urban-rural connections that are key to that system,” said Mayor William Peduto. “Farmers Markets support Southwestern PA’s small farms, circulate money back into our local economy, while increasing access to healthy foods for our residents. We're fortunate to have such a strong farmers market network in the Pittsburgh area." <br>Farmers and ranchers receive only 15 cents of every food dollar that consumers spend at traditional food outlets. At a farmers market, 100% of your food dollar goes to your local farmer.  <br>“Farmers markets play a vital role not just in generating real income for farmers, but in forming a healthy, prosperous food system,” says Jen Cheek, Executive Director of the [Farmers Market Coalition.](http://www.farmersmarketcoalition.org/) “By providing the opportunity for farmers to connect directly with consumers, markets serve as education centers. Vendors are teaching customers about agriculture and sharing recipes and new foods with their neighbors. Markets are making people and communities stronger and healthier. “ <br>All farmers’ markets accept food stamps (SNAP), credit and debit cards as part of Just Harvest’s Fresh Access program.  For every $5 spent in food stamps, receive an extra $2 to spend on produce. <br>For a directory of all the farmers’ markets that serve the residents of Pittsburgh, with dates, time, and details for each of the markets, please check out [https://farmspread.com/pittsburgh-area/](https://farmspread.com/pittsburgh-area/)<br>For more information, please, reach out to, Shelly Danko+Day [Shelly.dankoday@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:Shelly.dankoday@pittsburghpa.gov). <br>**Celebration Details**<br>**Location:** SQUIRREL HILL - Beacon/Bartlett parking lot <br>**Time:** 10:00 a.m. | 2/8/2018 12:11:55 |

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Representative Turzai Calls for PWSA Privatization | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 9, 2018) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement today on comments by Representative Mike Turzai on privatization of the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority: <br>“With bizarre comments like these, you have to wonder why any entity would want to do business with the city. It‘s imperative that the people of Pittsburgh have trust that all PWSA matters are subject to a completely transparent process yet the Representative is infatuated with forcing through its privatization. <br>I’ve been crystal clear that this asset remain the property of the people of Pittsburgh, and unlike the Representative I don’t respond to issues with emotion, but with data. The latest testing shows the lowest PSWA lead levels in years, state regulators have approved introducing orthophosphates into its lines, and soon a 12-year plan will outlay strategic improvements to the system. Once that data-driven work is done we will logically evaluate if any third-party could help us address the authority’s issues – it won’t be at the whim of someone who doesn’t represent the city residents who own the water system.” | 9/8/2018 13:27:01 |

| Mayor William Peduto to Honor Bill Strickland with Key to the City | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 10, 2018) Mayor William Peduto will present Bill Strickland, Founder and Executive Chairman of Manchester Bidwell Corporation (MBC), with the Key to the City today at 1 p.m. at the Mayor's Conference Room in the City-County Building.<br>Strickland is currently celebrating half a century of making people whole through MBC’s innovative programs — Bidwell Training Center (BTC), MCG Youth & Arts, MCG Jazz, National Center for Arts and Technology (NCAT), and Drew Mathieson Center for Horticultural and Agricultural Technology (DMC) — which all operate under the same guiding principles: environment shapes behavior, people are assets not liabilities, and creativity fuels enterprise.<br>"Bill Strickland is a model public servant who has transformed the lives of countless Pittsburgh residents, and inspired generations of us to be better versions of ourselves. Our city wouldn't be the same without him," Mayor Peduto said.<br>Strickland’s community impact began in 1968 at 19 years old. He established Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild (MCG) as a way to serve his neighborhood following the chaos and violence that emerged after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination by providing arts education to children in Manchester.<br>When Strickland assumed the leadership of BTC in 1972 he established the innovative approach of partnering with industry to provide career training for fields that are in demand, which today include medical assistant, laboratory technician, pharmacy technician, culinary arts, and horticulture technology among others, and all at no cost to qualifying students.<br>In addition to MCG and BTC, Strickland has brought iconic jazz legends to Pittsburgh’s North Side and championed Pittsburgh’s jazz artists and jazz history across the world through the GRAMMY Award-winning MCG Jazz program. The North Side has also been exposed to the natural beauty of orchids and other floriculture and agriculture at the DMC’s 40,000-sq.-ft. greenhouse.<br>For 50 years Strickland has not only presided over MBC but has changed the lives of tens of thousands of people in Pittsburgh and around the world. Accolades and successes include: 98 percent of MCG Youth & Arts students graduating high school on time; two consecutive ACCSC School of Excellence recognitions in 2012 and 2017 for BTC; and three GRAMMY Awards and two Latin GRAMMY Awards for MCG Jazz label recordings.<br>This success in Pittsburgh has led MBC to launch 11 other centers around the world: Boston; Brockway, Pa.; Buffalo; Chicago; Cincinnati; Cleveland; Grand Rapids, Mich.; New Haven, Conn.; San Francisco; Sharon, Pa.; and Akko, Israel with more centers signed on to open in other cities.<br>“I am humbled and honored to receive the key to the city, and I thank Mayor Peduto for this recognition” said Strickland. “I travel the world now to open more centers that will provide pathways out of poverty, and to point to our original center in my great city of Pittsburgh as a model for the globe always fills me with great pride.”<br>**About Manchester Bidwell Corporation**<br>At Manchester Bidwell Corporation, we have a simple philosophy: Environment shapes people’s behavior. By constructing an atmosphere of art, light, music, and supportive staff, we enable our students to become productive members of society. Entering our 50th anniversary, we are celebrating half a century of making people whole. We do this throughout our family of affiliates that include Bidwell Training Center, MCG Youth & Arts, MCG Jazz, the National Center for Arts and Technology, and the Drew Mathieson Center.

| City Seeks Residents to Join Newly-Formed Public Engagement Working Group | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 13, 2018) Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning (DCP) is creating a Public Engagement Working Group to review and renew the approach to public participation in the City’s planning process. The key focus of this group’s work will be to help DCP create a Public Participation Plan for the City’s Comprehensive Plan initiative.  Engagement is key to the next phase of completing the Comprehensive Plan, which will shape policy and practice for the City’s sustainable growth, in coordination with major planning initiatives including the ONEPGH Resilience Strategy and the People, Planet, Place, and Performance (p4) Principles, and building on public engagement and guidance. <br>It is crucial that residents help to create strategies that will best engage, educate, and utilize public feedback into the Comprehensive Plan and other long-range planning process. To do this, DCP is inviting residents with an interest in and desire to influence how these efforts do so by being a part of the Public Engagement Working Group. The commitment is expected to last from September through December of this year (see below for details).<br>The Public Participation Plan created from this work is intended to outline the framework for how the City conducts engagement efforts throughout the next phases of the Comprehensive Planning process, and will also establish guidelines for improving the approach to engagement more broadly.  This Public Engagement Working Group will build on a multitude of efforts by the City and Civic sector to improve public engagement, including the Deliberative Democracy approach, neighborhood planning, and equity and sustainability initiatives, which have worked to encourage and achieve active participation across a broad and diverse cross section of the Pittsburgh community.<br>The Working Group’s tasks will include reviewing these tools as well as national best practices, and looking at specific avenues for improvement, from public hearings to workshops and training.<br>The City will work with the Working Group to establish the framework and principles for the Public Engagement Plan, learning from local practices and emerging paradigms for engagement. The Public Engagement planning process will include three key meetings and one public panel that focuses on best practices and innovation for public engagement.<br>Working Group members will attend four events, including a Public Participation Panel and three Working Group meetings. The **_Public Participation Panel_** is scheduled for **_Thursday, September 13, 2018_** at the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh from 6-8:30 p.m. This event will be open to the public. The Working Group Meetings will occur on the following dates from 6-8 pm: Wednesday, October 10, 2018; Wednesday, November 7, 2018; and Wednesday, December 5, 2018.<br>To learn more about the Working Group & to apply please visit our [website](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/projects/CompPlanPGH/) and [application](https://arcg.is/11XTTn).<br>The application will be available until Sunday, August 26th, 2018 at midnight.

| Mayor William Peduto Reopens Investigation into City Home Sale | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 15, 2018) Mayor William Peduto has asked the Office of Municipal Investigations to reopen its inquiry into the sale of a vacant city-owned home to the city’s real estate manager. <br>The home on Tropical Avenue in Beechview was vacant and tax delinquent from 2009-2016 and was offered at Treasurer’s Sale in 2015. No buyers came forward. The following year the city’s real estate manager – an employee in the city’s Finance Department – bid $2,500 to buy the house, and the purchase was approved by City Council. <br>After news reports on the sale this June OMI opened an investigation into the matter. The inquiry was closed, as there are no city policies or guidelines prohibiting city employees from buying city real estate. <br>However, a news report this month found there was another 2017 bidder on the property, raising the question whether there should have been a competitive auction to purchase it. That report spurred Mayor Peduto to call for the OMI inquiry to be reopened. <br>The investigation is expected to study if the sales price of the home was appropriately valued; if the purchaser was qualified under the normal course of business; if the sale was properly advertised; and if the normal sales process was followed.  <br>Mayor Peduto has also asked the Director of Finance to work with the Law Department to review current policies involved with the sale of real estate. | 15/8/2018 13:45:32 |

| Pittsburgh's Chief Financial Officer and Budget Director Leaving for New Opportunities | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 21, 2018) Sam Ashbaugh, the city’s Chief Financial Officer, and Jennifer Presutti, the director of the city’s Office of Management and Budget, are leaving city government next month to take new positions. <br>Mayor William Peduto appointed Ashbaugh in May 2014 as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Formerly working at the consulting firm Deloitte as well as at the Government Finance Officers Association in Chicago, Ashbaugh was among the final hires through the city’s foundation-backed Talent City process, which searched nationally for the best recruits for top city government positions. Ashbaugh was elevated to Chief Financial Officer in 2017.  <br>Presutti joined the city in 2010 and Mayor Peduto promoted her to OMB Director in 2017. She has served as a budget analyst, senior budget analyst, capital budget manager, assistant director- capital and asset management, and finally director.  <br>“The problem with hiring good people is others are going to try to hire them too,” Mayor Peduto said. “This is the kind of turnover that happens naturally in a second term, especially with public servants of this magnitude.” <br>“I and other Pittsburgh taxpayers owe Sam a lot of thanks – he instituted truth-in-budgeting to the city for the first time, focused on implementing leading practices, oversaw the implementation of new technology across all of the City’s financial operations, saw us out of Act 47 oversight, and placed budget reforms into city law that will further strengthen our finances for years to come.” <br>Presutti is becoming budget director of the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority.  <br>“Jen helped see us out of financially distressed status, and took on the great challenges facing upgrades to facilities citywide, which has long been one of our most vexing long-term financial issues,” the Mayor said. “She has cultivated a great OMB staff that will continue to provide strong budgetary oversight into 2019 and beyond. In her new role, Jen is exactly who the city needs to help guide the continuing restructuring of the PWSA. ” <br>Ashbaugh is taking a position as Executive Director, Finance at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. <br>“After starting my professional career as a budget analyst in OMB back in 1997, I was honored when Mayor Peduto had the confidence in my abilities to name me as Director of OMB in 2014 and have my career come full circle. We have made significant progress to strengthen the City’s finances and transform the delivery of core internal and citizen-facing services, but none of this would have been possible without the many talented and hard-working city employees with whom I’ve had the pleasure of working with over the last four-plus years,” Ashbaugh said. <br>“I am proud to serve the people of Pittsburgh, I am proud to work alongside such talented individuals, and I am honored to work with the Mayor and his administration,” said Presutti.  <br>Both Ashbaugh and Presutti are leaving city government on Friday, September 14. Announcements on acting directors of OMB and Innovation and Performance (where Ashbaugh is serving as interim director) will be made in coming weeks. <br>Ashbaugh, Presutti and other budget officials are currently drafting and having meetings on the city’s 2019 operating and capital budgets, which will are set to be filed with the Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority in late September. | 21/8/2018 13:59:11 |

| Public Art Chosen for Wightman Park | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/3569_OOA_Designs_LLC_Image.jpg)<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (August 23, 2018) The Public Art + Civic Design Division (PA+CD), on behalf of the Department of Public Works, is pleased to announce the selected artist collective, OOA Designs LLC, who will  be working on the public art component of the upcoming Wightman Park Improvement Project.<br>OOA Designs is composed of three local Pittsburgh artists: Oreen Cohen, Olivia Kissel, and Alison Zapata. The collective creates both aesthetic and functional steel structures that embrace color, form, and nature.<br>Planning improvements for Wightman Park began in 2014 with the development of a Master Plan. The implementation of the Master Plan began in early 2018 with a series of community meetings to gather information and determine public expectations. The information gathered in these meetings, as well as a community survey, helped to inform a new design for the park. Pashek+MTR was hired by The Department of Public Works as the consultant for the project and presented a design to the community that includes a multi-purpose field, half basketball court, playground, walking path, picnic shelter, restroom and stormwater management features.<br>This park is and will be used by people of all ages and abilities with a focus on inclusivity.<br>On May 15, 2018, the Office of Management and Budget released a Request for Proposals to solicit artists, artist collectives, and designers to propose concepts for Public Art interventions at the park. A City Committee evaluated the projects under a scoring system that took into consideration the overall concept of the project with regard to creativity, innovation, aesthetics, and material presence. In addition, applicant’s qualifications, experience, and references, as well as cost proposal were taken into consideration.<br>For the park, OOA Designs proposed works of art that incorporate themes of nature using organic forms and designs inspired by insects, leaf cell structures, fungi, and waterfalls.  The collective will be working with the Department of Public Works, Public Art and Civic Design Division, and Pashek+MTR to hold public meetings and workshops to gather public input and investment in the project. A public meeting will be held to present the final design of the Public Art to be integrated within the project.<br>In this project, as with many others, the Public Art and Civic Design Division is working in collaboration with other departments in the City of Pittsburgh, with the hope of not only nurturing the talent of artists but also of adding to the aesthetic look and feel of the city.<br>For questions about the Art or Artists Contact:<br>Yesica Guerra                                                                                       <br>Public Art and Civic Design Manager<br>City of Pittsburgh<br>Department of City Planning<br>200 Ross St. 4th floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15219<br>\[p\] 412.255.8996<br>\[e\] yesica.guerra@pittsburghpa.gov<br>For questions about the Park Contact:<br>Andrea Ketzel<br>Senior Project Landscape Architect<br>City of Pittsburgh<br>Department of Public Works<br>414 Grant St. Room 301, Pittsburgh, PA 15219<br>\[p\] 412-255-8852<br>\[e\] andrea.ketzel@pittsburghpa.gov | 23/8/2018 14:33:05 |

| New Program to Generate Energy Savings at City Electrical Plugs | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 28, 2018) Mayor William Peduto’s administration today introduced legislation to City Council creating the nation’s first Integrated Energy Savings as a Service initiative, which will deliver energy savings to city facilities. <br>The pilot program with Pittsburgh-based Boss Controls has no upfront costs to the city, which will receive energy rebates from Duquesne Light Co., which is another partner in the program. <br>“This program further cements Pittsburgh’s leadership in energy innovation, and our abilities to both save money and the planet,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>The service will provide immediate energy savings at the plug load for the city. According to Boss Controls, smart plugs will be installed in city facilities that use Sprint’s Magic Box and LTE modems with WiFi to connect the plugs. The Boss Smart Plugs can be added to any electrical devices that need to be scheduled off when the buildings are unoccupied, ultimately netting meaningful cost savings and granting the city a reduced carbon footprint. <br>Emissions from buildings make up roughly 80 percent of the City's carbon footprint, and optimizing energy consumption within city facilities will help to better allocate scarce resources.  <br>The city began the piloting and deployment with Boss Controls and other engaged partners as part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Global City Team Challenge and through the Carnegie Mellon University/City of Pittsburgh Metro 21 program.  <br>Partners in the pilot program include the city's Sustainability and Resilience Division, Facilities Bureau and the Department of Innovation and Performance, as well as Direct Energy Business, Sprint and Duquesne Light Co. <br>“The product deployment is part of the City's Climate Action 3.0 objectives of reducing emissions by 50 percent, and the city's participation in the 2030 District Challenge. The goals of the Challenge – including reducing energy and water consumption by 50 percent – initiated its testing and deployment,” said Grant Ervin, the city’s Chief Resilience Officer. | 28/8/2018 13:52:05 |

The program provides an opportunity for local startups to test their beta-stage products and services in a real-world environment for three-four months.  <br>Through one common application, startups can propose innovative solutions, match with a participating organization and work with a “city champion,” a leader from the participating organization to guide companies through the duration of the pilot project.   <br>“I am happy to see the program growing and also being replicated in other cities. We want to continue learning and working with our local entrepreneurs, give them access to city government and resources, and together with city employees create and inspire solutions that impact people and improve their quality of life,” said Mayor William Peduto.  <br>The City of Pittsburgh and the participating authorities have successfully completed three cycles and engaged 15 local startups, putting forth a variety of technological solutions ranging from food composting, network performance detection, language access consulting, artificial intelligence camera software, to many more.  <br>“Working with the City's Innovation and Performance department was a valuable experience for NetBeez. During the PGH Lab pilot period, we had the chance to work with the City on a real installation of our network monitoring solution, received user feedback, and implemented improvements on the product side. The outcome of the trial was successful, as we on-boarded the City as a new customer,” said Stefano Gridelli, CEO of NetBeez, PGH Lab 3.0 Cohort.  <br>For the fourth cycle, the City of Pittsburgh and the participating authorities welcome the Allegheny Conference on Community Development and its affiliates as a new partner organization.  <br>“We are excited to be participating in PGH Lab to learn how to introduce more pilot testing with local startups in our organization,” said David Ruppersberger, President of the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance.  <br>Starting August 30, 2018, startups can propose solutions to complex challenges in the following areas:  <br>•    **Improve Operations:** Further, improve local government and non-profits’ operations to make internal processes more efficient and effective; <br>•    **Citizen Engagement:** Enhance the lines of communication between local government, non-profits and citizens by expanding digital public engagement and increase opportunities for Pittsburgh’s residents to access information and resources; <br>•    **Climate Change & Environment:** Help Pittsburgh meet its 2030 Climate Action Goals to reduce energy usage by 50% by 2030; and <br>•    **Other:** Suggest a project that does not fall under any of the previous categories but will benefit and make a significant impact in the City and the participating organizations. <br>Selected startups will be offered coworking space, access to the City’s network, and mentoring and guidance from City affiliates.  <br>Participating companies will be selected through a competitive process. The PGH Lab review committee is constituted by various City of Pittsburgh departments, authorities, and non-profit leaders that will identify startup companies to best match priorities and resources within each organization.

The NLC represents over 19,000 cities and towns and USCM is the official non-partisan organization of cities with populations of 30,000 or more. The individual cities and counties that have signed onto the motion are home to more than 22 million people, and include New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, the three largest cities in the Untied States.<br>“Local governments have been leaders in the fight against climate change for decades, and given the Trump administration’s denial of the problem, they have doubled down on their climate commitments,” said Michael Burger, author of the motion, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School and special counsel at the law school’s Environmental Law Clinic. “They’re working hard to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, but local measures can only go so far. Vehicle emission standards are the most effective tool for controlling transportation-related emissions, and local governments lack the authority to create their own standards. So the federal standards are of critical importance.”<br>[Read the motion here.](http://columbiaclimatelaw.com/files/2016/05/Motion-by-Local-Government-Coalition-for-Leave-to-Participate-as-Amici-in-California-v-EPA-Final.pdf)<br>**Contact:**<br>**Michael Burger, Executive Director Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, Columbia Law School Special Counsel, Environmental Law Clinic, Columbia Law School michael.burger@law.columbia.edu (212) 854-2372** | 5/9/2018 14:22:04 |

| Make My Trip Count Commuter Survey Launches | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 10, 2018) The _Make My Trip Count_ regional commuter survey launches today, as part of Pittsburgh’s effort to capture residents’ changing transportation choices. The survey on [MakeMyTripcount.org](http://www.makemytripcount.org/) takes 5 to 10 minutes, and the results will inform critical transportation and infrastructure decisions throughout Western Pennsylvania.<br>“Planning is at the core of what we do to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our residents – both current ones and future ones. Through the _Make My Trip Count_ survey, we learn about the wants and desires of commuters when it comes to transportation,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “Our region has always worked proactively to improve our system and operations by developing a plan. The results of the survey will help lay the foundation for future steps.”<br>Created by Green Building Alliance in partnership with the region’s major transportation partners _Make My Trip Count_ ( _MMTC_) measures traditional transit modes like personal vehicles, light rail, and buses, in addition to ridesharing (such as Uber and Lyft), electric vehicles, and bike share users. In the survey’s 2015 release, more than 20,000 people shared when, from where, how often, and by what modes of transportation they travelled to work.<br>“The _Make My Trip Count survey_ has deepened our understanding of how people move throughout the city,” said City of Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto. “With clear actionable data, we’ve been able to address Pittsburghers’ real transportation needs as we continue to support the city’s economic transformation.”<br>Regional transportation projects like the Bus Rapid Transit expansion and Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission’s long range strategic plan have already used _MMTC_ responses to guide their designs, and respondents have the opportunity to directly influence policies affecting their daily lives. “The survey asks every resident to share their commuter experience,” explains Executive Director of Green Building Alliance Jenna Cramer. “We can only create a healthier and more vibrant city if we understand how all Pittsburghers access economic opportunity.”<br>Respondents who complete the survey will be entered into a drawing to win one of twenty $50 visa gift cards. _Make My Trip Count_ runs from September 10th until October 26th on MakeMyTripCount.org.<br>**ABOUT _MAKE MY TRIP COUNT_:** _Make My Trip Count_ is a strategic study of Pittsburgh’s commuting patterns.

| City Submits Preliminary 2019 Budgets to ICA | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 21, 2018) Mayor William Peduto’s administration today filed preliminary 2019 budgets with the Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority that included no tax increases and increased spending on landslides and flooding, facilities, paving and other priorities. <br>The $568.1 million [Operating Budget](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/3802_Operating_Budget_-_September_2019_FINAL.pdf) and $132.9 million [Capital Budget](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/3781_2019_ICA_Capital_Budget_092118_209.pdf) are required by state law to be filed with the ICA each September. The Mayor’s 2019 budgets will be formally introduced November 13 and Pittsburgh City Council will have until December 31 to approve them.  <br>“These budgets keep us on the sound financial course we started five years ago, while investing in the infrastructure we need to remain a great city for decades to come,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>Highlights include: <br>- $20.3 million in street resurfacing – equaling 75 miles of streets – which is the greatest amount Pittsburgh government has spent on paving in memory. Last year the City budgeted $17 million in paving, which was more than double what the City allocated in previous administrations <br>  <br>- $6 million for landslides and slope failure remediation, which more than doubles what was budgeted this year <br>  <br>- $3.6 million for flood mitigation <br>  <br>- $3 million for the reconstruction of the Public Works 4th Division facility in Knoxville <br>  <br>- More than $1 million for redevelopment of Thaddeus Stevens Elementary School in Elliott into headquarters of the Bureau of Police Special Deployment Division <br>  <br>- $1.4 million for design work on reconfiguration of Stargell Field in Homewood <br>  <br>- Increasing the demolition budget to $2.8 million, nearly $1 million more than in 2018 <br>  <br>- Due to disciplined borrowing practices, the debt service as a percentage of general fund expenditures is a low 8.94 percent. In 2014 the debt service budget was $87,269,068 and the 2019 Debt Service budget is $50,816,684 which is a 41.8% decrease. <br>  <br>Total projected revenues for 2019 are $579.8 million and expenditures $568.1 million, with a projected operating result of $11.7 million. The fund balance as a percentage of general fund expenditures is 11.2 percent. <br>The state law that created the ICA requires the city to submit its budgets to the board in September of every year. While the City officially left Act 47 financial distress early this year, under the same law the ICA will not expire until next year. | 21/9/2018 18:40:45 |

| Peduto Administration Proposes New Accessibility Legislation | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 24, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh Office of Mayor William Peduto is proposing legislation that requires any new or renovated playgrounds to  include at least one Accessible swing according to the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) and at least one wheelchair-accessible swing where space allows.  <br>These efforts first began in 2017 when then-Councilman Dan Gilman joined alongside Mayor William Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works to unveil the first installation of ADA equipment in Mellon Park.  <br>The City has planned a total of 91 installments of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-accessible swings and six wheelchair-accessible swings in 78 parks and playgrounds citywide. The City also unveiled a strategic plan to improve accessibility for children with differing abilities in all City parks and playgrounds. <br>The full legislation is available [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/3805_Legislation_Details_(With_Text)_(3).pdf). | 24/9/2018 14:17:15 |
| New Sprinkler Regulations Proposed for High-Rise Buildings | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 25, 2018) New regulations are being introduced to Pittsburgh City Council today requiring all high-rise buildings to have automatic sprinkler systems for fire protection. <br>Building owners will have 12 years to comply with the regulations, which are part of the state building code. Today’s legislation will make changes to the Pittsburgh fire code to incorporate the regulations into city law. <br>Sprinklers will be required in all buildings that are 75 feet or higher, which typically covers high-rises with six stories or more.  <br>Chief Darryl Jones of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire said the sprinkler requirements would be especially effective for older buildings constructed before sprinkler systems were common, such as the 110-year-old Midtown Towers in Downtown, where one resident died and 100 others were displaced after a fire last year. <br>“If Midtown Towers had sprinklers, it would have been a non-event,” the Chief said. <br>The Chief has been in talks with building owners about the regulations to keep them up to speed on the new regulations. <br>“BOMA Pittsburgh (The Building Owners & Managers Association) has full faith and confidence in Fire Chief Jones, and we are proud of our great working relationships with both the City and the Bureau of Fire. BOMA is confident that Chief Jones and his team will pursue the appropriate local and state policies to ensure the safety of our community,” said BOMA’s executive director Mike Embrescia. <br>The City Council [legislation is here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/3804_Legislation_Details_(With_Text)_(2).pdf), and the sprinkler regulations are spelled out in Appendix M of the International Fire Code, [which is available here](https://codes.iccsafe.org/public/document/IFC2015/appendix-m-high-rise-buildings-retroactive-automatic-sprinkler-requirement). <br>_Contacts:_<br>_Timothy McNulty, Communications Director, Office of Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto, 412-660-1999, timothy.mcnulty@pittsburghpa.gov_<br>_Chris Togneri, Public Information Officer, Department of Public Safety, 412-627-3552, chris.togneri@pittsburghpa.gov_ | 25/9/2018 09:58:44 |

| Pittsburgh Joins Auto, Utility, Labor and Environmental Leaders Unveiling Report Charting Path to Cutting Transportation Energy Use in Half | WASHINGTON – A prominent national transportation commission including Mayor William Peduto released a [new report](http://www.50x50transportation.org/) today and launched a campaign to cut U.S. transportation energy use by 50 percent by 2050 (dubbed the “50x50” goal) while also improving mobility. <br>Amid such rapidly evolving transportation trends as ride-sharing, electrification, autonomous vehicles, and other technologies, the Alliance to Save Energy’s 50x50 Commission on U.S. Transportation Sector Efficiency issued consensus recommendations calling on policymakers – at all levels of government – to act urgently in a coordinated manner to lead a successful energy efficiency transformation of the transportation sector. <br>The 50x50 Commission is a diverse coalition of leading vehicle manufacturers, utilities, environmental and consumer groups, unions, technology companies, and public officials, including Mayor Peduto (D) and Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price (R). The group says the U.S. could fall behind foreign competitors if federal, state, and local policymakers don’t act to adopt the policy recommendations. <br>"It's going to take a lot of work to dramatically reduce transportation energy use, but with the private and public sectors working side-by-side through the 50x50 Commission, we're going to make it happen," Mayor Peduto said. <br>Transportation represents roughly one-third of U.S. energy consumption and recently displaced electricity generation as the leading source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. It’s also the second biggest daily expense for American families. Demand for transportation services is set to rise significantly in the future, potentially increasing congestion on U.S. roads, and putting more stress on the already overburdened public transportation systems. But these challenges can be overcome. The 50x50 Commission united to develop a policy agenda that seizes the opportunities of new transportation technologies and business models to transform mobility for passengers and goods while using energy more efficiently.  <br>“Right now, we have the chance to shape the future for the better, achieving multiple goals at once. We can simultaneously unlock innovation and new technologies and make mobility easier, faster, and better, all while using dramatically less energy,” said Jason Hartke, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, which convened the Commission. “Charting the right path now will help us avoid unpredictable fuel costs, rising greenhouse gas emissions, and lost American competitiveness. These policy recommendations set the course to make transportation more accessible and convenient for all while cutting our energy use dramatically.” <br>The Commission’s report, [released at a forum](https://www.ase.org/events/50x50-commission-transportation-policy-launch) in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday morning, provides recommendations to policymakers focused on three themes, including: <br>**Transform**. Policymakers should not only seek to enhance the energy efficiency of vehicles and components, but also to capitalize on new technologies to transition to an efficient, integrated, and improved “transportation services” model. Transportation services should be allocated efficiently, affordably, and effectively according to geographic and service needs, with policies encouraging consumers to select the most efficient transportation modes. <br>**Innovate**. The U.S. should prioritize its leadership in pursuing research, development, deployment, and demonstration for efficient transportation innovation opportunities. Congress and federal agencies should continue to support the development of electric vehicles, which are currently the most efficient vehicles on the market. Federal agencies should maximize their impact through measures including public-private partnerships that stimulate research into market-transformational technologies. <br>**Invest**. Policymakers should focus on improving the efficiency of all vehicle types by promoting fuel economy standards and accelerating vehicle turnover and incentivizing the deployment of and infrastructure for energy-efficient vehicles, especially electric vehicles (battery-electric vehicles and hydrogen electric vehicles), plug-in and non-plug in hybrid vehicles, and highly efficient vehicles running on renewable natural gas. Policymakers should support electric vehicles, which are highly efficient, through standardization of adaptors and customer experience, the promotion of practices to ensure optimal grid stability, and the redesign of the Highway Trust Fund to ensure the growth of efficient vehicles is balanced with equitably-funded infrastructure investments. Such solutions should take equity and jobs into account by ensuring low-income and under-served consumers have access to improved mobility and ensuring a well-prepared workforce through the sector’s transitions. <br>The 50x50 Commission includes Scott Keogh, President Audi of America (co-chair); Dean Seavers, President, National Grid, US (co-chair); Melissa E. Adams, Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer, WGL Holdings/Washington Gas; John Di Stasio, President, Large Public Power Council; Bruce Edelston, VP, Energy Policy, Southern Company; Matt Enstice, President & CEO, Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus; Jack Gillis, Executive Director, Consumer Federation of America; Thomas R.

| Final 2018 Learn & Earn Summer Numbers | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 4, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and Partner4Work are thrilled to announce that the 2018 Learn & Earn summer youth employment program was able to offer summer jobs to all 2,341 eligible applicants this year, many in high-demand sectors. By partnering with 26 community-based providers this year, Learn & Earn paired 100 more young adults with jobs this summer than in 2017.     <br>Concluding its fourth year, Learn & Earn had 1,813 Allegheny County and City of Pittsburgh residents, ages 14-21, work through the program. Thirty-two of the participants completed the highly selective corporate internship program.  <br>"Since we increased our investment in the Learn and Earn program, our numbers have grown over and above each year," said Mayor William Peduto.  "We have been able to expand our reach and connect a higher number of our young people each year throughout Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods and Allegheny County to career opportunities, not just manual labor jobs. This program has come to be a vital connection for our youth in the summer months to new possibilities." <br>“One of our region’s biggest challenges is ensuring that our residents have the skill sets they need to meet the demand of businesses seeking employees,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “The Learn and Earn Program provides soft skills as well as job experience, preparing the youth who participated for the opportunities that will be available to them in the future. I’m proud that we have been able to continue growing this program and that over 1,8002 youth have had this experience that they can build on for future employment.” <br>Learn & Earn is a six-week program that provides young adults with the opportunity to gain work experience, develop soft skills and explore careers. <br>The program engaged participants in a range of activities, from editing videos and learning archival skills to creating marketing campaigns and performing community research on key issues. The young adults earned more than $1.5 million in wages and around $144,000 in training stipends. They worked more than 215,000 hours (119 average) and had more than 19,800 hours of work-readiness training (11 average). <br>The Learn & Earn application process mirrored that of unsubsidized employment to help young adults learn and practice the critical skill of completing an online job application, adding in supports where necessary. Learn & Earn provided 28 application support centers throughout Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh to provide technical assistance to young adults and their families.  <br>“Learn & Earn helped more young adults become college and career ready this summer thanks to the steadfast commitment and leadership from the County and City, and strong partnerships with employers and community organizations,” said Partner4Work CEO Earl Buford. “We especially want to thank our business partners that hosted corporate interns, providing an opportunity for our region’s future leaders to explore careers, gain work experience, build valuable skills, and make the connection between their education and their future .” | 4/10/2018 10:09:43 |

| City Scores 100 On 2018 Municipal Equality Index Scorecard | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 8, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh, Office of Mayor William Peduto is proud to share that for the second year in a row the City scored 100 on the Human Rights Commission [Municipal Equality Index Scorecard](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/MEI-2018-Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania.pdf?_ga=2.22357746.810720288.1539003479-2029540437.1539003479) (MEI). The 2018 MEI scorecard graded the City on clear criteria, non-discrimination laws, municipal services, law enforcement, and leadership on LGBTQ equality.  <br>A few examples of areas MEI scored cities on include the offering of transgender-inclusive healthcare benefits, providing services to LGBTQ youth and elderly, an LGBTQ police liaison, and non-discrimination in City employment. While the final score cannot exceed 100 the city has a total of 11 bonus points it received.  <br>The MEI rates municipalities of varying sizes from across the United States, this year they rated 506 cities including Pittsburgh.  As the City of Pittsburgh forges forward, it is initiatives like this that help keep us accountable and transparent and are paramount to making a city for all. In less than three years we have improved our score and have been able to make significant improvements. Understanding that there is more work that needs to be done the city uses this information to make recommendations and changes within Pittsburgh to bring about an environment of equity for all.   ![](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/MEI-2018-Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania.pdf?_ga=2.22357746.810720288.1539003479-2029540437.1539003479)![](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/MEI-2018-Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania.pdf?_ga=2.22357746.810720288.1539003479-2029540437.1539003479)![](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/MEI-2018-Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania.pdf?_ga=2.22357746.810720288.1539003479-2029540437.1539003479)![](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/MEI-2018-Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania.pdf?_ga=2.22357746.810720288.1539003479-2029540437.1539003479) | 8/10/2018 13:11:53 |

| City Seeking New Ways to Increase Women and Minority Firefighter Candidates | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 2, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh is looking for ways to increase the numbers of qualified women and minority firefighter candidates, and is asking for insights from workplace experts.<br>The City issued a Request For Information last month to find creative approaches to make the firefighting hiring process more inclusive, and reduce barriers to entry that deter women and minority participation in Fire Bureau careers.<br>“It is vitally important that any emergency services, or public safety organization is representative of the community it serves,” said Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones. “Diversity within the organization increases public confidence and trust.”<br>The RFI was issued with the support of International Association of Fire Fighters Local No. 1.<br>“We all understand there are benefits to diversity in the workplace for both the employees and the citizens we serve,” said Ralph Sicuro, President of Pittsburgh Fire Fighters Local No. 1. “We are glad to see the city is proactively looking at ways to approach this issue of diversity and look forward to working with them on way to improve our recruitment.”<br>The objectives of the request are:<br>- To review the City’s firefighter hiring policies and practices, paying particular attention to their effectiveness and fairness.<br>- To better understand recruiting and outreach efforts<br>- Document and assess the inherent duties and knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics needed to successfully perform the job of firefighter at the City<br>- Gain a better understanding of the current firefighter selection process and outline a new firefighter hiring process using industry best practices<br>- Make recommendations that are intended to increase the efficiency of the hiring process, bolster the evidence supporting the validity of it, and make it more transparent and inclusive<br>- Learn more information about alternative methods to prevent the exclusion of women and minority participation and increase the targeting of highly qualified women and minority candidates.<br>[A copy of the RFI is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/3869_Fire_Barrier_Assessment_RFI.pdf). | 9/10/2018 10:29:41 |

| Financial Empowerment Centers to Provide Free Financial Advice | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 10, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh and Neighborhood Allies are proud to announce the selection of Advantage Credit Counseling to hire and deploy financial coaches that will be available across the city and free to use for all Pittsburghers. The City and Neighborhood Allies partnered with Cities for Financial Empowerment, a non-profit group from New York dedicated to financial inclusion, to create a plan to implement the Financial Empowerment Center (FEC) model in Pittsburgh. The FEC is a free financial coaching service available to all City residents, and is due to launch in 2019. <br>The Pittsburgh Financial Empowerment Center will be operated by Advantage Credit Counseling to hire and deploy coaches and partner with community organizations across the city to deliver recurring professional financial coaching services.  Pittsburgh was asked to be in the second cohort of twelve cities to join the Cities for Financial Empowerment coalition, first developed in 2013 by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City. <br>This work will be funded over the next 2 years using $600,000 provided by Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, BNY Mellon Foundation and the Hillman Foundation.  This is part of a coordinated approach to financial inclusion involving over 20 partner organizations providing an array of services convened and led by Neighborhood Allies through the Asset Building Network. <br>Financial Empowerment Centers will complement existing Financial Opportunity Centers (FOCs), a five year old effort from Neighborhood Allies that combines financial education with employment services and access to income supports. Service providers for FOCs are: Goodwill of Southwestern PA, Oakland Planning and Development Corporation and Mon Valley Initiative.  The FOC model integrates one-on-one financial coaching into existing employment services to assist job seekers to increase income, wealth and build credit, with the goal of financial security. Now with the introduction of FECs into Pittsburgh, more Pittsburghers will have access to a trained professional who can help them reach their financial goals. Nationally, the FECs have served 80,000 clients and reduced $94 million in debt and $9 million in savings.  This free municipal service offered in partnership with Neighborhood Allies will focus on establishing credit, building savings, reducing debt, and banking safely for its clients, who have in other cities, increased their savings by one week’s income. <br>“As Pittsburgh evolves into a new economic era we need to be sure residents have access to the tools they need to participate in and benefit from the new opportunities those changes provide.  I am proud to partner with Neighborhood Allies, Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, Advantage Credit Counseling, community and philanthropic partners to ensure that all Pittsburghers have access to financial skills to achieve their dreams for themselves and their families,” said Mayor William Peduto.<br>“We believe that all Pittsburghers, regardless of where they live, should have access to economic opportunity and prosperity. We are pleased to join forces with the City of Pittsburgh, Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, and local philanthropic partners to expand the access to high-quality financial coaching for Pittsburgh’s residents,” said Presley Gillespie, President of Neighborhood Allies.<br>“Advantage CCS is thrilled to partner with the City of Pittsburgh and Neighborhood Allies to bring Financial Empowerment Centers to our community.  Financial counseling is a critical component of helping consumers achieve financial goals.  We are excited to add four new counselors and a program manager to our workforce and are currently accepting applications for these positions,” said Mary Loftus, Co-President/Co-CEO Advantage Credit Counseling Service, Inc. <br>_Interested in applying to be an [FEC Manager](https://jobs.nonprofittalent.com/job/advantage-credit-counseling-service-inc-pittsburgh-38-financial-empowerment-center-nonprofit-program-manager/) or [Financial Counselor](https://jobs.nonprofittalent.com/job/advantage-credit-counseling-service-inc-pittsburgh-38-financial-empowerment-center-financial-counselor/)?

| Governor Wolf and DCNR Announce Funding for Renovation of Elliott Park | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 11, 2018) Governor Tom Wolf and the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources [are awarding $200,000 for the further development of Townsend Parklet in Elliott](https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/DCNR_details.aspx?newsid=503). <br>The funding will support renovation of pedestrian walkways and a basketball court, installation of play equipment with required safety surfacing, fencing, lighting and utilities; ADA access; landscaping; and other improvements. <br>"I was pleased to support the City’s funding request to DCNR for Townsend Parklet and am thrilled to see these renovations move forward.

| City Seeks Input on New Bike Plan | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 16, 2018) In support of ongoing efforts to provide a more sustainable transportation system, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is pleased to announce plans to create a new Pittsburgh Bike Plan.

| Lead Line Replacement Program Receives Major Investment from Wolf Administration | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 17, 2018) The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority is receiving more than $49 million in loans and grants to significantly boost efforts to protect the city’s drinking water, Governor Tom Wolf announced today. <br>The Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST) approved the funding this morning as part of $93 million in investments in water projects statewide. PWSA received a $35,441,231 loan and a $13,687,173 grant to replace 2,800 residential public lead connections, including 2,400 private lead service lines. <br>“I’m proud to support such an important infrastructure project for Pittsburgh,” said Governor Wolf. “Investing our resources to replace lead lines will benefit public health, the environment, and support a sustainable Pittsburgh for residents to enjoy.” <br>Securing state funding for lead line replacements has been a top priority for Mayor William Peduto and members of his senior staff, and follows numerous meetings between officials from the City and the Governor’s Office. <br>“Pittsburgh has been making great strides to protect its drinking water and this announcement from Governor Wolf gives that work a tremendous lift,” Mayor William Peduto said. “On behalf of Pittsburgh’s residents I want to thank all our partners – including the Governor, the Department of Environmental Protection, PENNVEST and PWSA – for making an investment that will have positive impacts for decades to come.” <br>PWSA launched a $44 million ratepayer-funded lead line replacement program in March of this year, so the state’s $49 million investment will more than double the funding for the citywide work. The $35 million loan is extremely low interest, at a rate of 1 percent with repayment over 30 years. <br>Under DEP requirements, PWSA replaced more than 1,300 lead service lines in the first six months of this year and is on track to replace hundreds more by the end of 2018. <br>The Peduto administration and PWSA – in consultation with DEP and a Blue Ribbon Panel named by Mayor Peduto in early 2017 – have been addressing concerns about unsafe levels of lead in Pittsburgh’s drinking water for more than two years. <br>Under state and federal regulations water providers such as PWSA must perform semiannual lead compliance testing, and testing results from June 2016 showed 22 parts per billion (ppb) of lead, which exceeded the acceptable level of 15 ppb or below. Working diligently to address the issue the Peduto administration and PWSA were able to report at the most recent testing period ending in June 2018 that the lead level was down to 10 ppb. <br>Until a state law change in November 2017 municipal water authorities were barred from replacing privately-owned lead lines, forcing PWSA to perform only partial lead line replacements. In June 2017 the authority, in consultation with the Peduto administration and the Allegheny County Health Department, halted that practice due to concerns that the partial replacements could increase drinking water lead levels. The state law change championed by Sen. Wayne Fontana finally allowed PWSA to start performing full lead line replacements this year. <br>Other efforts are underway to address lead in the city’s water system. With DEP approval PWSA is in the process of adding orthophosphates – an additive demonstrated to be highly effective at reducing corrosion from lead pipes – to the system. Last month the authority began flushing water out of the system to prepare for orthophosphate, and is installing new equipment to administer its addition.  <br>More information on the [PWSA Community Lead Response program is available here](http://lead.pgh2o.com/). | 17/10/2018 10:11:22 |

| Mayor Peduto Thanks Governor and General Assembly for Passage of Common Sense Criminal Justice Bill | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 19, 2018) Mayor William Peduto is thanking Gov. Tom Wolf and the General Assembly for the approval this week of House Bill 163, a measure he and other Pittsburgh leaders advocated that removes automatic driver’s license suspensions for low-level crimes, which blocked many hard-working residents from employment opportunities. <br>Before the approval of the legislation, any drug-related crime led to an automatic driver’s license suspension, even for non-driving related crimes. Effectively it kept many residents from having access to job opportunities since they were barred from driving. <br>Mayor Peduto wrote Senate and House leaders [a letter in May](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1881) in support of the change, which was also supported by the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, the Pittsburgh Equitable Development Collaborative and others. <br>“If our goal is to create productive members of society, HB 163 works to ensure that formerly incarcerated people are not continually punished after they’ve paid their debt to society,” the Mayor wrote. | 19/10/2018 13:42:13 |

| Mike Bloomberg Names Pittsburgh Winner in Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 21, 2018) Today, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced Pittsburgh as a winning city in the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge. The Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge is a $70 million dollar program that will accelerate 20 ambitious cities’ efforts to tackle climate change and promote a sustainable future for residents. Through the Climate Challenge – which is part of Bloomberg’s American Cities Initiative, a suite of more than $200 million in investments to strengthen city halls and advance critical policies – Pittsburgh is accepted into a two-year acceleration program, will be provided powerful new resources and access to cutting-edge support to help meet or beat the city’s near-term carbon reduction goals.<br>Bloomberg Philanthropies selected Pittsburgh as a winning city because of their innovative and ambitious climate action plans to reduce air pollution and city-wide emissions with specific projects aimed at reforming their respective transit and buildings sectors, areas which are typically responsible for 80% total of all citywide emissions and over which mayors have significant authority. Bloomberg Philanthropies also recognizes Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto for his commitment to ambitious climate action and securing a cleaner, safer, and healthier environment and economy for their residents.<br>Pittsburgh will receive an estimated $2.5 million in support for its climate initiatives.<br>"When Bloomberg Philanthropies announced the Climate Challenge, cities all across the country, with both Republican and Democratic mayors, put forward thoughtful and innovative proposals. Selecting the ones with the boldest goals — and the most realistic plans for reaching them — was not easy,” said Mike Bloomberg, UN Special Envoy for Climate Action. “But Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston, and D.C. all stood out, and we're glad to include them in the group of winners. With our federal government asleep at the wheel, cities are more important than ever in the fight against climate change — and these cities are stepping up to the challenge. Congratulations to them all."<br>Pittsburgh today joined Philadelphia, Boston, and Washington, D.C.as winning cities in the American Cities Climate Challenge, joining Seattle, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Portland, San Diego, and San Jose.<br>“Pittsburgh and other cities around the globe are leading the charge in fighting climate change,” Mayor Peduto said. “That means not only making smart choices about Pittsburgh’s own energy usage, but banding with other partners to achieve substantial energy reductions worldwide. We’re thrilled to be working with Bloomberg Philanthropies in these efforts.”<br>“The Paris climate agreement is a promise we made to our children—and we’re going to keep it,” said Rhea Suh, President of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The American Cities Climate Challenge gives cities the tools they need to lead the way. With cities generating the majority of the fossil fuel pollution driving climate change, and bearing the brunt of its impacts, fighting climate change begins in City Hall. These mayors are committed to delivering a brighter, more hopeful tomorrow for future generations.”<br>Pittsburgh plans to use this support to further the ongoing initiatives in its Climate Action Plan, and Bloomberg Philanthropies will work the city to achieve the following actions by 2020:<br>- Scale renewable power throughout the city through new community solar programs<br>- Deepen energy efficiency efforts through new financing programs and implementation of the city’s new energy transparency benchmarking ordinance<br>- Expand bike and pedestrian infrastructure in priority areas in the city<br>Today’s press conference at the West End Overlook also included a preview of the upcoming National Geographic documentary “Paris to Pittsburgh.” The trailer [can be viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFznn8FNRbU)<br>As Climate Challenge winners, the 20 winning cities will be accepted into a two-year acceleration program with powerful new resources and access to cutting-edge support, led by experts at the Natural Resources Defense Council, Delivery Associates and others, to help them meet – or beat – their near-term carbon reduction goals, from creating high-impact policies to putting them into action. These resources include a philanthropy-funded team member to facilitate the development and passage of high impact policies, training for senior leadership to assist with implementation of their proposed climate plans, and citizen engagement support to maximize community buy-in.<br>Building on the America’s Pledge initiative, which aims to keep the U.S. in the Paris Agreement, the Climate Challenge underscores Bloomberg’s dedication to action as this investment will translate city commitments into tangible climate achievements. Bloomberg will announce the remaining winners of the Climate Challenge on a rolling basis throughout the fall, highlighting the ongoing, ambitious, and impactful actions cities are taking every day to address the growing threat of climate change.<br>###<br>**About Bloomberg Philanthropies**<br>Bloomberg Philanthropies works in 480 cities in more than 120 countries around the world to ensure better, longer lives for the greatest number of people.

| Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Paid Sick Leave and Security Training Legislation | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 23, 2018) Mayor William Peduto issued the following statement today following a state Supreme Court hearing on challenges to city paid sick leave and security training legislation approved in 2015: <br>“The residents of Pittsburgh, City Council and I overwhelmingly support paid sick days and the Safe and Secure Building Act. People should not have to make the tough decision of staying home sick and missing a day’s pay or coming in to work and spreading infection. Security officers across the city are on the front lines and the first people called upon to assist first responders in any emergency. These are both common sense issues. <br>Pittsburghers know what Pittsburghers need. We are a home rule municipality precisely so that we can craft and legislate solutions to our own problems, and that is just what we did in approving these bills three years ago. I hope the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agrees and respects our authority as a home rule city.” | 23/10/2018 15:18:18 |

| Improvements Made to Two Landslide Sites in Southern Neighborhoods | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 25, 2018) Mayor William Peduto’s administration is pleased to announce improvements that have been implemented at two landslide sites in the city’s southern neighborhoods. <br>Advent Street in Elliott has been remediated and reopened, and improvements have been made to two parts of William Street in Mount Washington, one of them above the southern end of the Liberty Tunnel. <br>The city’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) has been in charge of the landslide work impacting streets citywide. In 2018 alone the department has responded to 22 landslide events. <br>Advent Street in Elliot experienced significant land subsidence that required the street to be closed in March 2018. DOMI commissioned geotechnical assessments in April and May, and began remediation work in July. The street reopened to traffic in September.  <br>Work improvements on Advent included: <br>- New guiderail <br>  <br>- Improved drainage <br>  <br>- Rebuilt and resurfaced street  <br>  <br>In February 2018, a major slide occurred above McArdle Roadway on William Street in Mount Washington. The landslide caused major subsidence and required the closure of William Street from 100 feet after Cola Street to approximately 500 feet above Arlington Avenue.  <br>The slope movement was so great that the segment of roadway will not be restored in the foreseeable future. However, DOMI has been working diligently to improve the remaining segments of William Street both at the top and the bottom of the slope. <br>On lower William Street, above Arlington Avenue, DOMI mitigated a mine blowout above the Liberty Tunnel, installing catch basins and crushed limestone French drains to neutralize and handle the acidic mine water runoff.  <br>On upper William Street, the City has been working with neighborhood residents on road widening and drainage issues to improve safety and performance in winter months. DOMI has invested more than $700,000 to address the slope failure including substantial geotechnical investigations, excavation and soil removal work, addressing long standing drainage issues, and rebuilding sidewalks and retaining structures impacted by the widening. <br>Here are before and after photos of Advent Street:<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4042_Advent_before.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4045_Advent_after.jpg)<br>Here are before and after photos of William Street:<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4047_William_before.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4044_William_after.jpg) | 25/10/2018 09:14:47 |

| Mayor William Peduto Submits 2019 Budgets to Pittsburgh City Council | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 13, 2018) Mayor William Peduto today presented the city’s proposed 2019 Operating and Capital budgets to Pittsburgh City Council. They included no tax increases, and included increased spending on priorities including landslides and flooding, facilities, paving and other needs. <br>They are the first budgets to be formally introduced to Council since the city left Act 47 financially distressed status early this year. <br>Total projected revenues for 2019 are $579,421,038 million and expenditures $571,531,034 million. The fund balance as a percentage of general fund expenditures is 11.42%. <br>“The fifth budget I’ve presented as Mayor continues to cement the City’s long-term financial stability, while investing in core services, neighborhood development, infrastructure needs and our hard-working employees,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>With an emphasis on government efficiency, the Operating Budget focuses on new staffing needs for the Departments of City Planning, Mobility and Infrastructure, and Permits, Licenses and Inspections. It executes a dynamic, new snow route optimization program, and fully funds body-worn cameras for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police that include new sidearm sensors. Budgeted Public Safety staffing remains at historic levels, with plans this year for three police recruit classes and a firefighter recruit class. <br>Further budget highlights include: <br>- $20.3 million in street resurfacing – equaling 75 miles of streets – which is the greatest amount Pittsburgh government has spent on paving in memory. Last year the City budgeted $17 million in paving, which was more than double what the City allocated in previous administrations <br>- $6.8 million for landslides and slope failure remediation, which more than doubles what was budgeted this year <br>- $3.6 million for flood mitigation <br>- $3 million for the reconstruction of the Public Works 4th Division facility in Knoxville <br>- More than $1 million for redevelopment of Thaddeus Stevens Elementary School in Elliott into headquarters of the Bureau of Police Special Deployment Division <br>- $1.4 million for design work on reconfiguration of Stargell Field in Homewood <br>- Increasing the demolition budget to $3.2 million, which is a $1 million increase over 2018 <br>City Council is set to begin its discussions on the budgets at noon on Monday, November 19. It will then hold several budget overviews with city departments before holding a tentative line-item vote on December 11. A final vote is scheduled for December 18. <br>Electronic copies are available for the [operating](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4189_2019_Operating_Budget.pdf) and [capital](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4188_2019_Capital_Budget.pdf) budgets. | 13/11/2018 09:39:49 |

| Color Beechview, a Community Art Project Bringing Generations Together, Debuts on Broadway Avenue | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4192_Color_Beechview_flyer_FINAL_event_English.jpg)<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (November 14, 2018) The Public Art and Civic Design Division of the Department of City Planning and Citiparks, in collaboration with Age-Friendly Greater Pittsburgh, are pleased to present the unveiling of Color Beechview, a community public art project that adds vibrancy to the neighborhood and builds intergenerational solidarity.<br>The different partners in this project had the goal of creating a colorful public art installation for a space welcoming people of all ages during the design process of creating the artwork. In addition, the project aimed to bring together residents from all walks of life in a community that is undergoing rapid demographic changes. It is hoped that a project of this nature could be the precedent for other initiatives similar to this in other City facilities, thus bringing integration, programming, and activation to these sites as well as exposure among residents to public art.<br>The collaborative artmaking process was guided by Lively Pittsburgh and visual artist Lori Hepner, whose work merges photography, wearable technology, and active motion. During three public events in September and October, Hepner facilitated community members as they engaged in discussion and performance. Participants utilized light-based technology to create designs in real time using the movements of their bodies in a process that was accessible to people of all ages and ability levels.  To learn about Artist Lori Hepner’s work follow www.lorihepner.com. <br>The temporary work of art produced during the community sessions will be unveiled at an event on:<br>**Thursday, November 15, 2018**<br>**3:30 pm – 5:00 pm**<br>**1555 Broadway Ave.**<br>**Pittsburgh, PA 15216**<br>In addition to the public installation of the artwork at the Beechview Healthy Active Living Center, an Allegheny County Port Authority T-Car of the RED Line will be featuring one of the art pieces produced by the community.

| Upgrades Announced for Public Works Snow and Ice Control Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 14, 2018) The Office of Mayor William Peduto today unveiled new upgrades to the city’s 2018-2019 snow and ice control programs. <br>After a review of last year’s responses to winter weather, the Department of Public Works is introducing upgrades including a modified road salt mixture, enhanced technologies, increased vehicle capacity, new personnel changes, and a pilot program reintroducing a set number of salt boxes throughout the City. <br>The new salt material will be a tinted color blue to help residents see that it has been applied to road surfaces. The new salt mixture will have a lower melting point which is especially beneficial in the colder months.   <br>City DPW trucks are being equipped with new technology that will allow for the public and supervisory personnel to see when a vehicle’s plow is up and down, or if the salt spreader is off or on.  The new technology will provide DPW workers with clearer road clearing instruction and allow the City to move away from paper-based snow removal and salt spreading routes, and now be loaded into in-cab tablets.  <br>The upgrades are being implemented through the winter. **The current Snow Plow Tracker on the city’s website will be suspended until January 2019 when the new tracker and its upgraded features can be launched.**<br>Presently the City has 104 vehicles that are equipped with plows and spreaders and another 33 vehicles that are equipped with only plows. At full capacity – if no trucks are out for repair –the City has 137 vehicles.   <br>New personnel policy adjustments now allow DPW to bring on Bureau of Environmental Services drivers to help with snow removal after all other resources are exhausted, in accordance with labor agreements. This will serve as a critical change during weekends and holidays when the City has previously faced challenges having a sufficient number of employees to staff the vehicles.  <br>New callout procedures have been amended to provide better oversight of how personnel are called to work during snow events and how overtime is offered. <br>The Department of Public Works plans to add 44 salt boxes throughout the City, in a fixed pilot program in targeted areas. These boxes will be placed at streets that are hilly, have sharp bends, and near steps. <br>Further details on the changes are listed below:  <br>- Rock Salt uniformly tinted blue and coated with Magnesium Chloride+OBPE (Organic Based Performance Enhancer) <br>- Deicing material has a lower melting point (-25 degrees Fahrenheit to -30 degrees Fahrenheit versus 15 degrees Fahrenheit for regular rock salt) <br>- Material is color coated  so drivers and pedestrians can visually see that material initially has been applied to the road surface <br>- Approximately 16,000 tons of regular rock salt, stockpiled from the previous October 2017-April 2018 winter weather season, will be used in the initial winter weather events until the product is drawn down. Then the newer Magnesium Chloride salt will be loaded into the City’s covered domes and covered outside storage areas <br>- This new deicing material with its lower melting point should prove to be especially beneficial in January and February when temperatures hover at 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower<br>Enhanced Technologies <br>- Snow Plow Tracker will take on a new look with the addition of showing the public and the City’s supervisory personnel  when a vehicle’s plow is up or down, or if the salt spreader is on or off.  Eventually the street network will be color coded to reflect jurisdictional responsibilities (i.e. city owned streets, County and State roads within the city, State Roads maintained by the City, etc.) <br>- Vehicles are being up fitted with new GPS technology hardware including the calibration of the spreader/auger/spinner so all winter weather vehicles will be applying the enhanced rock salt at a predetermined rate of application based on conditions.  This upgrade alone is expected to save the City millions of dollars in salt expenditures. <br>- Existing salt routes are being loaded into in-cab tablets so all the drivers will have to do is select a route and follow its voice commands – no longer will they have to keep referring back and forth with the paper routes, though they will still be in vehicles as a backup. <br>Personnel <br>- DPW continues to fill truck driver vacancies and is adding more personnel who possess a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL), which gives the department more resources to operate the vehicles regardless of shift <br>- DPW will also now have the ability to reach out to drivers in the Bureau of Environmental Services after all other resources have been exhausted. This could be especially critical on the weekends and holidays when in the past it was difficult getting a sufficient number of employees to staff the vehicles | 14/11/2018 11:58:57 |

| Kennard Park & Field Master Plan Receives Grant Funding | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 16, 2018) Mayor William Peduto is proud to announce that community conservation partnerships program granted the City of Pittsburgh with a $40,000 grant toward the preparation of a master site development plan for the 13.4 acre Kennard Park in the historic Hill District.  <br>“Upgrading Kennard field was identified as a critical component to the Hill District master plan. I am pleased to be able to begin the planning process to ensure it remains a critical asset for families of the Hill District and beyond for years to come,” said Councilman Daniel R. Lavelle.  <br>This park is located at one of the main entrances to Pittsburgh's Hill District at Kirkpatrick Street and Reed Street and requires a master plan to  optimize its service to the community and the environment. A master plan will provide the basis for capital investment as recommended in the city's Open Space Plan, and supported by the city's long ­range capital budget plan.   <br>Currently, Kennard Park is heavily utilized for sports but hampered by a dangerous entrance and chaotic parking, while also lacking ADA accessibility. The master plan for Kennard Park presents an opportunity to leverage several concurrent planning projects, coordinate planning efforts and project implementation, and strengthen fundraising appeals.    <br>“As a parent whose children utilize this park often I am happy and appreciative for the City and States resources to help upgrade Kennard for all the families to enjoy,” said State Representative Jake Wheatley.  <br>The lack of a community-scale park in the Hill District made this a priority for the Peduto administration. The 9,500 residents living in this neighborhood need a high quality, accessible space for outdoor recreation and this is a prime opportunity to move forward on this vital project.  <br>Specifically, the plans will provide for the following: <br>1.     Maintaining and enhancing trees and natural landscaping through: <br>a.     Designing with native trees, shrubs, grasses, and wildflowers; <br>b.    Minimizing large areas of unused turf and planting low-mow grass; <br>c.     Maximizing natural landscape areas to increase water infiltration and to reduce maintenance costs, use of pesticides and fertilizers, and watering; <br>d.    Improving forest health through an ongoing program of tree replacement and new plantings to restore the forest canopy, improve air quality, and provide a natural source of cooling and shade to combat summer heat; and <br>e.     Managing invasive plants through ongoing removal of non-native species and planting native species. <br>2.     Connect people to nature by providing: <br>a.     Opportunities for interaction with nature through a diverse landscape that supports a range of users and activities; <br>b.    A combination of spaces for physical activity, nature exploration, and playgrounds that are designed to meet the needs of children and multigenerational users; <br>c.     Non-traditional playgrounds that use the landscape and natural materials to promote exploration and imaginative play; <br>d.    Passive experiences with nature for relaxation and reflection; <br>e.     Opportunities for social interaction to promote community building and strong neighborhoods; and <br>f.     Signage that explains the ecological and conservation practices used in park maintenance (recycling, composting, integrated pest and weed management, etc.) <br>3.     Manage stormwater with a green-first approach that relies on natural green infrastructure including: <br>a.     Commitment to a green-first approach to stormwater management; <br>b.    Incorporating infiltration basins, bioswales, rain gardens, and permeable pavement into all park planning and landscape improvements; and <br>c.     Use captured rainwater for irrigation. <br>4.     Energy conservation through: <br>a.     Controlled illumination and the use of low-voltage or LED exterior lighting; <br>b.    Use of solar technology as a power source for general landscape and signage illumination; and <br>c.     Motion-sensors on interior lighting, as well as for faucets and toilets in restrooms. <br>5.     Integrate green design and construction practices into park planning, design and construction: <br>a.     Use locally sourced and recycled and/or recyclable materials whenever possible; and <br>b.    Consider ongoing and long-term maintenance issues and costs in design and construction. | 16/11/2018 13:58:18 |

| Pittsburgh Receives Federal Funding to Reunite Children in Foster Care with Their Families | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 26, 2018) Mayor William Peduto and the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh are pleased to announce that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued the authority a $556,000 grant to help children in foster care reunite with their families or caregivers.<br>HUD last week made 77 vouchers available to the Housing Authority for families whose inadequate housing situations caused their separation from children, or made such separation imminent.<br>“The Family Unification Program will provide HACP and DHS with the resources to house and serve 77 families in critical need for affordable housing. We’re proud to help end the placement of children outside of their homes and to providing families with the resources they need to establish secure, stable housing and the opportunity to achieve a better quality of life,” said HACP Executive Director Caster D. Binion.<br>HUD awarded a total of $1.5 million to housing authorities in Pittsburgh, Chester and Bucks County for the initiative, called the [Family Unification Program (FUP)](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv/family) _._ It provides rental assistance to parents being separated from their children or to those who are at risk of separation. Additionally, this funding is used to help provide stable housing for young adults (ages 18-24) who have aged-out of the foster care system.<br>HACP administers the program with the Allegheny County Department of Human Services, which refers eligible families to the authority.<br>“We appreciate the assistance that this funding provides. For those who receive the vouchers, we can now begin working towards more permanent housing solutions to help aid families at risk of losing their children or youth transitioning out of foster care,” said DHS Director Marc Cherna.<br>Like HUD's Housing Choice Vouchers, these vouchers allow families to rent housing from a private landlord and generally pay 30 percent of their monthly adjusted gross income towards rent and utilities.<br>A fact sheet on FUP vouchers [is available here](https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/FUP_FACT_SHEET.PDF). | 26/11/2018 15:12:35 |

| City of Tomorrow Challenge Winners Named | PITTSBURGH, PA. (November 28, 2018) After working collaboratively with the residents in Pittsburgh to identify transportation challenges and propose new ways to improve mobility in their communities, the City of Pittsburgh Office of Mayor William Peduto and Department of Mobility and Infrastructure are proud to announce the winning pilot proposals for the Ford City of Tomorrow Challenge™. <br>Two of the winners, iomob and Safe Shift, will each be rewarded with $50,000 in prize money to test the implementation of their proposal in the real world. The third winner, Intersection, has requested no prize money from the City of Tomorrow Challenge, as its proposed LinkPGH program is supported through its own advertising revenue. <br>The first of the three winners is iomob, a user-friendly, open and inclusive form of “mobility as a service” aimed at addressing “inefficiencies” in a multi-modal but “fragmented mobility landscape.” Iomob allows end-users to discover, combine, book, and pay for the mobility services that best cover their needs at a given point of time. Iomob will be implemented as an open-source, decentralized platform that leverages blockchain to allow all mobility providers to easily join the platform. By connecting all the mobility operators in an area, iomob aims to enable users to find better combinations of services for any given trip. <br>Safe Shift, meanwhile, is a team that came together as part of the Mobiliti Conference in Pittsburgh in early October. The team consists of representatives from local transportation and advocacy groups, students, and an urban mobility data and analytics company called Moovit. Safe Shift is focused on getting night shift workers to and from work safely and efficiently. By talking to local employers, the Safe Shift team identified the needs of shift workers who travel while tired and in the dark, and they plan to aid these shift workers by providing safe and reliable transit during off peak and unpredictable hours. <br>Finally, Intersection has been chosen as the third winner. Intersection is a company that aims to address the connectivity gap many Pittsburgh residents face, whether it’s connectivity to the internet, local transit information, or city services. To address these needs, Intersection proposes to deploy digital kiosks, dubbed LinkPGH, which provide free high-speed public WiFi, phone calls to anywhere in the U.S., device charging, wayfinding, community messaging, and other amenities around the city. <br>“The people of Pittsburgh were integral to this Challenge,” said Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto. “They defined the need. Testing this in the real world, they will also help us evaluate this as a solution. We appreciate the partnership with Ford in not only thinking deeply about the <br>challenges we face, but helping us to act quickly to find the ideas and entrepreneurs that can help address them.” <br>Launched in June, the City of Tomorrow Challenge™ is a crowdsourcing platform created to help prepare cities for the future by identifying new mobility designs and innovations that could improve the way people get around. The Challenge platform brought together officials, residents and local businesses in Pittsburgh, as well as key program sponsors AT&T, Dell Technologies, Microsoft and the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, encouraging people to share their mobility experiences. <br>“These proposals all focus on some of the issues that Pittsburgh residents shared with us during the community engagement phases of the Challenge,” said John Kwant, vice president, Ford City Solutions. “Working closely and collaborating with the people who will use solutions like these are one way in which we hope we can start to make a positive impact on people’s mobility.” <br>After hearing numerous stories from local Pittsburgh residents, the City of Tomorrow Challenge received more than 125 unique proposals for mobility solution pilots. The Challenge’s Steering Committee, comprised of industry experts, partner representatives, and locals, selected 13 semi-finalists. Those semi-finalists had the opportunity to work with a mentor and local accelerator to further refine their proposals before a winner was selected. <br>Throughout the Challenge, people were encouraged to submit ideas in four key areas: <br>\\* Enable Simple Transportation Choices: How might we bring useful information that increases traveler confidence in a variety of different transportation options? Knowing when the bus will arrive, where the bike paths are, where the safe sidewalks are, how traffic or weather will impact driving time, and even what side of the street to stand on while waiting for the bus are key for planning one’s commute. Information, whether it is displayed digitally on a smartphone, written on a physical sign, or shared between neighbors, is fundamental to moving around the city. <br>\\* Extend Mobility Options: How might we extend the reach of the existing transportation networks with new services and modes? What mobility options can extend or enhance the existing infrastructure and services? How can we improve access to work, education, health, and public services, and build off existing transit, bike-share and other services, especially for those who currently have issues accessing them? How can we increase viable transportation options at times when there are few good choices? <br>\\* Encourage Walking, Biking, And Busing: How might we build travelers’ confidence and desire to walk, bike, or take the bus as a part of their everyday trips? For example, riding a bike alone around the city for the first time can be daunting for even the most seasoned cyclist. A visitor may not know how to pay for the bus or signal the stop they want to get off on. People may get turned around and confused on city streets or not understand how to cross a complicated intersection. What solutions might raise the “journey confidence” of Pittsburgh travelers or lower the barriers to trying something new, like walking, biking, or taking the bus? <br>\\* Design Creative Infrastructure: How might we enhance the transportation experience through the design of welcoming infrastructure? Travel should be inviting and even fun, whether it is an everyday commute or a special trip to see the sights. Travelers should feel <br>respected, and waiting and travel should be a dignified experience. Applicants were encouraged to submit proposals for creative designs or technologies to improve the infrastructure and enhance the experience of getting from place to place. This includes new ideas and designs that improve walking on a sidewalk, crossing an intersection, biking, waiting at a bus stop, or other parts of people’s journeys. <br>For more information on the semi-finalists and other proposals that were submitted, visit the City of Tomorrow Challenge website. | 28/11/2018 16:56:49 |

| Mayor Peduto Signs Contract with Paramedics Union | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4369_EMS_contract.jpg)<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (December 6, 2018) Mayor William Peduto today signed a new contract with Fraternal Association of Professional Paramedics Local 1. <br>“This agreement will place more medic units – and provide increased public safety – on Pittsburgh streets on a 24/7 basis, while keeping our promises on financial stability,” Mayor Peduto said. <br>The contract adopts 12-hour shifts for paramedics and emergency medical technicians over two week periods, replacing the former schedule of six consecutive days of eight hour shifts. The change should provide fewer demands of forced overtime on Emergency Medical Services personnel, and allow the City to better manage overtime pay, creating more predictability in scheduling and wages for both union members and management. <br>The expanded shifts should allow for the return of 24/7 service out of medic units in Brighton Heights, Homewood and Hays. Three EMT stations will also have 24/7 service restored. Wage and longevity payments included in the contract are within the parameters of the City’s 5-year financial plan. <br>“One of my goals over the past two years has been to boost the morale within our EMS bureau while increasing services to city residents. This agreement should do both,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. <br>The one-year contract starting January 1, 2019 has an option for a five year extension, after a review of the contract’s impact on overtime payments (also called “premium pay”). The union must also agree to the five year extension. <br>“I really appreciate what the Mayor and the City are doing for us with this contract,” said Jeffrey M. Tremel, president of FAPP Local 1. <br>Union membership approved the contract Wednesday evening in a 129-28 vote. <br>_City of Pittsburgh photo: FAPP Local 1 President Jeffrey M.

| Peduto Administration Reasserts Commitments to Affordable Housing and Equitable Neighborhood Development | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 10, 2018) The Peduto Administration is committed to working with all interested parties to support affordable housing in the city, as well as to boost neighborhood development by helping community groups to grow. <br>Budget proposals for the Urban Redevelopment Authority do not undercut equitable development and affordable housing as some have erroneously claimed.  <br>The 2019 budget includes a new commitment of $1.5 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) dollars to affordable housing in the Bedford Dwellings/Hill District Choice Neighborhood program. An additional $1.5 million is going to the Larimer Choice Neighborhoods initiative. <br>That spending is going up while federal support is going down: federal HOME dollars are being reduced by $800,000 next year, from $2.3 million last year to $1.5 million in 2019.  <br>For the first time in the City’s history, no CDBG monies are being used for street paving, precisely due to Mayor Peduto’s pledge not to apportion monies that can otherwise be used for equitable development initiatives. Instead, $19 million budgeted for paving in 2019 is coming from bond dollars, which cannot legally be used for the URA. <br>The administration is always willing to work with City Council and other partners on budget solutions and changes, and is in the process of doing so on affordable housing and other matters.  <br>It will do so in an open and transparent manner, just as the City introduced changes to its support of community groups this year. <br>Misinformation about the City’s ordinance on Registered Community Organizations (RCOs) has been rampant in social media and elsewhere. RCOs are commonly supported by Planning Departments in cities including Philadelphia, Salt Lake City and San Diego, and in Pittsburgh will help level the playing field for all community groups seeking to help their neighborhoods. <br>Despite erroneous claims to the contrary the RCO legislation:  <br>- Supports such groups by requiring for the first time that developers meet with community organizations <br>- Was the subject – prior to its drafting – of input from focus groups citywide throughout 2016-2017, with the help of PCRG and Neighborhood Allies <br>- Includes technical assistance for RCOs through a contract with Bayer Center for Non-profit Management, which will help community groups with websites and their governance documents <br>- Allows for multiple RCOs in the same geographical area <br>- Requires all RCOs to be registered nonprofits, have bylaws, hold meetings in ADA-accessible locations, have transparent board selection processes, have websites and adopt non-discrimination policies <br>The City, and the RCO legislation, support neighborhood groups and the work they do on behalf of residents and their communities, and gives them the resources to do their work even better. This effort empowers community groups and legislates the community’s voice into City law. | 10/12/2018 15:56:49 |
| Electronic and Hazardous Waste Recycling Bill Being Introduced to City Council | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 10, 2018) City residents will be able to responsibly recycle electronic and hazardous waste in a cost-effective manner, under a contract being introduced to Pittsburgh City Council tomorrow. <br>Electronic waste (or “e-waste”), such as televisions and computers, often contains lead and mercury. E-waste has been banned from Pennsylvania landfills since 2010, leaving residents with few reasonable options to responsibly recycle. <br>Under the legislation being introduced tomorrow the City Department of Public Works would contract with [Environmental Coordination Services & Recycling Inc](http://www.ecsr.net/) to provide both curbside and drop-off options for residents seeking to recycle both e-waste and household hazardous waste, including paint and chemicals. The service would begin in January. <br>Without such recycling options, the waste often is left abandoned on curbsides or is dumped illegally. This program, which arises from legislation introduced by Councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith and former Councilman (and current mayoral Chief of Staff) Dan Gilman, seeks to provide residents with dependable and responsible ways to dispose of the material. <br>Mayor William Peduto supports the measure. <br>“This legislation is good for residents and for our neighborhoods, especially as it should cut down on illegal dumping,” Councilwoman Kail-Smith said. “I want to thank Mayor Peduto, Mr. Gilman and all those in the Department of Public Works for their support.” <br>E-waste and hazardous waste have to be recycled in an environmentally sound manner that complies with state and federal law, and thus requires fees for proper disposal. Proposed prices for disposing most TVs and computers will be 40 cents per pound, so the typical fee for recycling a 50 pound TV will be an estimated $20. <br>Residents will have the option of dropping off such materials twice a week (on Wednesdays and Sundays) at the DPW facility at 3001 Railroad Street in the Strip District. Residents will be allowed to pull in to the facility, have their waste weighed, and charged a recycling fee that can be paid with a check or credit card. <br>Neighborhood recycling events will be scheduled around the city, and home pick-up will also be offered for a $50 fee, in addition to the cost per pound of material. <br>The City’s proposed contract with ECS&R is for $210,000. | 10/12/2018 10:22:30 |

| Major Improvements Planned for Homewood Neighborhood Business District | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 11, 2018) A major network of pedestrian improvements in Homewood will make it easier for residents to walk to school, work and public transit through a resolution going before the board of the Urban Redevelopment Authority this week. <br>The board is set to vote Thursday on a $674,171 contract with M and B Services for the construction of the Homewood Pedestrian Improvement plan.

| Leaders Forward Package of Common Sense Gun Safety Measures | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 14, 2018) Demanding strong action against the proliferation of guns tearing apart Pittsburgh and other communities nationwide, City of Pittsburgh leaders today released a trio of common-sense measures meant to make city streets, schools, places of worship and families safer.<br>Governor Tom Wolf and Mayor William Peduto joined City Council members Corey O’Connor and Erika Strassburger – who together represent Squirrel Hill, site of the massacre of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue Oct. 27 – to unveil three bills that will be introduced to Council on Tuesday.<br>They include:<br>- An assault weapons ban making it unlawful to man manufacture, sell, purchase, transport, carry, store, or otherwise hold in one’s possession an assault weapon within the City, such as the Colt AR-15 automatic rifle used in the Tree of Life shooting<br>- An accessories, ammunition and modification ban barring items such as bump stocks, armor-penetrating bullets, sawed-off rifles and large capacity magazines often used in mass shootings<br>- Adoption of Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs), which enable courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having guns if law enforcement or immediate family members show that the individual poses a significant danger<br>Joined by gun violence victims, advocates and state leaders, the leaders announced the measures today on the anniversary of the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, massacre of 26 schoolchildren and staff. The bills will be subject to weeks of debates and hearings with the hope they can be approved by February 14, 2019, the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting of 17 schoolchildren and staff in Parkland, Florida.<br>Mayor Peduto has asked cities around the country to support Pittsburgh’s measures and/or introduce similar legislation to create nationwide momentum behind the critically needed gun changes. Councilperson Strassburger and Councilman O'Connor are reaching out to municipalities across Pennsylvania to encourage them to adopt similar provisions.<br>“I stand in solidarity with all those in Pittsburgh and across the commonwealth looking to make their communities safer,” Governor Wolf said. “Earlier this year, I signed the first major gun safety bill in decades in Pennsylvania. It was long overdue, but we still have a lot of work to do, in Harrisburg and in Washington. I’ll continue to champion commonsense gun safety at the state level and urge Washington to live up to its responsibilities.”<br>“No one in America wants a country where guns make our schools unsafe for children, families afraid in places of worship, and where our streets are stained every day with innocent blood,” Mayor Peduto said. “The morality we all share, across every race, gender, ethnicity, region and religion, compels us to take action.”<br>“As gun violence escalates across the country, it would be unconscionable for me to stand by and do nothing,” said Councilman O’Connor, who crafted the gun legislation package. “I believe we are on the right side of history here and must seize the opportunity to make a real difference by partnering with other municipalities in the Commonwealth and cities across America to enact common sense gun reforms.”    <br>"As an elected leader, my most important duty is keeping my constituents and communities safe. This legislation will help to prevent military grade weapons from reaching the hands of dangerous individuals," said Councilperson Strassburger, who co-sponsored the legislation. <br>"The Pennsylvania Constitution guarantees the rights of all people to 'peace, safety and happiness.' The inability for municipal governments to enact their own common sense gun control measures defies this core principle. I hope more cities across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the entire nation will join Pittsburgh in this critical effort." <br>Copies are available here of the legislation on [assault weapons](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4414_General_Firearm_Conduct.pdf), [accessories/modifications](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4412_Accessories_Ammoand_Modifications_Ban.pdf), and [ERPOs](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4413_Extreme_Risk_Protection_Orders.pdf).<br>### | 14/12/2018 09:36:42 |

Opportunities like this provide not just the ability to address our affordable housing need, but additionally decreases urban blight in Pittsburgh. A partnership like this helps us ensure that Pittsburgh remains a city for all,” said Mayor William Peduto. <br>“Thanks to this generous NSP award from the Commonwealth, the URA, City of Pittsburgh and our community development partners will be able to turn 35 vacant and abandoned houses into affordable homeownership opportunities for Pittsburgh’s residents,” said Robert Rubinstein, URA executive director.  <br>In partnership with the URA, the City will procure, reconstruct, and resell 35 abandon or foreclosed homes, with a  focus in areas that have the greatest need in the city.  After the houses are restored, the properties will be sold to buyers at or below 120 percent of the area median income. Additionally, twenty-five percent of the properties will be reserved to be sold to buyers with at or below 50 percent of the area median income.  <br>NSP provides grants to communities to address the housing foreclosure crisis created by subprime and other problematic mortgage lending. This program is authorized under the federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. In addition to promoting affordable housing, the grants also help address blight issues resulting from these abandoned or foreclosed homes. | 17/12/2018 14:42:33 |
| PLI Launches Online Licensing Website | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 18, 2018) The Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections (PLI) has launched online business licensing, making it easier to open and operate a business in Pittsburgh. This is the first portion of the OneStopPGH project that will bring the City’s development and property maintenance process online over the coming year.<br>Customers can now apply for, renew, and amend all types of business and trade licenses online. Citizens can also [look up existing business license holders](https://onestoppgh.pittsburghpa.gov/pghprod/pub/lms/Default.aspx?PosseMenuName=PC_Search) via name, address or license number. The site is in beta testing and will be continually improved to enhance customer experiences. <br>Visit the [OneStopPGH website](http://pittsburghpa.gov/onestoppgh/) to learn more about the ongoing project, including [instructional videos](http://pittsburghpa.gov/onestoppgh/phase-one.html) on how to set up an account. <br>“PLI is excited to provide more efficient and convenient services to our customers online,” said PLI Director Maura Kennedy. “Today’s beta launch is the culmination of a lot of effort by our Department to better meet the needs of a 21st century Pittsburgh. In less than five years, PLI went from processing licenses by hand via paper to a fully online electronic system.”<br>The online licensing launch is part of a larger licensing overhaul by the Department. Earlier this year, PLI rewrote the City’s business licensing code for the first time since the 1980s and recalibrated license fees based on a study of associated Departmental time and costs. Visit [pittsburghpa.gov/pli/licenses](http://pittsburghpa.gov/pli/licenses) to learn more.<br>Some of the key changes in the legislation include:<br>- Standardizing insurance limits and requirements across license types<br>- Eliminating redundant license types<br>- Creating a new fire suppression contractor license (effective Jan. 1 2019.)  From that date on, fire suppression permits may only be issued to those license holders.  Existing permits can be completed by the previously named contractor.<br>- Requiring trade license holders to earn 8 hours of CEUs annually to renew their license.  A list of what is accepted as a CEU and when they must be completed can be [found on the PLI website](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/4196_2018_2019_PLI_Continuing_Education_Units_(CEU)_Guidance.pdf).<br>Today’s online business licensing launch the first of a four part project to bring all of Pittsburgh’s development processes online, making it easier to live and work in the City. PLI and Department of City Planning permitting will go online in the Summer of 2019, with Department of Mobility and Infrastructure and Fire Bureau permits to follow in the Winter of 2019. | 18/12/2018 11:15:48 |

| Reminder: City Expands Annual Christmas Tree Recycling Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 26, 2018) The City of Pittsburgh is expanding its Christmas Tree Recycling program this year by providing ten drop-off locations for trees. <br>The program gives residents the ability to have their trees recycled rather than sent to a landfill, which happens when they are left at the curb. <br>Only two drop-off sites were available last year. This year ten sites are available for tree drop-off for one month, from December 26 to January 26. (Three of the sites are DPW facilities that take yard waste year-round.)  <br>All ornaments, netting, tinsel and tree stands must be removed from the tree before it is dropped off. <br>The Forestry and Environmental Services divisions within the Department of Public Works are collaborating to chip the trees into pine mulch, which will be made available to the public for free this spring.  <br>The tree recycling program also dovetails with the city’s [Climate Action Plan](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/645_PCAP_3.0_Presentation.pdf), which has a zero waste goal. <br>Residents may call 311 [or visit the website here for more information](http://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/xmas-tree-recycling). The website features a map to help residents find their most convenient drop-off location. <br>Three DPW sites are available year-round for yard debris (including Christmas tree) drop-off, from 8 a.m.-1 p.m. Monday through Saturday. They are: <br>_Hazelwood_<br>3rd Division of Public Works  <br>Melanchton Avenue off 5200 block of 2nd Avenue  <br>412-422-6524 <br>_Homewood West_<br>2nd Division of Public Works  <br>North Dallas Avenue at Hamilton Avenue  <br>412-665-3609 <br>_Elliott_<br>5th Division of Public Works  <br>1330 Hassler Street off Herschel & Steuben streets (near Herschel Park) \| <br>412-937-3054 <br>The seven other drop-off locations will be open 24 hours a day from December 26, 2018-January 26, 2019.
