# Fire Safe Building Ordinance

In 2016, City Council passed the Fire Safe Buildings Ordinance, requiring periodic testing and inspections of fire safety systems for some building owners.

The Ordinance requires that all tests and inspections of fire and smoke dampers are completed by individuals "who are certified to inspect and test fire and Smoke Dampers and hold certification from the International Certification Board as a HVAC Fire Life Safety Technician through a program accredited by ANSI under the ISO/IEC 17024 standard."

The Ordinance also requires that all tests and inspections of Smoke Control Systems are completed by individuals who "have obtained air balancer certifications from the International Certification Board as a HVAC Fire Life Safety Technician through a program accredited by ANSI under the ISO/IEC 17024 standard."
