**Council Passes Housing Opportunity Fund**

Published: 12/20/2016

Councilman Lavelle legislated the creation of a Housing Opportunity Fund for the city of Pittsburgh. The ordinance requires the city to set aside a minimum of $10 million each year for the creation and preservation of affordable housing. The fund will help stabilize and foster mixed-income neighborhoods, encouraging newcomers and helping long-timers stay put amid higher property values, taxes and market pressures. Aid offerings could include down-payment assistance, home rehabilitation and foreclosure prevention.
