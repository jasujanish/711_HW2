# Fire Suppression Trade License

A Fire Suppression Trade License is required to install, erect, enlarge, repair, alter, remove, convert, or replace any fire suppression systems within the City of Pittsburgh. Cooking hood work does not require a Fire Suppression Trade License.

Trade licenses are issued for the purposes of verifying an individual's qualifications for performing trade work. Trade licenses are issued to indivuals, not companies. In order to obtain permits, trade license holders must further provide a tax compliance letter from the City Finance Department, a certificate of general liability insurance, and evidence of worker's comp insurance or an affidavit of exemption, as outlined in our Rules and Regulations.
