# Action Teams

Action Teams are comprised of residents, students, employees, property owners, agencies, and professionals interested in working to develop projects and programs for the neighborhood plan. They are an opportunity for building partnerships while developing feasible action items for the plan. Action Teams engage the broader community on their topic, conduct studies, look at best practices, and shape recommendations. Action Teams are formed for each of the four chapters of the plan: community, development, mobility, and infrastructure. Learn more about these topic areas in the [Neighborhood Plan Guide](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/City-Planning/Neighborhood-Planning/Neighborhood-Plan-Guide).

Action Teams for the Oakland Plan will begin in Fall 2020 and be conducted using Zoom and the City of Pittsburghâ€™s online engagement portal, [Engage PGH](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/). Regular meetings will be scheduled throughout the next year. Action Team members are expected to attend all meetings over the course of a year.
