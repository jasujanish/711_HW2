**Candidate Background Processing Form**

Office of Municipal Investigations:

The City of Pittsburgh, as a matter of policy, conducts a pre-employment and promotional background investigation on all applicants being considered for positions. Applicants may be disqualified from consideration based on the results of their background investigation (as it relates to the job the applicant is being considered for).

* * *

**Drug Screen:**

The drug screening test will include, but is not limited to, a hair sample analysis. It is therefore important that you have at least a half inch of hair (in length) on your head that the clinicians can cut for this sample. If your head hair is too short, body hair can be used as a substitute.

All firefighter recruit applicants with the City of Pittsburgh, Bureau of Fire are subject to a thorough background investigation to verify the accuracy of statements provided within the applicant materials and to confirm qualification for employment. The background information is reviewed by the Chief and his/her command staff for selection purposes.

Keep the following information in mind:

-  It takes approximately one month to grow a half inch of hair.
-  Head and body hair do not grow at the same rate.
-  Body hair grows at a much slower rate.

* * *

**Chief’s Selection:**

The Fire Chief reviews all background files and may decertify a candidate based upon the information contained in the file.

* * *

**Public Hearing Process:**

Any applicant who is passed over for just cause and disqualified from becoming a Firefighter Recruit for the City of Pittsburgh can request an appeal hearing within ten days of the date of the disqualification notice. The request must be made in writing to the Secretary & chief Examiner for the City of Pittsburgh. Once the request is received the Appellant will be assigned a hearing date. The Appellant may hire an attorney, or represent themselves. After hearing testimony, and reviewing the evidence presented the Civil Service Commission will make a determination to deny, or grant, the appeal request. Please email all requests to: [charlene.holder@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:charlene.holder@pittsburghpa.gov).

Candidates will be given a conditional offer of employment. If the candidate accepts, you will then be scheduled to take a medical (stress test) examination.
