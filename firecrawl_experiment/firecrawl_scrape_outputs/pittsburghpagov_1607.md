# Geographic Information System (GIS) & Mapping

Welcome to GIS at the Department of Innovation and Performance of the City of Pittsburgh!

GIS is a dynamic technology that combines spatial or geographic data with mapping and analytical tools, helping city departments efficiently manage infrastructure, plan urban development, respond to emergencies, and optimize public services.

Our team harnesses the power of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to drive smarter city operations, provide data-driven insights, and enhance services for residents, businesses, and visitors. Through interactive web applications, we ensure spatial data is easily accessible to both internal departments and the public, fostering transparency and efficiency.

Our goal is to deliver innovative solutions that support a smarter, more connected Pittsburgh.

Some of the ways GIS is used in the City of Pittsburgh include:

- Mapping public assets such as roads, utilities, and parks
- Supporting emergency response and public safety planning
- Assisting in zoning, land use planning, and permitting
- Improving transportation and transit planning
- Tracking environmental data and sustainability initiatives
