## What are the codes and regulations administered?

The City of Pittsburgh Zoning Code regulates land use and activities within the City boundaries. The intent of zoning regulations is to allow property owners the reasonable use of their property insofar as the use is not detrimental to abutting properties or to the neighborhood. The City of Pittsburgh is divided into different Zoning Districts that regulate the potential uses of a property. [Interactive maps](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Geographic-Information-Systems-Mapping-Open-Data/Geographic-Information-System-GIS-Mapping/Interactive-Apps-Maps-Dashboards) show the zoning and parcel information.
