# Applicant Guidance

The table below lists DOMI’s permits, licenses, and plan reviews. You can find a permit, license, or plan review type by browsing the table below or by using the search function. For example, if you wanted to find the City’s Barricade Permit, you could search for barricade, permit, construction, or staging.

The table includes links to information sheets or webpages that provide more details about specific permits, licenses, and plan reviews.

Additionally, the following documents outline information about DOMI’s processes and business practices, such as procedures and standards pertaining to working in the public right-of-way (ROW), fees and how they are calculated, required inspections and what they entail, and more.
