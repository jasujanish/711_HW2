## Approval Process

Once a permit application completes the "Completeness Check" review process in OneStopPGH, the application enters into application review. The below steps illustrate the typical process an application takes from submission to a issuing a permit.

### Step 1.City Planning review

After Completeness Check is accepted, a Zoning reviewer and Historic Preservation reviewer are assigned to review the application. Historic Preservation staff have been authorized by the Historic Review Commission (HRC) to approve certain kinds of projects over-the-counter and may therefore be able to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) administratively.

The HRC must review all applications that staff are not able to approve over-the counter. Historic Preservation staff will contact you to schedule a HRC meeting date once the application has been reviewed and determined to be a complete application. Incomplete applications may delay project review and required hearings.

### Step 2. _Historic Review Commission Briefing_

_If **applicable based on application type**. For projects proposing demolition and / or new construction, City Planning recommends a briefing. Public comment is not taken during a briefing and no Commission decision is issued._

### Step 3. _Development Activities Meeting_

_If the **proposed location is within a Registered Community Organization,** a Development Activities Meeting (DAM) is required 30 days before the Historic Review Commission (HRC) meeting date. City Planning staff will contact you with DAM scheduling information._

### Step 4. _Zoning Board of Adjustment Meeting_

_If a proposed project **requires approval by the ZBA,** the ZBA meeting and decision must be issued prior to scheduling a HRC meeting date._

### Step 5.Historic Review Commission Public Meeting

The HRC meets on the first Wednesday of each month. Meetings start at 1:00 pm and are hybrid. Agendas for HRC meetings are posted 10 days prior to the meeting date. The Commission will vote to approve, postpone, or deny the proposed application.
