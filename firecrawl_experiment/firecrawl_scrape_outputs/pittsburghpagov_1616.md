[How to Apply](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/City-Planning/Historic-Preservation-Program/Apply-for-Historic-Designation#panel-1-1) [Approval Process](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/City-Planning/Historic-Preservation-Program/Apply-for-Historic-Designation#panel-1-2)

## How to Apply

A property's owner of record or any person presently residing in the City of Pittsburgh who has established residency in the City for at least one year may submit a historic nomination. Please note that a nomination of a religious structure may not be possible and historic district nominations are subject to additional requirements.

### Step 1.Review Nomination Criteria

At least one of the ten criteria listed in the Historic Preservation Code must be met for Historic Designation. Review the list of Criteria prior to starting a nomination application. The list of Criteria is available under Supporting Documents.

### Step 2.Create a OneStopPGH account

Visit OneStopPGH to create an account. All submissions and review comments are organized through your OneStopPGH account and application record number.

### Step 3.Complete and Submit Application

Complete the Historic Nomination application, submit to OneStopPGH, and pay the applicable fee. Historic Nomination applications are under Planning Applications -> Historic Nomination Application. Fees are non-refundable. The downloadable application and fee schedule are available within the side panel on this webpage.

### Step 4.Application Review

Once submitted to OneStopPGH, staff will review the nomination for correctness and completeness. Additional information may be required if staff determines the application is incomplete. A nomination is accepted for review once Historic Preservation staff completes the "Completeness Check" review process in OneStopPGH. Once Completeness Check is accepted and the application moves into staff review, City Planning staff will notify the applicant via email.

Upon accepting the application, staff will also notify the property owner of record of the Nomination via mail.

_Note: Per Section 1101.03 of the Historic Preservation Code, no demolition permit shall be issued for a nominated structure, site, or object beginning with the date of receipt of an accepted nomination form. The date of receipt is the date Completeness Check is accepted._

## Approval Process

Once a Historic Nomination application completes the "Completeness Check" review process in OneStopPGH, the application enters into application review. The below steps illustrate the typical public meeting process an application takes from submission to a City Council decision.

### Step 1.Development Activities Meeting (if applicable)

If the proposed Nomination is within a Registered Community Organization, a Development Activities Meeting (DAM) is required 30 days before the first Historic Review Commission (HRC) public hearing.

### Step 2.Historic Review Commission Preliminary Review Meeting

Per Section 1101.03 of the Historic Preservation Code, City Planning staff shall schedule a meeting for the HRC to make a preliminary determination concerning the nomination, deciding if there is reasonable cause to determine the application meets the definitions for a district, structure, site, or object. A short presentation by the applicant is requested. Meetings are held in-person and virtually. If approved, the application is scheduled for a Public Hearing

### Step 3.Historic Review Commission Public Meeting

At the HRC public meeting, the Commission will consider the nomination. HRC hears testimony from the nominator, City staff, the property owner, and general public. If considered favorably, the Commission provides a recommendation to City Council. Meetings are held in-person and virtually.

_Note: Per Section 1101.03 of the Historic Preservation Code, the Commission shall schedule a public hearing with three months following receipt of a completed nomination form._

### Step 4.Planning Commission Public Meeting

In addition to Historic Review Commission, nominations are also considered by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission will hear public testimony and if considered favorably, the Planning Commission provides a recommendation to City Council. Historic Preservation staff will work with the applicant on scheduling a Planning Commission meeting date. Meetings are held in-person and virtually.

### Step 5.City Council Public Meeting

City Council holds a public meeting on the proposed nomination. City Planning staff will work with the applicant on scheduling a meeting date. Meetings are held in-person and virtually.

### Step 6.City Council Review

City Council makes the final decision regarding whether a property or district is worthy of historic designation. If approved, the property or district will be listed on the City register.

### Step 7.After City Council Review

If City Council approves a historic nomination, all external alterations to an individually listed property or those in a historic district are subject to review and approval by Historic Preservation Staff or the Historic Review Commission, depending on the scope of work. Violations are subject to citation by the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections and are treated the same as any building code violation.
