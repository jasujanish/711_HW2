# Bed and Breakfast License

The City of Pittsburgh requires an annual Bed and Breakfast License for anyone who owns or operates a Bed and Breakfast Establishment within the City of Pittsburgh. A Bed and Breakfast is defined as a small lodging establishment that offers overnight accommodations where the owner-operator lives on premises.  Inspections that accompany a Bed and Breakfast License are to insure there are no IPMC violations, and that the property is in compliance with the Certificate of Occupancy (including parking lots.) For a comprehensive definition and list of requirements, please see [Chapter 767: Bed and Breakfast Establishments](https://ecode360.com/45465263#45465263) in the City Code and the PLI [Rules and Regulations.](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/pli/documents/licensing_rules_regulations.pdf)
