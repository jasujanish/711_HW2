| Mayor William Peduto Signs Executive Order on Responsible Contracting | Order supports qualified contractors and job training efforts<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (July 26, 2017) Mayor William Peduto today signed an Executive Order to support the local construction industry and new job training opportunities in Pittsburgh.  <br>The Responsible Contracting order calls for a creation of a labor-management task force that will study ways to: <br>- Assist new businesses that want to invest in the city <br>- Support redevelopment in under-served neighborhoods <br>- Connect reputable contractors with local construction opportunities <br>- Connect local residents with the training necessary to find good-paying jobs in the construction industry <br>The Mayor was joined at a press conference today announcing the Order with members of the Builders Guild of Western Pennsylvania and local developers. <br>The Order says in part: <br>WHEREAS To ensure public health and safety, safeguard City resources and investments and protect consumers of construction services from unqualified and disreputable firms, Pittsburgh would benefit from developing effective licensing, procurement and economic development policies, including the use of clearly defined technical qualification and contractor responsibility standards to address the unique challenges of the industry and ensure participation by competent, law-abiding contractors and properly trained craft workers. <br>As for training, the Order states: <br>WHEREAS, Pittsburgh, like that of many other municipalities, is facing serious skill shortages in construction due to shifting demographics, mass retirement of baby boomers and other factors; and such shortages will become increasingly worse without proactive policy solutions, which will severely undermine the City’s ability to ensure a sufficient pool of competent contractors and an adequate supply of skilled labor to meet project needs; and <br>WHEREAS, This Administration also recognizes that, notwithstanding generally strong economic trends in Pittsburgh in recent years, there are still a substantial number of under-employed and unemployed residents who, with proper education and training, could help the City meet its demand for skilled workers on future projects. <br>A copy of the full order [is available here.](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/mayorpeduto/Final_Safe_Responsible_Contractor_Executive_Order_(2).pdf) | 2/8/2017 09:25:59 |

| Overnight Lane Restrictions on Parkway East Begin Monday Night | PITTSBURGH, PA (August 4, 2017) - The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works advises that weeknight lane restrictions on I-376 East (Parkway East) -- in the vicinity of the Greenfield Bridge -- will begin on Monday, August 7, 2017.  <br>PennDOT has approved the restrictions for weeknights from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. starting August 7, through September 5, 2017. Inbound and outbound single lane closures between Greenfield/Squirrel Hill and Oakland exits on I-376 East will be intermittent depending on weather and contractor schedule. Motorists using I-376 East should expect delays and drive with caution when overnight lane restrictions are in place.   <br>Lane restrictions are necessary to ensure safety for commuters and crews while work on the Greenfield Bridge reconstruction project continues, including painting and the removal of any remnant bracing pieces and equipment over the Parkway East. <br>Additional information on the Greenfield Bridge Project can be found on the Oakland Transportation Management Association’s (OTMA) community outreach website ( [http://greenfieldbridge.otmapgh.org/](http://greenfieldbridge.otmapgh.org/)).   <br>Questions concerning the overnight restrictions should be directed to Aaron Pickering, Project Manager of Michael Baker International, at 412-269-6423, or via e-mail to [Apickering@mbakerintl.com](mailto:Apickering@mbakerintl.com). | 11/8/2017 12:24:09 |

| Planned Bike Lane Installation in North Oakland To Begin Tuesday | ITTSBURGH, PA (August 11, 2017) - The City of Pittsburgh Departments of Mobility and Infrastructure and Public Works advise that the installation of bike lanes on portions of Forbes Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard in North Oakland will begin on Tuesday, August 15, 2017.  <br>Installation is expected to last one to two weeks and is weather dependent. Streets will remain open to traffic but road users should expect changing traffic patterns. Port Authority bus stops will remain active through the work area.  <br>**Forbes Avenue** is currently a 4 lane, one way road with heavy traffic and lacks a safe route for cyclists comminuting through the university campuses. The Forbes Avenue project will add bike lanes in both directions on [Forbes Avenue from Bigelow Boulevard to Craig Street](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/mayorpeduto/Forbes_interim_lanes_board.pdf), connecting the University of Pittsburgh, Schenley Plaza, the Bayard Street bike lanes and Oakland’s two business districts (Forbes Avenue and Craig Street.) City of Pittsburgh officials, including Mayor Peduto and District 8 Councilman Dan Gilman, have been working closely with PennDOT, the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and other community stakeholders to ensure that ongoing improvements to the Fifth/Forbes Avenue corridor will create a safer environment for all residents and roadway users. <br>Adjacent to Forbes Avenue, **Bigelow Boulevard** between Fifth Avenue and Forbes Avenue is a block-long gap in the existing bicycle network. The City of Pittsburgh has been working closely with the University of Pittsburgh on the short-term and long-term designs for this block. The 2017 installation of bike lanes and reconfiguration of the street is the first step towards a long term, complete streets vision for this portion of Bigelow Boulevard.  <br>Costs associated with the Forbes Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard bike lane projects are allocated from the 2017 City of Pittsburgh Capital Budget funds. The total cost of materials (pavement marking installation, flex posts) for both projects is approximately $45,000. Work is scheduled to be completed by the end of August 2017. Bicycle signals are included in the project but will be installed at a later date. <br>The Oakland neighborhood, Pittsburgh’s second largest job center, has a high concentration of people riding bicycles due to its job density, high student population and density of destinations. The added bicycle facilities are part of an overall transportation network plan. <br>### | 11/8/2017 12:23:49 |

| Statement By Mayor William Peduto on President Trump Ending DACA Immigration Program | **PITTSBURGH, PA** (September 5, 2017) Mayor William Peduto released the following statement regarding the decision by President Donald Trump to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects 800,000 immigrants brought to the United States as children from deportation:  <br>"President Trump's decision today is pathologically cruel and a tragic repudiation of fundamental American values.  <br>The President's decision is ethically, legally and economically wrong. It puts the futures of nearly 1 million people at risk, more than 90 percent of whom are valuable members of the nation's workforce. It further squanders two centuries of trust in the American ideal, and the unalienable rights of all to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is reckless and unforgivable. <br>It sets a very dangerous and chilling precedent. Those in DACA came forward and voluntarily registered with the federal government, and they are now facing the fact that federal officials may use that personal information against them.  <br>Despite this action I want all immigrants living in Pittsburgh – working here, studying here, raising a family here -- to know that I and others will do all we can to protect you. Our city was built by generations who came before you, and you will help us grow and thrive for generations to come. This is your city, and you are welcome here. <br>Pittsburgh is a member of the Dream Coalition, a nationwide effort of government officials, CEOs, faith leaders and others working to preserve and protect DACA and Dreamers. The City will join in legal and legislative efforts to preserve this program, and the promises the United States have made to undocumented immigrants brought here as children. This fight is not over." | 5/9/2017 12:20:13 |

| Mayor William Peduto Featured Speaker at Congressional Briefing on Resilience and Extreme Weather | **Mayor William Peduto Featured Speaker at Congressional Briefing on Resilience and Extreme Weather**<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (September 11, 2017) Mayor William Peduto is in Washington D.C. today, where he will speak at a Congressional briefing on resilience and extreme weather. <br>The afternoon briefing is being hosted by the National League of Cities and the Environmental and Energy Institute. The Mayor will speak on the resilience strategies Pittsburgh has adopted since being named one of the Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities in 2014. <br>"In Pittsburgh, resilience means planning for long-term threats to our residents, whether they be environmental or economic, and the short-term threats that increasingly face cities nationwide. We must do all we can to study and prepare for the shocks that come with climate change and economic disruption, and particularly their out-sized impacts on our most vulnerable neighbors," the Mayor said. <br>The City's ONE PGH Resilient Pittsburgh strategy document [is available here](http://pittsburghpa.gov/onepgh/index.html). <br>Today's briefing, entitled "How Can Cities Become More Resilient to Extreme Weather?," is being held from 3-4:30 p.m. in Room 122, Cannon House Office Building. It is set for live-streaming at [www.eesi.org/livecast](http://www.eesi.org/livecast). <br>The Mayor and two other panelists – Flagstaff, Ariz., sustainability manager Nicole Antonopoulos Woodman and Sustainable Cities Institute program director Cooper Martin – will discuss ways cities can reduce their vulnerability to extreme weather and the impacts of weather events. <br>The main audience for the briefing is Congressional staff, federal agencies, public interest groups, industry leaders, academics and others.  <br>NLC/EESI describes the panel this way: <br>_Mayors are on the front lines when natural disasters and other catastrophic events threaten lives and property. The National League of Cities (NLC) and the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) invite you to a briefing about what cities throughout the United States are doing to protect their communities by investing in resilience. Infrastructure dollars are only part of the story. Equally important is funding for planning that accounts for new weather patterns with more severe impacts than we’ve seen in the past and preemptive action to keep people and structures safe and functional.

| City Launching Public Safety Multicultural Liaison Unit To Work With Immigrant and Refugee Communities | City Launching Public Safety Multicultural Liaison Unit to Work with Immigrant and Refugee Communities <br>PITTSBURGH, PA (September 11, 2017) The City of Pittsburgh is launching a Multicultural Liaison Unit to help build trustworthy and sustainable relationships between Department of Public Safety workers and members of the city's immigrant and refugee communities. <br>The unit will translate police, fire and medic materials into several foreign languages, hold educational events for immigrant communities, and provide multicultural training for Public Safety recruits. <br>The MLU is a community policing recommendation in the Welcoming Pittsburgh plan released by Mayor William Peduto in 2014. It will be comprised of members of the Mayor's Bureau of Neighborhood Empowerment, the Department of Public Safety and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. This team will work closely with members of the Welcoming Pittsburgh Advisory Committee to ensure consistent community input and community-driven solutions.  <br>Legislation to accept $50,000 in grant funding to underwrite the MLU is being introduced to City Council Tuesday. <br>The MLU will focus on 3 major initiatives: <br>1. Communication and Language Access <br>   <br>2. Outreach and Education <br>   <br>3. Multicultural Trainings <br>   <br>**Communication and Language Access**: Public Safety literature will be translated and distributed as well as “Watch and Learn” videos that will explain basic laws and protocol in various languages and will feature Public Safety employees from Police, Fire, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Both the videos and documents will be translated into the 5 most common foreign languages in the city. They are: <br>- Arabic   <br>  <br>- Chinese <br>  <br>- Nepalese  <br>  <br>- Spanish  <br>  <br>- Swahili  <br>  <br>**Outreach and Education**: Both outreach and education are seen as vital for Public Safety employees to build connections and trust within the community. Events such as “Know Your Rights Sessions,” “Immigrant and Refugee Public Safety Academy” and more will be held within the region of the specific immigrant and refugee populations. <br>**Multicultural Trainings**: Multicultural training will be incorporated into the new recruit training for each of the Public Safety bureaus. These trainings will help first responders effectively address and support the public safety needs of residents with various cultural backgrounds and limited English language skills. The objective is to help officers understand, respect and appropriately respond to cultural norms when interacting with immigrant and refugee community members.  <br>The MLU will also conduct community discussion forums and social engagement events in different parts of the city.  <br>The launch of the MLU was made possible by a generous donation by the Heinz Endowments.  <br>For more information about the MLU initiative, please visit the [Welcoming Pittsburgh Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/WelcomingPGH/).<br>Contact: Commander Eric Holmes at [eric.holmes@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:eric.holmes@pittsburghpa.gov) or 412-323-7814, or Assistant Director of Public Safety Shatara Murphy, shatara.murphy@pittsburghpa.gov or 412-255-2374. | 11/9/2017 12:28:54 |
| Installation of Cycle Track in Allegheny Circle to Begin This Week | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 12, 2017) - The City of Pittsburgh Departments of Mobility and Infrastructure and Public Works, in partnership with the Buhl Foundation, are pleased to announce that the installation of a two-way [cycle track](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/cycle-tracks/two-way-cycle-tracks/) around Allegheny Circle in Allegheny Center (Northside) is scheduled to begin the week of September 12, 2017. The cycle track will connect existing cycling infrastructure on Federal Street, East Ohio Street, and Ridge Avenue and is the first phase of the proposed reconstruction of Allegheny Circle.<br>"The failed design of Allegheny Circle as a four-lane, high speed ring road has needed improvements like this for decades," said Mayor William Peduto. "This redesign will further enhance the ongoing transformation of Allegheny Center into a hub for 21st Century infrastructure and development in the Northside. Phase One is a great start and next year we will bring federal funding to the table to complete the transformation of the 'circle' to a multimodal, pedestrian friendly urban street." <br>Allegheny Circle is currently a four-lane, one-way ring road circling the mid-century redevelopment of Allegheny Center. In 2016, the City of Pittsburgh engaged several stakeholders in the process of planning the conversion of the Allegheny Circle into a neighborhood-scale street that fits more in line with the residential and park infrastructure in the surrounding area.<br>“This has been a dream of Northsiders for decades,” said Diana Bucco, President of the Buhl Foundation. “The partnership between the City, One Northside, the Northside Leadership Conference and a host of community folks to bring this dream to reality is just another indication that the Northside is on the rise.” <br>Construction on the project will take place in two phases. Phase One is scheduled to begin this week with the installation of two-way bicycle cycle track on the interior lane of Allegheny Circle. All public parking will be shifted to the exterior curb lane of the circle. This work will include: painting, installation of flexible delineators, parking signage, and signal timing improvements. Work is scheduled to be completed by September 22, 2017. <br>During installation, commuters should anticipate intermittent lane restrictions and temporary "No Parking" zones throughout the project area starting the week of Tuesday, September 12. The project area includes: Allegheny Circle (North Commons, East Commons, South Commons, West Commons); East Ohio Street from East Commons to Cedar Avenue; Federal Street from North Commons to North Avenue; West Ohio Street/Ridge Road from Merchant Street to West Commons. No permanent closures or detours are required during this Phase.    <br>In 2018, as part of a SMART transportation grant, the project will be completed with the conversion of the Circle to two-way traffic, demolition of traffic islands, replacement of three traffic signals with stop signs and related pedestrian accommodations, including upgrades to the pedestrian crossings at intersections. The goal of the reconstruction project is to transform the highway-like roadway to a more appropriate neighborhood street that reconnects the community and its schools, churches, entertainment facilities, and recreational assets including the city’s bicycle network.  <br>“These improvements will be truly transformative for the entire community on the Northside,” noted Jeremy Leventhal, Managing Partner of Faros Properties, the development firm redeveloping the Allegheny Center. “Allegheny Center has long been isolated by a four-lane highway. We’re thrilled that the community and city have worked to reconnect the streets for pedestrians and bikers with thoughtful and collaborative urban planning.”  <br>The completion of the two-way conversion project will include a series of future public meetings with private and community stakeholders through the course of the next eight months. <br>The City of Pittsburgh is working with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission, Buhl Foundation, Faros Properties and several community stakeholders on the reconstruction project. <br>The total cost of this initial phase is $80,000. All work is weather permitting.  <br>### | 12/9/2017 12:28:09 |

Zappala Jr. | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 15, 2017) The Office of the Mayor and the Public Safety Department have been actively engaged with District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala's office since Mr. Zappala raised concerns about cooperation with Pittsburgh Police in July. <br>Mr. Zappala wrote a letter regarding his concerns about use-of-force investigations to Mayor Peduto's Chief of Staff Kevin Acklin on July 24.

Cities are capturing the imagination of entrepreneurs, planners, and technology and creative industries. “Smart” hubs – punctuated by driverless vehicles and transit, instant connectivity and network efficiency – are driving innovation at the local level. Yet problems persist. For example, threats to health and security from climate change hurt some people more than others due to systemic structures in local planning and land use._<br>_What can leaders at the forefront of city ingenuity teach us about resiliency and prosperity? About overcoming the legacy of racial discrimination and marginalization that leaves underinvested communities more vulnerable? About clean transportation and infrastructure and energy efficiency? About affordable housing and access to opportunity? Visionary leadership is critical to these investments. Hear from an acclaimed national community development leader and three mayors about the dynamics facing cities and how their cities respond with vision._<br>Besides Mayor Peduto the panel will include: Dan Bartholomay, Chief Executive Officer, Rail~Volution, Minneapolis; Moderator: Maurice Jones, President, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), New York; Michael Hancock, Mayor, City and County of Denver; and Libby Schaaf, Mayor, City of Oakland. <br>Tomorrow the Mayor will be in New York City as part of events for [the United Nations Climate Week NYC](http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/join-the-unfccc-at-climate-week-nyc-2017/), and the launch of the Climate Action Leadership Network, which is convening to drive climate action initiatives in advance of 2020, when national governments will meet as part of the international Paris Climate Change Agreement. <br>All of the Denver and New York City travel expenses are being covered by event organizers.

| City of Pittsburgh Holds Grand Reopening of Beechview Senior Community Center | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 25, 2017) After years of work the City of Pittsburgh today celebrated the reopening of the Beechview Senior Community Center. <br>The center, at 1550 Broadway Avenue, was under reconstruction for more than two years and has been completely rehabilitated. <br>"It took some patience but seniors in Beechview now have one of the nicest community centers in the city, which they richly deserve," Mayor William Peduto said. <br>Rebuilding the center was a top priority of Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak. <br>"I'm incredibly proud of all who worked so hard to see this project through to completion. It was a labor of love, and much labor was needed to keep the process on track despite several hurdles. Seniors, teens, and all Beechview neighbors now have a beautiful, historic, safe, and practical community space," she said. <br>Demolition, abatement, elevator work, new windows and masonry restoration were performed at the site from the start of construction in April 2015 and completed in July 2016. Phase two, which included further renovations to the site and 3 ½ floors of the building, began in September 2016 and were fully completed in August.  <br>The construction cost was $3.3 million. <br>"This beautiful new facility will model how Citiparks' Healthy Active Living program will operate in the future as a vibrant multi-generational and multi-cultural destination for the communities it serves," Citiparks Director Jim Griffin said. | 25/9/2017 10:37:01 |
| Mayor William Peduto Advances Plans for Downtown Police Zone & New Fire/EMS Alerting System | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 25, 2017) Legislation is being introduced to Pittsburgh City Council tomorrow authorizing a lease for a new Downtown police substation near Market Square, and a new fire and medic station alerting system. <br>Mayor William Peduto, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and other law enforcement personnel have been in talks for months with Downtown business, cultural and residential groups regarding plans to establish a new Downtown substation for police. Legislation will be introduced to council tomorrow to lease the Lantern Building at 600 Liberty Avenue for that purpose.  <br>The five-year lease with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the building's owners, will be for $1 per year plus an upfront security deposit of $5,000, along with an agreement that the City will cover utility expenses. <br>According to Director Hissrich the inside of the building is in move-in condition but it will need some additional security upgrades before Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers can fully occupy the substation. It should be in full working order by Light Up Night, Friday, November 18. <br>The Mayor and the Public Safety Department are also introducing legislation for a contract with Purvis Systems for the installation of new $2.3 million Fire and Emergency Medical Services station alerting system. <br>The alerting system will supplement the current radio dispatch system by sharing 9-1-1 call information digitally in addition to via radio. Firefighters and medics will be able to respond more quickly to calls for assistance and improve the accuracy of the information shared between the caller, the call taker, the dispatcher and the members of the two bureaus. <br>The upgrades should also reduce day-to-day stress for firefighters and medics. The current radio system broadcasts every call citywide to every fire and medic station; the new system will alert only those stations needed to respond to a specific call, and thereby allow them to be quieter. <br>The existing radio alert system will stay in place as the new digital system is phased in over a roughly 12 month period. Even once the new system is operational, the current radio system will remain functional for communications once units leave the stations, and as backup in case of station alerting system failure. | 25/9/2017 11:23:03 |

| Regional Partnership Receives Interest in Amazon Headquarters from 20 Properties Around Pittsburgh Region | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 28, 2017) County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and Mayor William Peduto are pleased to announce that twenty property owners and developers have filed Expressions of Interest in participating in Amazon HQ2 Team Pittsburgh's response to Amazon's [request for proposals](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Anything/test/images/usa/RFP_3._V516043504_.pdf) for a second headquarters location.<br>The formal response by Amazon HQ2 Team Pittsburgh ("HQ2PGH") must be filed by October 19. HQ2PGH – a partnership of government, business, university, non-profit and community organizations – will review all the proposed properties over the next three weeks and judge which will create the strongest bid to draw Amazon HQ2 to the greater Pittsburgh region.<br>- This process is just one more way that Pittsburgh distinguishes itself from other regions,” said Fitzgerald. “Our ability to work together and bring folks from varying interests to the table for a common goal is a unique part of our fabric, and one that will set us apart in this effort. The interest in this process and this bid has been substantial, and we are excited to see so many coming together to work collectively on this response.”<br>- This is a tremendous response and confirms just how serious Pittsburgh is about landing this headquarters. I want to thank everyone who expressed interest today – if we are going to land this transformational project it's going to take the full support of every stakeholder in the region, and this proves we have that," Mayor Peduto said.<br>HQ2PGH issued its Request for Expressions of Interest (RFEI)  [on September 21](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1001). It asked respondents to ensure their sites meet Amazon’s requirements, as outlined in the HQ2 RFP referenced above. Responses had to include approximately 500,000 square feet of space by 2019, and up to 8 million square feet beyond 2027 through greenfield sites, infill sites, existing buildings, or a combination of these options.<br>Respondents had to suggest sites and/or buildings over which they have site control and demonstrate how those sites meet or exceed Amazon’s criteria as well as the additional criteria put forth by HQ2PGH in the RFEI.<br>The respondents had until 10 a.m. today to file proposals with the HQ2PGH offices in Two PNC Plaza. Responses came from locations across Allegheny, Fayette and Washington counties.<br>The respondents are not being identified for competitive reasons.<br>"We're thrilled at the response today, which will help us put together the strongest possible HQ2 proposal for Pittsburgh. I'm sure the other regions competing against us would love to know all the properties we have in our arsenal, and we're not going to give them that advantage," said Kevin Acklin, Mayor Peduto's Chief Development Officer. <br>Inquiries from interested parties regarding the work by HQ2PGH can be directed to [AmazonPGH@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:AmazonPGH@pittsburghpa.gov).<br>_Contacts:_<br>_Amie M.

| Bloomfield Halloween Parade To Be Held As Scheduled | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 3, 2017) The annual Bloomfield Halloween Parade will be held as scheduled later this month, following an emergency fundraising effort by several Bloomfield and Pittsburgh-area partners. <br>The Bloomfield Citizens Council announced last week that the parade was being cancelled due to high costs. Mayor William Peduto and others – including Little Italy Days and Columbus Day Parade organizers – led a fundraising drive to make sure the family-friendly parade will be held as scheduled the evening of October 26. <br>"This is a nearly 50-year-old tradition beloved by generations, and there was no way we were going to let it end," Mayor Peduto said. <br>Bloomfield resident Shannon Lyons led community efforts to revive the parade after the BCC announced it was being canceled. Little Italy Days president Sal Richetti and Columbus Day Parade chairman Guy Costa have collected funds to pay the Halloween Parade's expenses, which include funding for entertainers, insurance and permit fees. (The City of Pittsburgh charges a $500 fee for weeknight parades.)  <br>"Shannon was instrumental in keeping this family-friendly tradition alive, which means so much to the Bloomfield community," Costa said. <br>Supporters of the fundraising effort included Sen. Jay Costa, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, City Councilwoman Deb Gross and City Councilman Dan Gilman. A major donation was made by Highmark, Allegheny Health Network and West Penn Hospital. <br>The 32nd annual Pittsburgh Columbus Day Parade will be held in Bloomfield this Saturday, October 7, at 11 a.m. The Liberty Avenue parade begins at Baum Boulevard and ends at the Bloomfield Bridge. | 3/10/2017 11:59:00 |

| City To Close Structurally Deficient Public Works Facility in Knoxville; Services to Residents Unaffected | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 9, 2017) As a result of structural engineering report finding the Division 4 Public Works facility is unsafe for both workers and machinery, the facility on Bausman Street in Knoxville will closed at the end of the month and then demolished in mid-November. <br>Snowplowing, salting, street cleaning, pothole patching and other services to city residents within the division will not be impacted. All employees are being retained and will deliver services from the bordering 3rd and 5th divisions instead. <br>Previous condition assessments by the Massaro Corp. of the storage shed and salt dome at the site at 414 Bausman Street had called the facilities an "eyesore" and rated the buildings to be in critical to fair condition. A more recent report filed in August by structural engineers Walter P. Moore Associates found "potential life safety hazards" at the facilities, causing the Department of Public Works in conjunction with the Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections to call for the closure of the buildings.  <br>In advance of the winter season all employees will be moved to the 3rd and 5th Divisions by the end of October. Demolition is expected in mid-November. <br>The Walter P. Moore report found: <br>_The overhead roof structure presents a structural concern that it may not be able to support the code-required snow loads in its present condition, WPM has concerns for a occupant safety beneath the roof structural systems at the building. Pedestrian safety is also a concern due to the deteriorated state of the face component and potential for overhead hazards. Overall, the building is in poor condition and in need of extensive repairs to correct potential life safety hazards that currently exist._<br>_The second level garage framing and load bearing walls are showing signs of distress, the corrosion is a sign that there may be more underlying conditions. The steel beams are currently supporting the street cleaners and small pickup trucks, deflection was not observed, only corrosion and deterioration. This means that the floors can support the current equipment; however, larger equipment may cause deflection. That said, we don't advise applying any additional loading which could be in the form of but not limited to: more vehicles, larger vehicles, or using the garage for additional storage._<br>The report estimates repairs would cost $1.27 million. [A copy of the summary report is here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/647_4th-Division-Assessment.pdf). <br>Eleven workers will transferred to the 3rd Division and ten to the 5th Division. Two foremen, a clerk and a supervisor will also be transferred. <br>PLI is contracting for an asbestos study of the facilities, after which it will seek bids for demolition, which will likely occur in mid-November. | 9/10/2017 10:34:18 |
| City Outlines Public Input Opportunities for Climate Action Plan | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 9, 2017) Today, the City of Pittsburgh outlined additional public input opportunities for the City’s Climate Action Plan.   <br>In order to continue to enhance public engagement and provide for robust community input, the City presented the Climate Action Plan to the City Planning Commission on September 26th. The purpose of presenting to Planning Commission is to integrate the Climate Plan into future considerations made by the Commission. The City is seeking the Planning Commission to accept the plan and provide a recommendation for approval to Pittsburgh City Council.   <br>The next Planning Commission meeting is scheduled for October 10th, 2017. Following the planning commission’s recommendation to City Council there will be additional opportunities for public input by enabling City Council’s legislative process.   <br>Citizens can continue to provide on-line comments to [climate@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:climate@pittsburghpa.gov) throughout this process.  <br>Like all resolutions before City Council, Council will introduce the resolution, have the ability to host a public hearing and/or post agenda educational session, convene a preliminary vote and host a final vote.  <br>At each point in the legislative process, citizens will have the ability to provide input. The City Council legislative process take several weeks once it is initiated.  <br>The City welcomes more comments and suggestions on the plan during that period and beyond the legislative process. The Plan is not intended to be a static document, but and adaptive strategy that help guide city-wide efforts to address climate change.  <br>**FAQ - About the Climate Planning Process:**<br>Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan 3.0 builds on prior climate action versions organized by non-governmental organizations by increasing the technical rigor, incorporating professional evaluations of recommendations, enhanced community engagement and incorporating the City’s planning approval process through engagement of the Planning Commission and City Council.   <br>The development of the Pittsburgh Climate Plan by the City of Pittsburgh has been a 3-year, thoughtful, civic engagement process. The purpose of the plan is to identify the primary sources of local greenhouse emissions and work with the key contributors of those emissions and technical experts to develop strategies for emission reduction.   <br>The deliberative civic engagement effort included contributions from hundreds of residents who volunteered their time, and over 90 organizations from Pittsburgh’s business community, non-profit sector and local, state and federal government based in Pittsburgh. Over the course of the last three years the City representatives have hosted or participated in over 100 community meetings, workshops and events to help gather input and content for the plan.  <br>The plan [is available for review here.](http://pittsburghpa.gov/onepgh/)<br>**Why Develop a Climate Action Plan?**<br>The City of Pittsburgh is taking action on a global crisis to help set the course for a cleaner, more prosperous and healthy future for the residents and businesses of the City.  Local governments work to help provide for the health, safety and welfare of all of their residents.  The Plan identifies key strategies to improve both the local environment, but also build equitable and innovative local economic opportunities across the city.  <br>**What is in the plan?**<br>The plan provides a series of thoughtful and logical strategies and recommendations to reduce GHG emissions that originate inside the City of Pittsburgh.  Suggested strategies range from encouraging energy efficiency in commercial buildings to encouraging ways to allow for more walking, biking and transit trips in the transportation sector, plus many more.  <br>**Who developed the content in the Plan?**<br>The Pittsburgh Climate Plan has consisted of an open sourced framework through the partnership of the Pittsburgh Climate Initiative (PCI), a collaboration of community, university, and local government partners.  The City of Pittsburgh has helped to coordinate members over the last 3 years.  <br>The chapter framework in the Climate Plan were developed by a combination of citizen representatives and City of Pittsburgh employees. Content was developed through a series of workshops and deliberative civic forums facilitated community volunteers, university staff, the CMU Center for Democracy, National Academies of Science and City of Pittsburgh.  <br>Content was identified by residents and stakeholders representing sectors ranging from community development, universities, healthcare, commercial buildings, utilities, energy, housing, transportation, industry, research, agriculture and public advocacy.  <br>**Where does all the data and information in the plan originate?**<br>The plan benefits from numerous research reports, energy systems data analysis, and concurrent community planning strategies undertaken by the City of Pittsburgh, local utilities, local universities – (Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University and Chatham University), U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Lab (NETL), International Council for Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), American Geophysical Union (AGU) and local community partners during the 3-year development effort.   <br>Will there be opportunities for future community inputs in Pittsburgh’s climate activities?  <br>Yes.

| City Working to Preserve Affordable Housing for Residents Impacted by Absentee Landlord | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 11, 2017) Mayor William Peduto's administration and others are working to preserve affordable housing for residents of more than 100 homes in Homewood, Larimer and Garfield who are being forced to relocate due to deplorable housing conditions left unaddressed by an out-of-state landlord.  <br>The Administration is working with Representative Ed Gainey, Councilman Rev. Ricky Burgess, the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh and others to provide relocation support to effected residents, and on a separate path seek to acquire the properties, improve them, and return them to the affordable housing market.  <br>"This is a prime example of out-of-state property owners operating decrepit properties, and mistreating city residents, while taking federal subsidies," said Mayor William Peduto's Chief of Staff and Chief Development Officer Kevin Acklin.   <br>Bethesda Homewood Properties received federal assistance payments from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide subsidized housing in roughly 140 apartments scattered through the East End neighborhoods noted above, of which an estimated 106 are currently occupied.  <br>Inspectors for HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center found major deficiencies in the Bethesda Homewood apartments and ordered the company to fix them. It did not. On Thursday, September 14, HUD issued an enforcement action against Bethesda Homewood. This was the final action by HUD after attempting to require the owners to return the homes to safe and decent condition.  <br>"HUD has initiated an enforcement action against the owner of Bethesda Homewood for the failure to comply with HUD’s requirement for maintaining the Project in acceptable physical condition," the order stated.  <br>Most of the 140 units are in Homewood, with 10 in Garfield and 6 in Larimer.  <br>As the units are in unacceptable condition, relocation assistance will be provided to residents by HUD and the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) to help them find suitable replacement housing. <br>HUD is holding meetings with residents to provide an overview of relocation services and timelines, and the Housing Authority will assist residents with obtaining Tenant Protection Vouchers to help pay for new housing.  <br>The first meeting with residents was held this morning and another will be held at 6:00 p.m. tonight at the Homewood-Brushton YMCA.  <br>The agenda for the meetings is as follows:  <br>- Welcome, Introduction and Purpose of Meeting – PDD  (HUD Property Disposition Division)  <br>  <br>- Explanation of the Relocation Process – Leumas Residential (Relocation Contractor)  <br>  <br>- Explanation of Vouchering, Unit Inspection, Leasing and HAP Contract Execution Process – HACP <br>  <br>- Question and Answer Session – Tenants and Respondents  <br>  <br>HUD and the relocation contractor will provide relocation assistance to those who qualify.  Assistance being offered includes:  <br>- $100 for travel expenses to see units.  <br>  <br>- $200 for application fees, etc.  <br>  <br>- Funding to cover security deposit (with lease presented)  <br>  <br>- Moving costs, following the standard federal relocation cost schedule based on rooms in the current unit.  <br>  <br>- Funding for cost of transferring utilities or for utility deposits if this is required for residents to establish utility service.    <br>  <br>- Preference for a Housing Choice Voucher if they qualify.  HACP will conduct standard eligibility screening.    <br>  <br>The relocation contractor will work one on one with each household, HACP, and other resources to assist in this process. The contractor is also looking to establish temporary office location for ongoing one-on-one meetings with households.   <br>In the longer term the City is working with housing advocates and community organizations to obtain the properties, return them to suitable condition, and place them back into the affordable housing market. That work is ongoing. | 11/10/2017 13:30:50 |

| PITTSBURGH SHOWCASES REGION’S STRENGTHS THROUGH AMAZON HQ2 PROPOSAL | _All Pittsburgh Fans Asked to Join Effort and Share Why #OURPGHQ2_<br>**PITTSBURGH** – October 19, 2017 – The regional partnership formed to pursue the Amazon HQ2 opportunity (PGHQ2) today submitted the region’s proposal for Pittsburgh to host Amazon’s second headquarters. The proposal was submitted jointly by City of Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and Allegheny Conference on Community Development CEO Stefani Pashman.<br>The proposal, _Future. Forged. For All_., is a clear articulation that there is no better choice than Pittsburgh for Amazon’s HQ2, now and into the future. A dedicated project team composed of a broad group of civic, business, university and foundation leaders worked diligently together for nearly six weeks to craft a clear, concise, cohesive message that directly addresses the requirements that Amazon identified in its request for proposal.<br>“It’s a proud moment for Pittsburgh,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “What Amazon is looking for in cities across North America is already here. We have been preparing for this for thirty years. Our region has tremendous assets that should be appealing to Amazon: a world-class talent pool, high quality of life at a low cost, a stable business environment, and significant capacity to grow.”<br>“Like Amazon, Pittsburgh thinks big. Like no other place, we can offer the opportunity to build the city and headquarters of the future, together making a lasting, positive impact for all,” said Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto. “Beyond a great place to do business, with unique financial and quality of life advantages, our proposal offers unmatched opportunity to address social equity investments in education, infrastructure and housing affordability.”<br>The PGHQ2 partnership will serve as the Amazon welcome committee and dedicated partner ensuring a soft landing and support for Amazon’s long-term success should the Pittsburgh region be selected. Housed at the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, PGHQ2 will coordinate the efforts of all local jurisdictions, businesses, universities, and foundations that have volunteered their support for Amazon’s Pittsburgh expansion. <br>“The region was built on collaboration and our collective efforts to attract Amazon are no different,” said Stefani Pashman, CEO, Allegheny Conference on Community Development. “Our proposal emphasizes how the community is prepared to activate our powerful public-private partnerships spanning corporate, philanthropic and government entities for the benefit of Amazon and of the Pittsburgh region. PGHQ2 embodies this spirit of cooperation and also builds off the knowledge and expertise that the Allegheny Conference has developed serving as the region’s economic development organization.”<br>Amazon issued its [request for proposals](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Anything/test/images/usa/RFP_3._V516043504_.pdf) for a second headquarters city on September 7, and final bids are due October 19. More than 400 passionate stakeholders, working alongside consultants from HR&A Advisors, Maya Design and Gatesman, contributed to Pittsburgh’s proposal. The PNC Financial Services Group donated a floor of the Two PNC building downtown to provide a centralized location for this cross-sector effort. Due to the competitive nature of the bid process, specifics from the proposal, such as key sites and economic details of Pittsburgh’s offer, remain confidential under a non-disclosure agreement signed with Amazon.<br>Representatives of the PGHQ2 team, including County Executive Fitzgerald and Mayor Peduto, are asking Pittsburgh fans to share why Pittsburgh is their headquarters, too. In a social challenge, issued from the new [HQPittsburgh.com](http://www.hqpittsburgh.com/) website, Pittsburgh enthusiasts are asked, “Whether you chose Pittsburgh, or Pittsburgh chose you, share why the Burgh is yours,” and encouraged to post photos, videos, memes or comments to their social channels to tell their story, using the hashtag: #OURPGHQ2.<br>The HQPittsburgh.com site also shares testimonials from Pittsburgh region small and large  business owners, foundations, community organizations, educational institutions and more. Those interested in submitting a testimonial, or who have questions regarding the work by PGHQ2, can reach out through [AmazonPGH@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:AmazonPGH@pittsburghpa.gov).<br>* * *<br>Below are quotes from select PGHQ2 partners reflecting the passionate support for Pittsburgh as Amazon’s second headquarters.<br>“We’re excited at the prospect of making our proposal – and this new partnership – a reality. Welcoming Amazon’s second headquarters to Pittsburgh would grow jobs, spin start-ups, advance research, leverage highly-skilled talent, and immediately enrich our city’s growing innovation district. This is what our universities are here to support. We welcome the opportunity to work with Amazon.”<br>Patrick Gallagher, Chancellor, University of Pittsburgh<br>“Pittsburgh has become a magnet for major companies who want to get ahead of the curve, and entrepreneurs who want to make a difference. The computing and data technologies that are shaping this century have their roots here, and the vitality and can-do spirit that gave the world artificial intelligence, driverless cars, and so much more make this an ideal environment for Amazon’s continued development as an innovative disruptor of consumer markets.”<br>Farnam Jahanian, Interim President, Carnegie Mellon University<br>“Like Pittsburgh itself, CCAC continues to evolve– providing the region’s business and industry partners with the creative workforce solutions they need to successfully compete in today’s fast-paced and increasingly complex global economy. For innovative companies like Amazon, Pittsburgh offers a workforce skilled in the lexicon of the modern workplace – one reliant on problem-solving, advanced technological know-how and a solid commitment to sustainable growth and development.”<br>Dr. Quintin Bullock, President, Community College of Allegheny County<br>“This process, and bid, is about our region’s future. We don’t just talk about a future forged for all, we walk the walk. We know that the collaboration and collective effort put forth will benefit all those in our community. Having Amazon choose Pittsburgh will also mean other indirect investment and, just as importantly, opportunity for all of our residents, new and old.”<br>Esther L.

| Mayor William Peduto Thanks Human Rights Campaign for 100% Equality Index Score & Announces New Gender Affirmation Benefits for City Workers and Dependents | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 19, 2017) Mayor William Peduto today thanked the Human Rights Campaign for giving Pittsburgh its first 100% score in its national ratings system for inclusion by municipal governments, and in a related matter announced new gender affirmation benefits for City workers and their dependents.<br>The HRC's _Municipal Equality Index_ is the only nationwide rating system of LGBTQ inclusion in municipal law and policy, and shows how cities across the country continue to take the lead in supporting LGBTQ people and workers.<br>"We are very, very proud of this 100% rating from the HRC, which we've been working hard to reach through all four years I've been in office," Mayor Peduto said. “We owe a lot of thanks to Councilmen Bruce Kraus and Dan Gilman for their [legislation banning conversion therapy](https://pittsburgh.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2895689&GUID=1DB6E05E-F28C-47DD-9440-DF12B19F77C3&Options=ID|Text|&Search=conversion+therapy) in the city, which was approved unanimously by City Council last year and helped our score.”<br>The Mayor also announced today that the City is now offering full gender affirmation benefits to all employees and their dependents who are enrolled in the City's medical plans.<br>For several years the City has offered mental health and hormonal therapy benefits. The City's medical plan is now offering coverage for surgical treatments for gender affirmation as well.<br>"This proves again the welcoming and open spirit Pittsburgh city government has for its workers and their families. I want to thank the city Personnel Department and our LGBTQIA+ advisory council for all their work on this important matter," Mayor Peduto said.<br>The City does not have data on how many will take advantage of the new benefit. The cost impact on its medical plan is expected to be minimal.<br>The HRC Foundation is the educational arm of the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights organization. It releases the _Municipal Equality Index_ each year, in partnership with the Equality Federation Institute, in order to assess LGBTQ equality in 506 cities across the nation, including 10 in Pennsylvania.<br>For LGBTQ Americans, legal protections and benefits vary widely depending on location – states and cities have markedly different laws governing discrimination. Twenty states have non-discrimination laws that include protections for LGBTQ people in employment, and 19 states have laws that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in places of public accommodation. But cities are leading the way: since the MEI’s debut in 2012, the number of cities earning perfect scores has increased more than sixfold, and today at least 24 million people live in cities that have more comprehensive, transgender-inclusive non-discrimination laws than their state.<br>The average score for cities in Pennsylvania is 75 out of 100 points, which falls above the national average of 57. Pittsburgh joins Allentown and Philadelphia this year in receiving a 100% score.<br>The full report, including detailed scorecards for every city, as well as a searchable database, is available online at [www.hrc.org/mei](http://www.hrc.org/mei). | 19/10/2017 15:08:59 |

Five cities will ultimately receive millions of dollars more to fully implement their proposals. <br>The submission follows Mayor William Peduto's participation in the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership initiative in July, and his work for years with the Bloomberg Philanthropies on climate change issues. <br>"The City of Pittsburgh has pledged to transition to 100% renewable energy city-wide by 2035. As a fossil fuel rich region with some of the lowest energy prices in the country, incentivizing residents to pay a higher premium for local renewable energy is a major hurdle to reaching this target," the City's proposal says. <br>"While the city boasts some of the most high performing buildings in the world, an aging and inefficient housing stock has given Pittsburgh the distinction of 6th worst city for residential energy burden. The opportunity is to slash monthly energy bills as a first step to make renewable energy purchase more viable and equitable for all Pittsburghers. . . .  <br>The solution is to create a platform (think Groupon) that aggregates purchasing demand across the city and challenges the market for high quality products, thus lowering the cost to anyone looking to retrofit or weatherize. An easy to use platform will incorporate all offers from regional nonprofits and utility providers. A mobile van program coupled with DIY workshops will make this project accessible to all, transforming the city's housing and building stock to 21st century efficiency and comfort standards."  <br>The 35 winners of the first round of submissions is expected to be announced by early next year. | 25/10/2017 11:59:55 |

| City of Pittsburgh Announces Joint Consent Agreement for Penn Plaza and Enright Park Redevelopment in East Liberty | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 27, 2017) A Consent Agreement has been reached among the City of Pittsburgh, Pennley Park South, LG Realty Advisors, and four local neighborhood groups in regards to key issues surrounding the redevelopment of Penn Plaza, including affordable housing, preservation of public open space, and terms of the development itself. This Consent Agreement resolves the outstanding lawsuits among the parties.<br>This week’s Consent Agreement is the result of more than 1000 collective hours of discussions, mediation sessions, and negotiations led by Downtown Attorney William Pietragallo II among the City, Pennley Park South, LG Realty Advisors, East Liberty Development, Inc. (ELDI), Friendship Community Group, Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation, and the Enright Park Neighborhood Association. <br>The Consent Agreement establishes the following:<br>- An East End Affordable Housing Fund to help bridge the gap for financing mixed income housing projects that will provide long-term affordable/subsidized housing as well as moderate income market rate units in East Liberty, Garfield, and Larimer. <br>- The Housing Fund will be supported by a 50% TRID (Transit Revitalization Investment District) contribution by Pennley Park South pursuant to a plan jointly developed by the City, the Neighborhood Groups, and Pennley Park South.<br>- All will be within one mile. <br>- All of the projects supported by this dedicated fund are expected to be completed concurrent with the full build-out of LG Realty's new development.<br>- Enright Park, the City Park adjacent to the development site, will be reconfigured, redesigned, and rebuilt as an improved amenity to the community. As part of the agreed-upon new site plan, the park will connect Negley and Euclid Avenues, acting as a greenway between Friendship and the heart of East Liberty, as well as a buffer between the residences around the site and the new commercial development. <br>- An agreed-upon reconfigured overall site plan for the development, focused on retail and office uses, will create a blend of workforce jobs and maximize tax revenue to the city.<br>- A robust public process will precede plan approval, including two community meetings and review by the City Planning Commission and other appropriate bodies.<br>No replacement housing is currently planned for the Pennl Plaza site but the Housing Fund created by this agreement should allow many of the roughly 200 residents displaced by the redevelopment to ultimately return to affordable apartments in the vicinity of the East Liberty site.<br>“While I’m happy this settlement was reached we must remember the many longtime East Liberty residents displaced by this development, which was first announced two and a half years ago,” Mayor William Peduto said. “I want to thank everyone – especially ELDI, Friendship Community Group, Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation, and the Enright Park Neighborhood Association – for all their hard work on this agreement and its commitments to funding affordable housing and rebuilding the neighborhood’s park,” Mayor William Peduto said.<br>Lawrence Gumberg, President of LG Realty Advisors, Inc., stated, “William Pietragallo II, Mayor Bill Peduto, and all of the neighborhood groups brought  extraordinary collaboration to come to this Consent Agreement. We thank them for their efforts and look forward to working together to build a signature project for East Liberty and the City.”<br>Jon Pushinsky and David Toal, Counsel for the Intervenors stated, "This was truly a collaborative effort. We examined every possible means of guaranteeing long-term mixed-income housing at and in the immediate environs of the former housing development. The end result of our efforts will benefit the entire community. New mixed-income housing in close proximity to the former Penn Plaza will create opportunities for low-income residents to continue to be part of an economically thriving East Liberty and East End. We will have an upgraded Enright Park with improved access for the whole community, linking formerly isolated pockets of the neighborhoods, and a vibrant commercial development. We appreciate the hard work of our mediation partners and our tireless mediator, Bill Pietragallo."<br>Special Mediator Bill Pietragallo said, “The global resolution of these important and diverse individual, neighborhood, business, commercial and governmental issues is one of the most gratifying experiences of my professional career. I am proud to have been of service to the people of Pittsburgh.”<br>_For more information, please contact City Solicitor Lourdes Sanchez-Ridge at 412-255-2015._ | 27/10/2017 14:28:14 |

| Mayor William Peduto Joins Alliance to Slash U.S. Transportation Energy Use by Half in 2050 | The Alliance to Save Energy chartered a national commission of business, government and civil society leaders that will work together to develop a pathway and recommendations to reduce energy use in the U.S. transportation sector by 50 percent by 2050 while meeting future mobility needs.<br>The commission, chaired by Audi of America President Scott Keogh and National Grid U.S. President Dean Seavers, includes Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto and Fort Worth, Texas, Mayor Betsy Price, along with leaders representing vehicle manufacturers, utilities, federal agencies, environmental and consumer groups, infrastructure providers and public transit. <br>Transportation represents roughly one-third of U.S. energy consumption. The sector is undergoing a transformational change – ranging from the increased viability of alternative fuels such as electrification to advanced vehicle technologies, automation and shared mobility – offering enormous opportunities to improve energy efficiency. Improvements in efficiency will create jobs, improve energy security, boost competitiveness, save businesses and consumers money, and reduce emissions.<br>The Alliance Commission on U.S. Transportation Sector Efficiency (the “50 by 50” Commission) will work through six Technical Committees (Light-Duty Vehicles; Non-Road Vehicles; Heavy-Duty and Freight Vehicles; Enabling Infrastructure; Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Shared Mobility and Automation; and Outreach and Implementation) to develop the regulatory, policy and investment pathways to achieve the “50 by 50” energy use reduction goal. Following an outside peer-review process, the Commission will publish a final report, and engage local, state, and national officials, key stakeholder groups and the public to act on the recommendations.<br>Kateri Callahan, President, Alliance to Save Energy, said: “Transportation in the United States is changing rapidly and it presents an enormous opportunity to improve mobility and drive economic prosperity while at the same time saving energy and reducing pollution. We’re bringing together experts from across this sector because we need a comprehensive approach to maximize the energy efficiency gains. The response to our invitations has been overwhelming and we’re eager to see this group bring forward consensus-based, aggressive plans that will inspire public leaders, the business community and the public.”<br>“We’re at a fascinating time in the transportation industry,” said Scott Keogh, president, Audi of America. “The way in which vehicles are powered and how they’re driven is evolving. We’re at an inflection point and we have an opportunity, as an industry and a sector, to leverage that transformation for the benefit of society. I’m proud to join this commission and work with key stakeholders across the business community to see that we fully capitalize on the potential that comes with electric, shared and automated vehicle technologies.”<br>“As our region shifts its attention to efficiency in the transportation sector, we must be ready to support our customers and communities in that transition with services, infrastructure, and affordable solutions,” said Dean Seavers, U.S. President, National Grid. “I’m proud to be part of developing a path forward that works for the people we serve and moves the dial on the fight against climate change.”<br>"Pittsburgh has become a global leader on clean energy and smart transportation solutions, but there is still a lot of hard work to do. That's why I'm so happy to be part of this commission and its efforts to bring together government, business and policy leaders from across the country. This is a collective effort to not only bring efficiency to the transportation and energy sectors, but to create the jobs of the future as well," said Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto.<br>The initiative’s Commissioners are:<br>Scott Keogh, President, Audi of America (Co-Chair);<br>Dean Seavers, President, National Grid U.S. and Executive Director, National Grid (Co-Chair);<br>Melissa Adams, Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer, WGL Holdings/Washington Gas;<br>Valerie Brader, Executive Director, Michigan Agency for Energy;<br>Stephen Brobeck, Executive Director, Consumer Federation of America;<br>John Di Stasio, President, Large Public Power Council;<br>Bruce Edelston, Vice President, Energy Policy, Southern Company;<br>Matt Enstice, President & CEO, Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus;<br>Dr. Martin Keller, Laboratory Director, National Renewable Energy Laboratory;<br>Tom Kuhn, President, Edison Electric Institute;<br>Eric McCarthy, Senior Vice President, Government Relations, Public Policy and Legal Affairs, Proterra;<br>Mark McNabb, CEO, Electrify America; <br>Arlen Orchard, General Manager & CEO, Sacramento Municipal Utility District;<br>Thomas S.

Deep and fundamental changes are necessary to restructure the authority and preserve the city's water system for generations to come. <br>While the audit expresses concern with city government's influence on PWSA, it is my duty to protect this valuable city asset and the safe water owed to the people I represent as Mayor. The city owns this water system after all, and when there are problems with it people come to me to look for answers. <br>We will certainly consider some of the other changes General DePasquale has recommended on the city funding and free water the city receives from PWSA, especially if such funds are put back into the authority's infrastructure needs." | 1/11/2017 11:53:52 |

| City Officials and Pittsburgh Penguins Reach Tentative Agreement on Development of Former Civic Arena Site | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 6, 2017) - The Pittsburgh Penguins and the Office of Mayor William Peduto today reached a tentative agreement that will kick-start $750 million of private investment through a private/public partnership to assure development of the former Civic Arena site.<br>The two parties agreed to amend the Option Agreement to eliminate obstacles in developing the 28-acre site on the Lower Hill. The amendment will be presented to the URA and SEA board meetings this Thursday. <br>“This agreement will pave the way for $750 million in private investment that will be truly transformative for Pittsburgh, creating a dynamic development that the region can be proud of – in addition to jobs, small business opportunities, affordable housing and community programs,” said David Morehouse, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Penguins.<br>The development will include over 1,000 residential units (20 percent of which will be affordable housing), 500,000 square feet of office space, and 250,000 square feet of entertainment and retail. It will also include the highest levels of MWBE employment opportunities in a Pittsburgh development project. Among other benefits to the community, a LERTA program will generate more than $25 million to be re-invested in the upper, middle, and lower Hill District.<br>Infrastructure work on roads and utilities continues at the former arena site and is almost completed. The Penguins have retained major national developers McCormack Baron Salazar (retail) and Clayco (office), and have an agreement with a minority developer (for residential) that will be announced soon. The Penguins also are working on destination entertainment development and have worked with internationally-renowned BIG on an open-space plan. Beyond that, a new district energy plant that will service the development is currently being constructed behind PPG Paints Arena.<br>Under the terms of the deal, the Penguins agreed to forgo receiving the $15 million which was a credit under the original Option Agreement to be deducted as payment for land value – with any net amount payable by the public to the Penguins at the end of the option agreement. The credit was viewed by the parties as a significant obstacle to development, which led to unnecessary delays and difficult negotiations.<br>In exchange, the Option Agreement will be amended to eliminate the land valuation procedures and revise the internal development deadlines to match current development deals in place.  The Penguins will be obligated to develop 6.25 acres by 2020, or they will forfeit a portion of parking revenue to be deposited in the Greater Hill District Reinvestment Fund (instead of the current risk of forfeiture of development rights under the current agreement). The forfeiture of parking revenue was pushed by the city to move the development forward more quickly, and would align the Penguins more closely with the public to cooperate together to pursue development.<br>“This has been a complex negotiation, and we reached an agreement that makes the Option Agreement better for the public,” said Mayor William Peduto.  “The Penguins agreed to eliminate the public’s obligation to pay $15 million, and we agreed to reasonable adjustments to allow more flexibility to deliver development on site that builds more affordable housing and creates substantial value for the middle and upper Hill District, and for the entire city.” <br>The current option term will be extended by one year to October 22, 2025 and the Penguins retain the ability to pay for an additional two years of extensions. However, there will be no further extensions to the 2028 option termination date or 2023 parking revenue termination date beyond the terms of the current Option Agreement, so all proposed amendments are within the overall time and economic constraints of the original agreement.<br>The amendment also returns a development parcel to the URA and SEA to build a parking garage of up to 1,000 spaces on the 28-acre site (subject to a parking demand study), which will support the planned development and PPG Paints Arena. The public will retain title to the land, revenue from the net operations of the garage, and air rights to construct additional development on the first floor and on top of the garage. In addition, up to 10% of parking taxes generated by the garage will be contributed to the Greater Hill District Reinvestment Fund.<br>In addition, there are specific public commitments dedicated to solving environmental conditions on the site, financing additional infrastructure and collaborating with the Penguins on building affordable housing. The parties agreed to jointly prioritize low income housing tax credits for the development, and upon award of such credits, make 20% of the residential units affordable at 60% of area median income, which is a higher commitment than contained in the Community Collaboration and Implementation Plan adopted in 2014.<br>### | 6/11/2017 15:57:26 |

| Mayor William Peduto Formally Submits 2018 Operating and Capital Budgets to Pittsburgh City Council | _Mayor asking State to Remove City from Act 47 Financial Distress Status_<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (November 13, 2017) Mayor William Peduto today submitted his proposed 2018 Operating and Capital budgets to Pittsburgh City Council, and announced he is [asking the state to remove the city from Act 47 Financially Distressed status](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/957_11%2013%2017%20Act%2047%20to%20Davin%20and%20Governor.docx), which the City has been under since 2004.<br>Parallel to the submission of the budgets, the Mayor will be [introducing legislation to Council](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/955_11%2013%2017%20Act%2047%20to%20Council%20Letter.docx) to cement fiscal reforms learned through the Act 47 process to protect the City from entering distressed status again.<br>“As a councilman, I was the first member of Pittsburgh city government to call for entering Act 47, and I now call for us to finally exit the process,” Mayor Peduto said. “I do this somewhat reluctantly, as Act 47 oversight has been critical to us regaining our fiscal footing, but the time is right to do so. We need to continue the fiscal discipline we have learned the past 14 years and apply it to the City’s future.”<br>The legislation will include caps on pension enhancements; standards on debt service; retiring unspent capital projects; maintaining a healthy fund balance; and how budgets will be released post Act 47.<br>The Mayor is also submitting [letters to Governor Tom Wolf and General Assembly leaders](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/956_11%2013%2017%20Pension%20Reform%20Letter%20to%20Gov%20and%20Caucus.docx) calling for a renewed effort to implement statewide municipal pension reform.<br>He has [also issued a letter today](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/958_11%2012%2017%20Big%204%20Letter.docx) to UPMC, Highmark, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh to work with the City to collectively early next year to fund affordable housing, pre-K education and safe water initiatives.<br>City Council discussion on the budget is set to begin November 20, with departmental hearings beginning the following day. The first line-item vote on the budget is currently set for December 11 and a final vote is scheduled for December 19. By law, the budget must be approved by the end of the calendar year.<br>A copy of the proposed $554 million operating budget [is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/954_2018%20Operating%20Budget-FINAL.pdf).<br>Mayor Peduto’s prepared remarks on his budget submission to Council – as set for delivery – are below.<br>“I am pleased to be here with you today to present the proposed operating and capital budgets for 2018. Today we will highlight improvements in the City’s financial condition since we began Act 47 oversight and discuss some on-going challenges and risks that must be addressed to ensure the City remains on the path towards long-term financial sustainability.<br>I also want to share some of the strategic investments we have made over the last three years, as well as some key initiatives planned for 2018 and beyond. We have made a lot of progress in restructuring city government and improving the delivery of core municipal services, but there is always room for improvement.  I am happy to share some of my priorities going forward.<br>When I assumed office in 2014, many thought that the City was ready to exit Act 47. While the City made a lot of progress in getting its financial house in order, two sets of decisions made in 2013 altered the City’s financial forecast. The first was the reduction in the millage rate after the County reassessment, and the other was the actions taken by the pension board to adjust mortality rates and lower the assumed investment rate of return.<br>Absent any further reforms, these two changes would have resulted in unbalanced budgets every year, and the City’s fund balance would have been depleted by the end of 2018. That was an unacceptable outcome for a municipality that had been operating under Act 47 for a decade, so I asked then Governor Corbett to keep the City under Act 47 oversight until we could implement more financial reforms and continue the progress on overall economic recovery.<br>In addition, we knew that we needed to contribute more to the pension fund, and that we needed to invest significantly more in our roads, bridges, and buildings.<br>With the framework of the 2014 Recovery Plan to guide us, the City has produced balanced budgets every year, achieved positive operating results, continued to put more money into the pension fund, maintained a healthy fund balance, and implemented a number of initiatives to improve city government operations.<br>Due to the progress we have made, I will be formally asking the state Department of Community and Economic Development requesting their approval to exit Act 47 oversight.<br>Just a few years ago, Pittsburgh faced an uncertain financial future. Thanks to the hard work of city employees, ongoing collaboration with City Council, and a more productive working relationship with the Act 47 Coordinators and new ICA leadership, the 2018 Budget and five-year plan continues our path towards long-term financial sustainability.<br>The 2018 Budget and Five-Year Plan strike a balance between the need to provide high-quality and efficient municipal services and invest in the City’s infrastructure while also being a prudent steward of the City’s finances. Continuing the objectives of the Act 47 Plan, the 2018 Budget and Five-Year Plan includes balanced budgets every year and maintains an adequate fund balance.<br>While our fund balance stays above the 10% target every year, we are still significantly below the GFOA recommended practice of 16.7%, so we must resist the temptation to reduce our reserves so we have an adequate amount of cash available to start the fiscal year and guard against emergencies and/or an economic downturn.<br>In addition to addressing debt, pension, and retiree health benefits, the City continues to pursue cost mitigation strategies for health care and worker’s compensation.<br>We have slowed the rate of growth in healthcare costs by moving to self-insured arrangement and by increasing our employee wellness program, which also have mitigated cost increases for our employees. <br>Through our commitment to workplace and employee safety we have reduced the number of injuries, both those requiring medical attention and those that result in lost time.<br>Though we have talked about legacy costs individually, it is important to see the overall financial impact of our efforts.<br>Debt service payments have decreased and workers’ compensation costs remain stable. Without these improvements we would not have been able to increase contributions to the City’s pension fund.<br>Since entering into Act 47, the City has decreased the size of its workforce by 26% while maintaining and even improving service levels. We have made a lot of tough decisions about programs and services while under Act 47 oversight and employees have been asked to make sacrifices in terms of compensation and benefits.<br>I am proud of the work that City employees do each and every day to make the City a great place to live, work, visit, and enjoy. Please join me in thanking them for all of their hard work throughout the year.<br>Though we have made a lot of progress to strengthen the City’s finances and prepare to exit Act 47 oversight, we cannot return to the practices of the past that led us to entering Act 47 in the first place. That’s why my administration will be submitting legislation to City Council to provide a framework for prudent financial management and ensure that we will continue to meet the financial management benchmarks we have achieved while under Act 47.<br>In a letter I am submitting to City Council I am asking them to approve these reforms by the end of the year so we can continue to adhere to solid financial management practices regardless of who serves on City Council or in the Mayor’s Office.<br>This budget reinforces our commitment to invest in core city services to provide safe, healthy, and thriving neighborhoods to ensure that Pittsburgh remains a great place to live, work, and raise a family.<br>The City has significantly fewer positions than it did in 2000, yet we need to deliver the same core services throughout City neighborhoods. Thanks to the efforts of our workforce, we are able to deliver more efficient and effective services with even fewer employees than before I took office.<br>Let’s talk about some of our key successes and initiatives we have planned for next year.<br>Since 2014 and through next year, we will have hired almost 500 police officers, which has more than tripled the amount of recruits from the previous six years. I am proud to say that we are on track to sustain a staffing level of over 900 police officers available for operations in 2018.  While reaching that goal in 2017 was important, we need to maintain a consistent level of staffing going forward given workforce demographics and historical attrition, so we will add three additional recruit classes in 2018.  <br>In addition to our plan to develop a strategic and long-term approach to fully staffing the Police Bureau, we have consistently added firefighter recruit classes to reach authorized staffing levels and reduce the need for callbacks.<br>For the period of 2014 through next year, we will have added almost 220 firefighter recruits, which is almost triple the number added for the previous 6 years. As a result of proactive succession planning, with multiple recruiting levels over the last several years, we have reduced the volume of callbacks and overall overtime.<br>In an effort to sustain a staffing level consistent with our operational needs, the City will add one additional Fire Bureau recruit class in 2018.   <br>In 2017 we hired our first EMTs to reduce the workload of paramedics responding to basic life support calls. In just a few months we have seen the benefits of the program through the thousands of calls they have responded to, which allow Paramedics to focus on calls requiring an advanced life support response. EMS leadership has also reported a reduction in the number of mutual aid calls required from other suburban departments<br>In 2018 we will continue our multi-year plan to increase the number of PLI employees, especially inspectors. These additions help the City keep pace with increased development, and provide better service to residents and business owners.<br>PLI continues to invest in cross-training to allow staff to complete more inspections across different functional areas.<br>With these additions, I am proud to share that we are seeing a return on our investment. We’ve increased plan review staff from 5 in 2014 to 12 in 2018 which has produced real results. By investing in our workforce, we’ve been able to cut building plan review times significantly. This helps facilitate development in our City, as projects move through the approval process more efficiently.<br>Investing in PLI has also allowed us to issue more building permits in each of the last four years. During this time, we’ve increased the number of permits issued by over 15% and brought in almost 20% more revenue. This allows us to continue investing in the department and to provide better services to the public.<br>From 2018 through 2023, our long-term plan will invest an additional $44M for vehicles and equipment to deliver core services. These purchases include police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks, public works trucks, and other equipment necessary to invest in our fleet to provide our employees with the vehicles and equipment they need to do their jobs.<br>The 2014 Act 47 Recovery Plan highlighted the fact that the City needed to invest more money in its infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. While investing more money in our infrastructure is a good thing, I also knew that we need to establish the proper organization, talent, policies, processes, and technology to ensure those investments were done efficiently and effectively. Several years later, I’m happy to share the progress we’ve made since 2014 and our plans for the next few years.<br>A few years ago I tasked the Office of Management and Budget with the responsibility for strategic planning and oversight for the development of a long-term investment and maintenance plan for all of the City’s assets. We have also created the Department of Mobility & Infrastructure, established the DPW Bureau of Facilities, and added staff to support both by taking a strategic look at our workforce and prioritizing our needs.<br>Not only have we added staff, but we are focusing on providing them with the knowledge and tools they need to succeed through the implementation of the Cartegraph asset management system and the current initiative to transform the facilities management function through the introduction of project management and work order processes based on leading practices.<br>With City Council’s support, we’ve made strategic investments in the facility optimization plan to guide our planning and decision-making for years to come, and are in the process of developing long-term maintenance and investment plans for all of our asset types.<br>Finally, we also continue to improve our capital budgeting process to ensure that our resources are allocated to high priority projects.<br>The 2018 Capital Budget allocates over $107M in funding for capital projects across the City.<br>The 2018 Capital Budget continues our efforts to reform the capital budgeting process and improve our assets and infrastructure. The majority of the capital projects funded 2018 will be targeted to strategic maintenance and investment in our assets and infrastructure, including roads, facilities, vehicles, and equipment.<br>Through prudent financial stewardship and responsible borrowing we have developed a realistic, long-term capital investment plan. We have seen what happens when we disinvest in our assets and infrastructure. Bridges become unsafe and must be closed or demolished; poor condition roads and sidewalk create mobility challenges; facilities have deplorable working conditions for our employees; and we end up spending more in the long-run to fix things when they break rather than focus on preventative maintenance. We need to invest more, not less in our capital program.<br>With these efforts we are positioned to responsibly increase our borrowing capacity over the next 6 years to increase investment in capital projects throughout the City and tackle the significant backlog of projects.<br>Across all funding sources, the six year capital improvement plan presented today includes nearly $647M in strategic investments for the period of 2018 through 2023. The 2018 Capital Budget will fund nearly 200 separate deliverables related to capital projects throughout the City.<br>There are meat and potatoes projects across all corners of the City – from the Middle Hill (D6) and South Side Flats (D3) to Elliot (D2) and Marshall-Shadeland (D6) – such as laying down new safety surfaces in playgrounds and painting or upgrading play equipment, which will ensure safe parks and play areas for our youngest Pittsburghers and their families.<br>The Wightman Park renovation project in Squirrel Hill (D8) will include improvements to the sports field and new play equipment as well as investments in green stormwater mitigation.<br>We will be increasing accessibility with ADA improvements to City facilities such as the Homewood Senior Center (D9), Brookline Park (D4), as well as the installation of hearing loops at Healthy Active Living Centers in the North Side (D1), Glen Hazel (D5), and Mt. Washington (D2).<br>The budget reflects thoughtful collaboration with community and authority partners on projects that will transform entire neighborhoods.  As part of PennDOT’s upgrades on East Carson Street in the South Side (D3), the City is contributing $1.5M to expand pedestrian safety enhancements.  The City is also collaborating with the URA on a project to reconstruct a large portion of Smallman Street in the Strip District (D7), and with PWSA on large-scale improvements to Four Mile Run in Schenley Park (D5).<br>The City is also participating in a cutting-edge project to help alleviate congestion in City streets. With $11M in funds from Federal Highway and a multi-million dollar commitment from the state, the city will deploy adaptive signal technology to some of our busiest corridors.  These “smart spines” include technology that allows traffic signals to sense increases in car and pedestrian traffic so green lights can be adjusted on the fly to reduce wait times.  The signals within a corridor or “spine” will also communicate with one another, so a sudden rush at one intersection can be properly managed by the other intersections as well. <br>The 2018-2023 Capital Improvement Plan includes $103 million for street resurfacing, with $16.4 million allocated in 2018. I am proud to say that the budget for street resurfacing has more than doubled since I came into office in 2014, but we continue to have a backlog since we should have been allocating $20 million every year to keep our streets in proper condition.<br>Although not part of the City’s annual paving program, projects such as the reconstruction of Smallman Street and implementation of the Federal Highway Administration’s Advanced Transportation and Congestion Management Technologies Deployment grant involve significant paving components.<br>We have accomplished a lot by increasing our investment, improving coordination with utilities, and using technology and data to better plan and manage the paving program to improve the condition of our streets. From 2018 to 2023, our new long-term plan will invest over $214M in improving facilities throughout the City.<br>Implementation of recommendations from the Facilities Optimization Plan will allow the City to better maintain its infrastructure and provide service delivery to residents. Over $900,000 will be dedicated to sport facility improvements in 2018 such as ballfield renovations, the installation of light activation buttons to aid in electrical usage, and the purchase of ADA-accessible bleachers for our outdoor hockey rinks.<br>We will continue to financially support upgrades to our recreation and senior centers, including design work to improve ADA accessibility at the Homewood Senior Center, and installing a new roof and elevator at the Warrington Rec Center in 2018.<br>Another major project on the horizon is a new public safety training facility. The design process for this facility will begin in 2018.<br>Though we have made great strides to improve the condition of City’s facilities, it’s important that we acknowledge that we continue to have a huge backlog of investment needs. According to the Facilities Optimization Plan, we need to spend $60 million immediately to get all of our facilities in “good” condition. Unfortunately, it will take us at least 5 years to address all of the current needs. I would like to work with City Council to find a way to accelerate this program and make these much needed investments<br>The structure and operations of city government today are much different than it was just a few years ago, and I believe the changes we have made are having a positive impact on how city government operates for the benefit of our residents, neighborhoods, businesses, and employees.<br>Before 2014, the Public Safety Department consisted of a Director and staff person. Today, we have a Department with strong, effective leadership that has integrated core functions such as community outreach, planning, emergency management, special events, and finance.<br>We established the Department of Innovation & Performance to deliver strategic technology services, drive innovation, and facilitate efficient and effective City services through data-driven analytics and continuous improvement.<br>In 2014 we announced a plan to begin to overhaul the Bureau of Building Inspection with the creation of the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections. Over the last few years we have restructured the department, implemented new processes, and provided employees with the tools they need to do their jobs and provide exceptional customer service. We’ve made great strides, but there’s more work to do.<br>The Bureau of Neighborhood Empowerment was created to focus on strategies and initiatives in areas such as housing, education, small business development, and diversity and inclusion to improve communities and address the needs of targeted populations.<br>Building on these organizational changes, in 2018 we will be focused on the transformation and modernization of city government to position the City to meet the current and future needs of our residents, businesses, neighborhoods, employees, and other stakeholders. Some of the key initiatives that are reflected in the proposed 2018 Budget include the following:<br>- Expanding the role of the newly created Department of Mobility & Infrastructure to improve the organization, planning, coordination, and execution of mobility and transportation projects, processes, and initiatives;<br>- Transitioning the Personnel Department into a modern human resources department focused on recruiting, developing, managing, and retaining a highly qualified and diverse workforce;<br>- Aligning the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program under the Office of Management and Budget to centralize all grant management and compliance functions;<br>- Increasing the number of PLI staff and commencing implementation of the new permitting and licensing system to modernize this important function; and<br>- Establishing a Bureau of Facilities in DPW to improve the maintenance and operation of City facilities.<br>Thank you for your help in bringing Pittsburgh back from insolvency. From today forward I pledge to work with you to keep us on the path of fiscal discipline, and continuing the transformation and modernization of Pittsburgh city government.” | 13/11/2017 09:20:16 |
| Pittsburgh Selected to Develop Financial Counseling as Free Public Service for Low-Income Residents | _Pittsburgh Chosen to Receive Support from Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund and Bloomberg Philanthropies to Replicate Proven FEC Public Municipal Financial Counseling Model_<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (November 14, 2017) The City of Pittsburgh and the national [Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund](http://www.cfefund.org/) (CFE Fund) announced today their selection to replicate the proven Financial Empowerment Center (FEC) model under the new FEC Public national platform.  Pittsburgh will receive technical assistance and a seed grant to bring free, high-quality, one-on-one financial counseling to Pittsburgh residents. The CFE Fund’s FEC Public program is supported by a $7,750,000 investment from Bloomberg Philanthropies as part of their American Cities initiative.  <br>“This is a key initiative to help make sure Pittsburgh offers opportunity for all. On behalf of the residents of Pittsburgh I want to thank the CFE Fund and Bloomberg Philanthropies for this latest charitable contribution to our city,” Mayor William Peduto said. <br>“Financial Empowerment Centers are exactly the kind of bold idea that should spread between cities. It is a proven model that helps low-income citizens and we are delighted to be doubling- down on our investment in this initiative,” said James Anderson, head of Government Innovation at Bloomberg Philanthropies. <br>“Local leaders know first-hand the connection between family financial stability and community financial stability,” said Jonathan Mintz, President and CEO of the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund. “Mayor Peduto and the city of Pittsburgh are joining a national movement to bring free, high-quality financial counseling as a public service to their residents; we are proud to partner with Mayor Peduto and Bloomberg Philanthropies on this critical work.”  <br>The national FEC Public platform promotes scale and sustainability for the growing movement of professional, one-on-one financial counseling as a free public service. The CFE Fund is seeding additional FEC replication multiple avenues of grant support, intensive technical assistance, and a vibrant national learning community, which will help as many as 50 local government partners plan, launch, and sustain free financial counseling for their residents. First piloted in New York City under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2008, the FECs have worked with almost 80,000 clients, helping them reduce individual debt by almost $99 million, and increasing their families’ savings by close to $9 million. In addition, a recent CFE Fund evaluation showed that this program works even for residents with very low incomes and other complex financial challenges. Pittsburgh is one of twelve localities selected to receive a grant and intensive technical assistance to prepare to launch a local FEC program.  <br>Financial Empowerment Centers (FECs) offer professional, one-on-one financial counseling as a free public service. At the Financial Empowerment Centers, professionally trained FEC counselors help individuals and families with low and moderate incomes manage their finances, pay down debt, increase savings, establish and build credit, and access safe and affordable mainstream banking products. At the core of the FEC model is the integration of counseling into other social services, including housing and foreclosure prevention, workforce development, prisoner reentry, benefits access, domestic violence services, and more.  <br>FEC Evaluation Findings <br>Earlier this year, the CFE Fund released [An Evaluation of Financial Empowerment Centers: Building People’s Financial Stability As a Public Service](http://cfefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FEC-Evaluation.pdf), a three-year evaluation of the initiative’s initial replication in 5 cities (Denver, CO; Lansing, MI; Nashville, TN; Philadelphia, PA and San Antonio, TX). The evaluation shows that the model worked in a variety of city contexts, and that clients succeeded in reducing debt, increasing their savings, establishing and improving credit, and opening safe banking accounts, despite deep financial challenges.  <br>The evaluation draws on data from 22,000 clients who participated in 57,000 counseling sessions across the first 5 city replication partners over 30 months. As further evidence of the program’s success, evaluation findings include: <br>- FEC clients succeeded. Overall, these FEC clients reduced their debt by $22.5 million, increased their savings by $2.7 million, and nearly a quarter of unscored clients working on credit issues succeeded in establishing a credit score. <br>  <br>- FEC clients succeeded despite deep financial challenges. FEC clients averaged annual incomes of only about $21,000; they were twice as likely as all U.S. consumers to have a subprime credit score and half as likely to even have a credit score; nearly 23% had no health insurance; and over 60% had no savings.  <br>  <br>- FEC clients meaningfully reduced debt. While FEC clients began counseling with an average of nearly $29,000 in debt —more than half with credit card accounts, 40% with utility debt, and 38% with student loans—over a third of clients who tried to reduce their debt succeeded, with total debt reduction at $22.5 million. <br>  <br>- FEC clients meaningfully built savings. FEC clients were much more likely than average US residents to have no savings, yet overall, almost a third of clients working to increase their savings succeeded, averaging $1,634 and totaling $2.7 million among just those included in the evaluation. <br>  <br>- Banking status matters. Unbanked FEC clients had a notably more difficult time achieving financial outcomes, underscoring the importance of a bank account. Compared to clients with accounts, they were less than half as likely to increase their savings, and over a third less likely to establish a new credit score, even working directly and repeatedly with a counselor in efforts to do so. <br>  <br>- The FEC model worked in a variety of city contexts. The evaluation documents replication success across 5 different American cities. Critical, well-replicated features of the model included programmatic emphasis on public-private partnerships, building rapport and prioritizing the clients’ goals, encouraging return sessions, and professionalism through data-driven management and professional training. <br>  <br>**About the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFE Fund)**<br>The CFE Fund supports municipal efforts to improve the financial stability of households by leveraging opportunities unique to local government. By translating cutting edge experience with large scale programs, research, and policy in cities of all sizes, the CFE Fund assists mayors and other local leaders to identify, develop, fund, implement, and research pilots and programs that help families build assets and make the most of their financial resources. The CFE Fund works in partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies and other generous sponsors to support our work.  For more information, please visit [www.cfefund.org](http://www.cfefund.org/) or follow us on Twitter at @CFEFund.  <br>_Media Contact:_<br>_Joel Moore_<br>_[joel.moore@hkstrategies.com](mailto:joel.moore@hkstrategies.com)_<br>_212.885.0468_ | 14/11/2017 14:11:33 |

| Mayor William Peduto Introduces Bill Requiring $15 An Hour Jobs on City Contracts | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 20, 2017) Mayor William Peduto today introduced legislation to Pittsburgh City Council requiring all those receiving major city contracts to pay their full time workers a minimum of $15 an hour. <br>The legislation follows on [his November 2015 executive order](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=1088) requiring the city to pay all its full time city employees at least $15 an hour. It was phased in over five years, starting this year.<br>The ordinance introduced today would apply to all those receiving City contracts worth $100,000 or more. <br>"Today's legislation shows my commitment to making sure Pittsburgh remains a city in which everyone can afford to live comfortably through sustainable wages," Mayor Peduto said. <br>The ordinance covers all professional service contracts let by the City that exceed $100,000 and are paid completely by city funds. It requires employers to maintain records showing their compliance with the wage rule and make the records available at the City's request. <br>“With income inequality growing and far too many Americans working for poverty wages under $15/hour, we’re grateful for the leadership of Mayor Peduto, continuing to ensure the city does everything in its power to create good jobs for all Pittsburgers," said Sam Williamson, District Leader 32BJ SEIU. <br>Violations of the requirements will be considered a breach of contract and the City will be allowed to seek damages from such contractors. <br>The legislation is expected to have no effect on the City's budget. <br>A copy of the ordinance [is available here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/1006_$15%20Ordinance.docx). | 20/11/2017 10:03:28 |

| IMG Delivers Final Report to Blue Ribbon Panel on Proposed PWSA Restructuring | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 27, 2017) Infrastructure Management Group today issued its final report on a possible restructuring of the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority to Mayor William Peduto's Blue Ribbon Panel of water experts.  <br>The panel – working independently from PWSA and City government – has been meeting to discuss IMG's findings and is expected to provide its recommendations for restructuring the authority to Mayor Peduto by the end of December. <br>The IMG "Restructuring Assessment" report [is available here](https://pwsablueribbon.org/). It recommends transferring oversight of PWSA to a Board of Trustees, which in turn would name a Board of Directors to oversee PWSA operations. Both bodies would be independent of City government, through the recommendations keep PWSA ownership and rate-setting within public hands. <br>Additionally the report addresses needed reforms to PWSA operations and infrastructure. It recommends that operations be overseen by a public operator (possibly PWSA) that is subject by contract to stringent performance standards, and that the authority's vast needs for infrastructure improvements be overseen by a private partner to keep likely cost overruns from impacting PWSA ratepayers. <br>The Restructuring Assessment executive summary states:  <br>"As this report explains, each of the restructuring options has its advantages, and each has its own viable form of public accountability and quality-assurance mechanisms, some stronger than others. However, PWSA’s organizational problems are large and long-standing, and its infrastructure needs threaten to overwhelm the pocketbooks of the city’s water and sewer ratepayers. Business as usual, even along the current improvement path, is simply insufficient against these enormous challenges. <br>IMG has recommended a combination approach, one that maintains public ownership, operations, and rate-setting while selecting the most beneficial aspects of each restructuring option and forging them into a powerful synthesis, one that relies on politically-independent governance and contract driven public and private performance. We believe this 'best of the best' approach will not only solve PWSA’s persistent organizational and performance problems durably and efficiently but also enhance Pittsburgh’s national reputation as a leader in public-service innovation." <br>Section 4 of the report addresses community input on IMG's work, including a November 2 public forum attended by 200 people. A workshop at the forum concluded that in a PWSA restructuring, residents most valued accountability, cost and green infrastructure from the authority. <br>Mayor Peduto named the Blue Ribbon Panel in March of this year to address longstanding concerns with PWSA water quality, operations and infrastructure. IMG was selected to deliver recommendations to the panel, and the firm began its work in July. | 27/11/2017 13:40:13 |

| Pittsburgh Launches Public Safety Multicultural Liaison Unit | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 29, 2017) The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety has launched its Multicultural Liaison Unit, a community policing and immigration integration strategy, Mayor William Peduto announced today. <br>The MLU was proposed in the Mayor's 2014 [Welcoming Pittsburgh plan](http://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/welcoming-pgh/index.html) and further established through legislation introduced early this year by Councilman Dan Gilman. <br>The unit is comprised of members of the Mayor's Office, Public Safety and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, who work closely with members of the Welcoming Pittsburgh Advisory Committee to ensure consistent community input and community-driven solutions.  <br>The MLU's mission is to build trustworthy and sustainable relationships among Public Safety employees (first responders) and the immigrant and refugee communities through proactive and community-driven strategies. Currently, within these communities, there can be a lack of trust toward Public Safety employees. As a result, crimes and safety concerns are not properly reported; emergency medical care is not requested; and new residents are unable to comfortably integrate into their communities. The lack of protection felt by foreign born residents has allowed this community to prioritize its fears ahead of receiving the required, and deserved, protection and service provided by the City of Pittsburgh’s Pubic Safety employees.  <br>"Pittsburgh's past was built by immigrants, and so will its future. This unit will be key to making sure all of those in our city feel welcome, especially when interacting with the first responders who so often are the first government faces to come into contact with Pittsburgh newcomers," Mayor Peduto said. <br>"I want to thank Mayor Peduto and Public Safety Director Hissrich for acting quickly to establish the Multicultural Liaison Unit, which was created under my City for All legislative package," said Councilman Gilman. "By translating documents into several languages, boosting outreach efforts, and advancing cultural understanding among all public safety personnel, this unit will help officers to more effectively protect and serve Pittsburgh's growing immigrant and refugee communities and build a safer and more welcoming city for all."  <br>"Pittsburgh is a multi-cultural city. There is value to building understanding between our diverse communities and our Public Safety employees. We look forward to the successes that are sure to come from this important initiative," said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. <br>Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said, "This effort will improve the capacity of our officers to serve the increasingly diverse residents of the City of Pittsburgh and to continue to strengthen community ties in our efforts to reduce crime." <br>The Public Safety Multicultural Liaison Unit aims to diminish current fears by actively engaging the immigrant and refugee community members through three essential initiatives: communication and language access, outreach and education, and multicultural trainings. <br>**Communication and Language Access**<br>Welcoming Pittsburgh conducted a series of community meetings and through feedback from those meetings, meetings with other stakeholders within the immigrant and refugee communities, and further research. The City was able to conclude that there was a lack of knowledge on Public Safety laws and ordinances amongst the immigrant and refugee community members. A language barrier was identified as the primary reason for this lack of knowledge. <br>Although there are many languages represented within the City of Pittsburgh, the unit will focus on the five most common languages among immigrant communities: 1) Arabic 2) Chinese 3) Nepalese 4) Spanish and 5) Swahili. <br>Watch and Learn videos will be accessible through the City of Pittsburgh website, our social media platforms, and our national partners (i.e. Welcoming America). These brief videos will feature Pubic Safety employees from Police, Fire, and Emergency Medical Services simplistically explaining basic laws and protocol, how to request emergency services, fire prevention and any other information deemed important by the Department of Public Safety. The videos will be recorded in English; however, subtitles in the six identified languages will be included at the bottom of the screen. In addition, voiceovers of the six identified languages will be created as well. Each language will have its own series of Watch and Learn videos.  <br>Public Safety literature will be translated and disseminated at community meetings and outreach events. Translated literature will be available for leaders within the immigrant and refugee community to duplicate and house at various facilities within their communities.  <br>**Outreach and Education**<br>Outreach and Education initiatives are critical to the success of the Multicultural Liaison Unit, with outreach efforts intended to be immersed in the communities where different immigrant and refugee populations are located. To build connections with the communities the City will plan events within the region of the specific immigrant and refugee populations.  <br>The programming will include, but not be limited to: 1) Public Safety Community Meetings: These meetings are generally requested by community leaders to cover a selected topic to address a current community need. Community members will have the opportunity to learn more about Public Safety services and ask Public Safety related questions. 2) Know Your Rights Sessions: A collaboration with various City departments, community leaders, community organizations and legal counsel for immigrant and refugee community members 3) Lunch and Learn: Once a week, community members will learn about Public Safety related topics such as traffic safety education, emergency and non-emergency calls, reporting options, how to become a Public Safety employee, etc. 4) Immigrant and Refugee Public Safety Academy: The academy will be a replica of the Citizens Police Academy offered by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. 5) Social Engagements: Police officers will engage with the community by participating in friendly competitions of sports (i.e. basketball, soccer etc.) suggested by the community members. <br>**Multicultural Trainings**<br>Multicultural training will be incorporated into the new recruit training for each of the Public Safety Bureaus. These trainings will help first responders effectively address and support the public safety needs of residents with various cultural backgrounds and limited English language skills. <br>Multicultural Overviews for each Police Zone will provide information about the various nationalities represented in that zone. The objective is to help officers understand, respect and appropriately respond to cultural norms when interacting with immigrant and refugee community members. Initial outreach efforts will take place in the following communities identified as those with most need: East Liberty, North Side, Northview Heights, Oakland, South Hills (Carrick). <br>**Timeline**<br>For the duration of 2017 the unit is working closely with Police, Fire, EMS, Welcoming Pittsburgh Advisory Council and community leaders to design programming and implantation strategies for the three areas of focus. During this time, the Multicultural Unit will also complete a department-wide literature assessment to determine additional Public Safety educational resources to translate. Translated material will be available for upcoming community meetings and social engagement events. <br>2018 Quarter 1: <br>- Community meetings and social engagement events  <br>  <br>- Lunch and Learn workshops <br>  <br>- Know Your Rights Session <br>  <br>- Watch and Learn Videos recorded, translated, edited and published to website for viewing  <br>  <br>2018 Quarter 2 and beyond:  <br>- Community meetings and social engagement events  <br>  <br>- Lunch and Learn workshops <br>  <br>- Know Your Rights Session <br>  <br>- Multicultural Trainings   <br>  <br>**Conclusion**<br>The efforts mentioned above will expand within the Bureau of Police and with other emergency responders. These critically important City employees present the first opportunity to develop more culturally aware and empathetic interactions with immigrants, and provide the language access resources that Federal funding mandates in serving English learners.  <br>Developing effective programs and working with first-line emergency providers will provide an important first step in expanding awareness and training throughout all City departments and staff. The Mayor’s Office will work to ensure continuing input, improvements, and partnership with employees who will be on the front lines of implementing, participating, and enforcing the program. The expanded practices and training tools will be made available to the public and partners as a means of ensuring broad support and compliance in building accessible, culturally empathetic resources, beyond City government. | 29/11/2017 12:44:25 |

Mayor Peduto is also a panelist for a discussion on America's Pledge, highlighting the commitment to uphold the goals of the Paris Agreement. <br>The North American Climate Summit is an extension of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, [described](https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/about/) as "an international alliance of cities and local governments with a shared long-term vision of promoting and supporting voluntary action to combat climate change and move to a low emission, resilient society." <br>The inaugural North American Climate Summit will feature the 5th annual [C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards](http://www.c40.org/awards). As described by Bloomberg Philanthropies, "the C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards are granted annually in five categories and provide global recognition for cities that are demonstrating climate action leadership."  <br>Since 2013, C40 has recognized more than 40 of the world’s boldest projects, highlighting the critical role cities play as a leading force for climate action through the C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies. For 2017, 93 Cities submitted 174 applications. The applications were evaluated through a rigorous scoring process and an independent jury panel selected the 10 winners. <br>Given the increasingly important role cities must play in driving climate action in the United States, the C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards 2017 will have a special focus on the leadership of US cities on the global stage. Each category will have a winner from an American city and a city from the rest of the world. <br>A schedule of events and agenda for the Global Covenant of Mayors North American Climate Summit can be found [here](https://northamericanclimatesummit.splashthat.com/).

Current forecasts predict that this Level 2 snow event is expected to be a quick moving storm dropping 2” to 4” of snow over a 15 hour period. The Snow Plow Tracker was active until 2:00 p.m. today with coverage information from the previous Level 1 Snow event that began on December 12 and was scheduled to last until 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, December 14. As of 3:00 p.m. today, the Snow Plow Tracker will display coverage for the new Level 2 Snow Alert.  <br>All crews have been extended to 12 hour shifts during the snow event. As snowfall is expected to overlap with the evening rush hour, crews are actively pre-treating streets with a liquid Calcium Chloride and salt mix. Approximately 70 vehicles equipped with plows and chains will be deployed throughout the city throughout the evening then 60 vehicles will work through the night.  <br>During a [Level Two Snow Alert](http://pittsburghpa.gov/weather/snow-levels.html), DPW has a 32 hour window after the snow event ends to clear the streets before individual constituent calls for service will be addressed. This current snow event is expected to last from 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday until 6:00 a.m. on Thursday, December 14, giving crews until 2:00 a.m. on Saturday, December 16 to have all city streets treated. DPW will be following the primary, secondary and tertiary plowing routes exclusively until the early morning hours on Thursday. <br>**Winter Storm Levels & 311 Response Center**<br>The Department of Public Works classifies storm conditions into  [Winter Storm Levels](http://pittsburghpa.gov/weather/snow-levels.html). Levels determine the required response timeframe for a given snowstorm. Based on the storm levels, it will be expected that all streets will be serviced with clearly defined response times. <br>Depending on the severity or level of the weather event it can take up to 48 hours to treat the streets with salt and/or calcium chloride after a snow/ice event. <br>- Level 1 Event (1 - 3"): Crews have 24 hours after the storm has ended to treat streets. <br>- Level 2 Event (3 - 6"): Crews have 32 hours after the storm has ended to treat streets. <br>- Level 3 Event (6 - 10"): Crews have 48 hours after the storm has ended to treat streets. <br>- Level 4 Event (> than 10"): Calls will not be taken until weather event drops to a Level 3 (6-10"). <br>**Winter Weather Resources**<br>The City of Pittsburgh [Snow Plow Tracker](https://city.temeda.com/)  is a resource available to monitor the travel history for all vehicles dedicated to snow and ice control throughout the time frame of a snow event.<br>Residents should contact the [311 Response Center](http://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/311.html) if a street is not treated within the designated timeframe following a storm. <br>### | 13/12/2017 15:37:46 |

| Mayor William Peduto Names Dan Gilman Chief of Staff | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 19, 2017) Mayor William Peduto today named City Councilman Dan Gilman as his new Chief of Staff, effective on January 3, 2018, the day of Mayor Peduto's inauguration into his second mayoral term. <br>Gilman was elected to Council in 2013 and previously served as Chief of Staff to then-councilman Peduto in District 8, representing Oakland, Point Breeze, Shadyside and Squirrel Hill. He has long worked with Mayor Peduto on efforts to modernize Pittsburgh government, improve city services, work with business and institutional leaders to develop the city's economy, and bring opportunities to all Pittsburgh families. <br>Gilman is set to replace outgoing Chief of Staff Kevin Acklin, who announced his intention on December 7 to return to the private sector in January 2018. <br>"Dan is the perfect person to continue my and Kevin's work the last four years to make Pittsburgh a city for all. In fact, he's been integral to that work all along," Mayor Peduto said. "I am grateful to Dan and his family for taking this next step in his public service to the city." <br>"I have a passion to continue to serve the residents of the City of Pittsburgh," said Councilman Gilman. "I am thankful to Mayor Peduto for this opportunity to serve the whole city and help deliver upon our City for All agenda."  <br>The councilman, age 35, lives in Squirrel Hill with his wife Amanda and their almost 2-year-old son. He is a graduate of Shady Side Academy and Carnegie Mellon University, graduating with honors from the latter with a degree in Ethics, History, and Public Policy. He currently serves on the boards of the Sports & Exhibition Authority, Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council and the Silk Screen Film Festival. He also serves on the Board of Fellows of the University of Pittsburgh Institute of Politics. <br>Gilman was selected to join The New DEAL, a national network committed to highlighting pragmatic progressives with innovative ideas at the state and local level. He was also named Vice Chair of the National League of Cities (NLC) University Communities Council. He has been recognized as one of Pittsburgh’s “40 Under 40” by Pittsburgh Magazine and Pittsburgh Urban Magnet Project, as well as one of Pittsburgh’s “50 Finest” by Whirl Magazine. <br>Further information on the councilman's legislative and policy accomplishments [is available here](http://pittsburghpa.gov/council/district8/gilman.html). <br>Gilman was reelected to a second council term on November 7, several weeks before Acklin announced his resignation. The vacancy in the District 8 seat will trigger a special election to be scheduled by the President of City Council. <br>"This wasn't an easy decision, especially given the confidence District 8 residents have given me the last two elections. I pledge to take all the lessons they have taught me over the years and apply that experience to making the entire city a better place for all," Gilman said. <br>His appointment is not subject to City Council approval. The 2018 salary for the position is $111,323. <br>### | 19/12/2017 13:23:47 |
