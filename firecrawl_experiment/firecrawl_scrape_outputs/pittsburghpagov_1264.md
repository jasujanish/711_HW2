# Community Collaborations

## Overview

In 2022 the Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition was founded by Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, Mayor Ed Gainey and twenty local service organizations with the goal of creating a community strategic plan. Mayor Ed Gainey's administration knows that there is a gap between the haves and have nots when it comes to access, availability, services and skills training. These four areas have been identified in the text of the Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition's Community Strategic Plan. Mayor Gainey recognized that while often touted as a leader in technology and livability, thanks in part to world-class universities and a booming robotics industry, supporting resources haven’t always reached all residents in the Pittsburgh region.

## The Plan

A coordinated effort led by County and City officials along with leaders from other anchor institutions provided the Pittsburgh region with the opportunity to submit well-rounded applications for enough funding to make digital equity a reality in the years to come. This plan comprehensively addresses the gaps in digital skills, low-cost high-speed internet services, as well as access to devices and technical assistance.
