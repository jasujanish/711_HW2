# CMU to Host Energy and Innovation Summit Convened by Sen. David McCormick

_June 13, 2025_

Dear Members of the Carnegie Mellon University Community:

As announced by U.S. Senator David McCormick and reported in the media, President Donald Trump is expected to attend a national Energy and Innovation Summit hosted on the CMU campus on Tuesday, July 15. This Summit, convened by Sen. McCormick, will bring together leaders from government, industry and academia for a day of conversations on technology, innovation and national strategy. Given the high-profile participants already identified, the event is likely to draw national attention and planning is underway accordingly.

This Summit, which is a result of Sen. McCormick’s advocacy and leadership to advance science and innovation, comes at a critical moment for our country. The convergence of AI and energy has profound implications for economic competitiveness, national security and global leadership. The innovations emerging today will shape the sectors of tomorrow — from power grid resilience, AI factories and computing hubs to advanced manufacturing, next-generation defense systems and sustainability transitions. Our region has long been a national center of energy production and infrastructure, and Pittsburgh has emerged as a global hub for AI, robotics and advanced technology. Carnegie Mellon University sits at the heart of this ecosystem, with our world-class expertise shaping how the country is adapting to the opportunities and challenges of this new industrial era.

As the Summit approaches, we remain committed to ensuring that the story of Carnegie Mellon’s contributions to the nation are front and center. As always, our participation in such national forums reflects our long-standing record of contributing to conversations in the rooms where futures are imagined and decisions are formed.

Since Carnegie Mellon’s founding, our university has hosted leaders for discussions that explore issues of significant national and societal importance. Similarly, we have a history of constructively engaging with the federal government and administrations across the political spectrum. We view these opportunities as consequential to elevating and advancing both Carnegie Mellon’s mission and impact, and we bring to those moments the full measure of our expertise, our values and our voice in service to the nation.

Thank you, as always, for all that you do to shape our university and extend our reach in the world.

Warm regards,

Farnam Jahanian

President

Henry L. Hillman President’s Chair Carnegie Mellon University
