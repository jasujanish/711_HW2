The vibrant arts and culture scene is alive and thriving in Pittsburgh. Throughout the city and the region, galleries and museums offer everything from cutting-edge to classic. The entertainment is endless, and the quality and variety superb.

A legacy of community investment and involvement from industrial and corporate leaders, including Andrew Carnegie, H.J. Heinz, Henry Clay Frick, Henry L. Hillman and a host of others, built the foundation of the city's rich cultural environment.

Set in the heart of the city, Downtown's lively [**Cultural District**](https://culturaldistrict.org/) is home to nine theatres that showcase a world-renowned symphony orchestra, opera, dance and award-winning plays that enliven Pittsburgh.
