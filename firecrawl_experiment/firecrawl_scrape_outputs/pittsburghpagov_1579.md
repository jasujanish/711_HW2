# Announcements

**Building & Development Application**

_Posted on: 06/13/2024_

The OneStopPGH Team is excited to announce the new Building & Development Application! **Beginning June 12th, 2024** the Building & Development Application will replace the current Zoning Development Review Application and Building Permit Application. This streamlined application consolidates the building permit and zoning application into a single, unified application. If you're planning a construction project, this will typically be your initial step. After you submit the application, we will inform you of any additional permits required to complete your project.

**Some of the important benefits of the new Building & Development Application (BDA) include:**

- **An application that requires no expertise in the construction process!** This application uses simplified prompts that ask only for information relevant to your project.
- **Inter-agency review and coordination!** Every BDA will be reviewed by each of the relevant departments. The departments will determine what is required for your project and will inform you of any additional required permits.
- **Co-applicants!** The ability to add multiple applicants to your application so that anyone can respond to requests for more information or provide revisions.
- **No more Zoning Development Review (ZDR) Application!** The reviews associated with the ZDR are now incorporated into the BDA to remove the need for you to apply twice for the same scope.

**Customer User Interface Upgrade**

_Posted on: 04/26/2024_

The OneStopPGH team is excited to announce a new customer portal upgrade! This change went live on  **Monday, March 25th.** This upgrade did not change any core functionality or application requirements. The system our users have learned is still the same, but it will now be more intuitive and easier to access.

**Some of the more notable changes are as follows:**

- Modern design standards for **increased accessibility and ease of use**;
- Better hosting with modern software will lead to **faster loading and platform stability**;
- **Multi-device support:** OneStopPGH will be more accessible than over on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and PCs.

**Coming Soon:**

- **Automatic Language Translation** to make OneStopPGH more accessible to those whose primary language isn’t English **.**

**New tutorials for the upgraded customer portal can be found [here.](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/OneStopPGH/OneStopPGH-Tutorials)**
