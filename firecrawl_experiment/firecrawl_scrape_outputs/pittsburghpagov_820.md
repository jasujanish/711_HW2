# Occupancy Only Permit

_The Commercial Building Permit is now part of the [Building and Development Application](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/OneStopPGH/Building-Development-Application)!_

A residential occupancy-only permit is required for the following work on a residential building or structure (single-family or two-family dwelling):

- To certify a new use and/or occupancy for an existing building or structure.
- Approve temporary use and/or occupancy of an existing building or structure.

Please see [Permit Home](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/Permits) for the definition of residential structures and work types. Please see [Work Not Requiring A Permit](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/Permits/Work-Not-Requiring-a-Permit) for work that can be performed without a PLI permit.
