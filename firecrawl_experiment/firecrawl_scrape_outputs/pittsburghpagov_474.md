## Introduction

Welcome to Pittsburgh’s 8th Council District and the Office of Councilperson Erika Strassburger. District 8 contains a collection of vibrant neighborhoods in Pittsburgh’s East End: Oakland, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill. Please explore our website for information on City services, legislation, office initiatives, and more.

## Our Neighborhoods

**Oakland**(show below)

Oakland is the cultural and educational center of Pittsburgh. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Carnegie Museums of Natural History and Art are all located in this large neighborhood that borders Squirrel Hill and Shadyside. Oakland enjoys a very diverse population. Students from the four prestigious universities located here hail from more than ninety countries and coexist with longtime Oakland residents throughout the densely populated neighborhood. The neighborhood contains business districts along Forbes and Fifth Avenues and the side streets that connect them as well as Craig Street.

**Shadyside**(show below)

Located in the heart of Pittsburgh’s East End, Shadyside is home to a mix of families, young professionals, artists, and students. This dense neighborhood contains three bustling business districts on Walnut Street, Ellsworth Avenue, and South Highland Avenue. The neighborhood is home to a beautiful patchwork of stately Victorian mansions, well-maintained apartment and condominium buildings, and contemporary homes.

**Squirrel Hill**(show below)

Historically considered the home of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community, Squirrel Hill still maintains its strong Jewish heritage even as a younger and more diverse population has moved into the neighborhood. Squirrel Hill residents enjoy the rare combination of urban amenities, such as a walkable and lively business district along Murray and Forbes Avenues, and large homes with sizable front lawns and backyards. Also located in Squirrel Hill is the beautiful campus of Chatham University.
