# Acceptance of Service of Process

The Law Department is the office that accepts Service of Process of Legal Papers (e.g., Writs, Injunctions, Complaints, etc.) on behalf of the Mayor and the City of Pittsburgh. This office does not accept service of legal papers for any individual City employee other than the Mayor.

Any individual City of Pittsburgh employee, except for the Mayor, must be served with legal papers at their assigned duty location or office.

Further, the Law Department does not accept service for any Authorities of the City of Pittsburgh (e.g., The Pittsburgh Water & Sewer Authority (PWSA), the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Parking Authority (PPA), or the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)). These Authorities are wholly separate and distinct from the City of Pittsburgh.

Service of Subpoenas on individual City Departments and employees must be served at the office where the employee is assigned and/or the records are located. A convenience copy of the subpoena should be provided to the Law Department.
