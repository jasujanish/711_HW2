# Plastic Bag Ban & Paper Bag Fee

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dpw/images/21932_1.png)

### Why ban plastic bags and mandate a fee for paper bags?

The City of Pittsburgh is committed fostering a clean and sustainable community by reducing waste and litter. In April 2022, Pittsburgh City Council unanimously passed an ordinance **banning plastic bags** and requiring at least **10** ¢ **be charged for paper bags.**

Plastic bags are problematic through their lifecycle - they are made from non-renewable resources, often used just once, are hard to recycle, and do not biodegrade. They litter sidewalks and parks, clog storm drains and recycling machinery, and contaminate soil and water with microplastics. Paper bags, while recyclable, are still resource-intensive to produce and studies in other cities show that charging a fee decreases their use.

_This webpage is intended to provide information to the public and help businesses ensure they are compliant with the ordinance. We encourage you to read it thoroughly, utilize the available resources, and reach out if you need assistance. A PDF of frequently asked questions can be found here: [Plastic Bag Ordinance FAQ(PDF, 286KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/2/dpw/documents/anti-litter/plastic-bag-ordinance-faq.pdf "here") .
