Romare moved to Pittsburgh from New York City with his grandparents and learned to draw from a neighbor and later went on to college. Romare's art often depicted Pittsburgh neighborhoods. Romare Bearden is a featured artist in the the Roving Art Cart's "Meet the Masters" series. Romare created "Pittsburgh Recollections" for the original Gateway T-Station in Pittsburgh. Children attending can create a neighborhood collage.
