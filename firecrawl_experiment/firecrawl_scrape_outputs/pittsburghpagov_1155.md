## About the Stormwater Review Process

The purpose of the Stormwater Plan Review is to manage runoff and encourage natural infiltration and ensure all proposed development complies with federal, state, and local regulations.

**What is the purpose of stormwater code?**(show below)

- Managing stormwater runoff from land alteration and disturbance activities in accordance with watershed management plans.
- Assuring that development activities do not result in increased stormwater flows.
- Utilizing and preserving the desirable existing drainage system by preserving the flood capacity of streams.
- Stream quality maintenance and improvement in accordance with watershed management.
- Encouraging natural infiltration of rainfall to preserve groundwater recharge.
- Managing stormwater runoff close to the source, reducing runoff volumes, and mimicking pre-development hydrology.
- Ensuring proper operation and maintenance of all Stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the City.

**When is a stormwater plan required?**(show below)

Stormwater Plan Reviews are triggered by one or more of the following:

- 10,000 sq. ft. of land disturbance (any grading, excavation, or fill activities that occur on a site) or 5,000 sq. ft. increase in impervious surface.
- 5,000 sq. ft. of land disturbance (any grading, excavation, or fill activities that occur on a site) subject to the Project Development Plans or Site Plan Review standards of the RIV Zoning District per 905.04.F.

**How long will the process take?**(show below)

Conceptual review has a minimum 15-day review period. Any revisions required will extend this process.

Site plan/technical review has a minimum 45-day review period. Any revisions required will extend this process.

**What is required for a Stormwater Plan review?**(show below)

**Stormwater Conceptual Review:**

- Cover Sheet
- Introduction/Executive Summary
- Existing Conditions
- Site plan and proposed Improvements consistent with Zoning Site Plan Submission
- Proposed BMPs and locations
- Post-construction stormwater management drainage areas
- Proposed volume control offsets, rate control POIs, volume or rate incentives, innovation tracks, performance points, or technological incentives
- Technical infeasibility determination, if applicable
- Conclusion
- Appendices

**Stormwater Site Plan Review:**

- Cover Sheet
- Overall stormwater management concept
- Site conditions, including any environmentally sensitive areas
- Stormwater runoff design computations and documentation
- Soil erosion and sediment control plan, where applicable, and proof of submission to ACCD
- Expected project schedule.
- Effect of the project on surrounding properties
- Plan and profile drawings of BMPs
- Locations of existing and proposed on-lot wastewater facilities and water supply wells, property boundaries, existing and proposed topography, point(s) of interest, utilities, and potential utility conflicts
- Justification for use of non-preferred BMPs, if applicable
- Proposed volume control offsets, rate control POIs, volume or rate incentives, innovation tracks, performance points, or technological incentives
- Technical infeasibility locations, if applicable
- Easements, Right-of-Way, Deed Restrictions
- Other Permits/Approvals
- Operations and Maintenance Program
- Infiltration testing and geotechnical testing investigation report
- Conclusion
- Appendices

**How do I start the process?**(show below)

- Submit S **tormwater Permit application** through [OneStopPGH](https://onestoppgh.pittsburghpa.gov/pghprod/pub/lms/Login.aspx)


  - **Phase I: Conceptual Review** – with DCP Environmental Review Staff
  - **Phase II: Site Plan Review** – with PLI Plan Review Staff
  - **Stormwater Permit Issuance** – Valid for 5 years
- **Modifications/Re-submissions** — Any changes to a submitted Final Stormwater Management Plan require a re-submission and approval.

**How do I end the process?**(show below)

After you have resolved any issues, a stormwater permit will be issued. A permit holder must work with PLI staff to schedule the required preconstruction, underground, and final inspections.

**Zoning and Building Codes**(show below)

- [All SWM BMPs shall be installed per the 2015 International Plumbing Code](https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IPC2015P4)
