# Policies and Procedural Manual

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/public-safety/images/5524_pd.png)**City of Pittsburgh**

**Bureau of Police**

**Office of the Chief**

**“honor, integrity, courage, respect, compassion”**

All policies are issued and signed by the Chief of Police. The policies have been put in place to ensure ethical and professional conduct on the part of the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police; to ensure equitable and constitutional enforcement of law; and to ensure that all members are dedicated to the principles of Procedural Justice:

- Voice
- Neutrality
- Respect
- Trustworthiness

Our proud participation in the National Initiative for Building Community Trust & Justice has solidified our long-held belief that our legitimacy as law enforcement is contingent upon many factors, including transparency. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police believes strongly in being transparent. Transparency fosters trust.

To achieve transparency, we believe that it is important that we provide the public with the opportunity to review our policies with regards to how your Police Officers may interact with the community.

Police work is unpredictable. There is no all-encompassing formula for dealing with every facet of human behavior or situation that law enforcement encounters on a daily basis. The Manual of Procedural Orders establish guidelines for the performance expected by all members of the Police Bureau. It is my belief that with these guidelines, our officer’s training and our desire to serve the public trust, we will professionally serve all residents and visitors to our wonderful city.

## Policy Redactions

Regarding policy redactions:

Listed below are the reasons some policies may feature redactions:

1. Confidential or internal phone numbers, emails, and web addresses used by members of the Police Bureau.
2. Sensitive information that may compromise the safety of citizens, crime victims, and/or members of the Police Bureau; specific information in regards to weaponry, tactics, and/or response methods that could compromise the safe and expeditious manner in which the Bureau may address ongoing investigations.
3. Per the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the City of Pittsburgh and the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #1, personnel matters regarding discipline.
