# Pittsburgh: A Craft Beverage Destination

Pittsburgh and the surrounding region have been fighting for craft beverage since 1794, dating back to the infamous Whiskey Rebellion, and it remains a premier craft beverage destination with a wide range of tastebud-enticing, thirst-quenching options, including local craft beers, spirits, cider, mead, wine and coffee.

## Craft Beer

With 50+ craft breweries, it’s no wonder that Pittsburgh has been continually been recognized as a [top destination for beer lovers](https://www.chowhound.com/1687835/best-beer-cities-us/).

[**East End Brewing Company**](https://www.eastendbrewing.com/) in the Larimer neighborhood is another great longstanding option.

East End Brewing’s You Are Here series is an ongoing project, started in 2019, to craft a beer for each of Pittsburgh’s 90 neighborhoods.
