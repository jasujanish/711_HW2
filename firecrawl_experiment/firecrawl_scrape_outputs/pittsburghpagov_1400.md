# Building Codes

## Uniform Construction Code

Construction in Pennsylvania, including the City of Pittsburgh, is regulated by the [Pennsylvania Construction Code Act or PA Act No. 45 of 1999](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/CH/PUBLIC/ucons_pivot_pge.cfm?session=1999&session_ind=0&act_nbr=0045.&pl_nbr=0491), which is also commonly referred to as the Uniform Construction Code (UCC). The UCC adopts, in whole or part, the International Code Council’s (ICC) I-Codes.

## Current Codes

The 2018 Base and 2018 Accessibility Codes are currently adopted under the PCCA/UCC. For more information please see PLI's [2015 Code Deadline and 2018 Code Adoption(PDF, 525KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/pli/documents/19713_p-2021-04_2018_adoption.pdf).

## Pittsburgh Amendments

The City of Pittsburgh's adoption and amendment of the UCC is documented under [Section 1002 of the Pittsburgh City Code](https://ecode360.com/45464386#45464402). These local amendments remain applicable as the UCC is updated by the Commonwealth. While the City Ordinances reference specific 2003 I-code code sections, these amendments are enforced by PLI based on the code provision and/or topic.

## Plumbing Code

Please note that PLI does not enforce the plumbing code provisions of the UCC. Please see [Allegheny County Health Department’s Plumbing Program](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Services/Health-Department/Plumbing-Program) for plumbing code permits and regulations.
