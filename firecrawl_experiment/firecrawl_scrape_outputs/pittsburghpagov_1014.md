# Performance Point Process Guide

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dcp/images/21793_performance_points_zoning_june2023.jpg)The Performance Points System encourages new developments to embrace innovation and contribute to neighborhood livability. Projects can earn points that increase their density by incorporating City of Pittsburgh and community priorities such as affordable housing, public art, and energy-efficient design. This points system is part of the City’s Zoning Code ( [Section 915.07](https://library.municode.com/pa/pittsburgh/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PIZOCO_TITNINEZOCO_ARTVIDEST_CH915ENPEST_915.07PEPOSY)) and is used within a number of districts as listed below and mapped. For each performance point, up to an additional fifteen (15) feet in building height is earned (up to the area’s height maximum).

Performance Points will be evaluated and approved as a component of the Zoning Application (ZDR) and the required material will be expected with the initial application material for the ZDR case in the [OneStopPGH](https://pittsburghpa.gov/onestoppgh/) online application portal. Applicants intending to seek Performance Points are encouraged to note that in the [Pre-Application](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Zoning/Planning-Application-and-Process/Pre-Application-Meeting) request info. Some Performance Points will require a specific Pre-Application meeting and staff will schedule that accordingly.

As more process guides are developed and approved by the City, we will add them to this site.
