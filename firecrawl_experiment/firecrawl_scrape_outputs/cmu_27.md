# Deans

As one of the most innovative and creative learning and research environments, Carnegie Mellon is fortunate to have exceptional academic leadership at the helm of its schools, colleges and international programs. Through the Office of the Provost, university deans oversee the delivery of the transformative educational experience that makes Carnegie Mellon a world renowned institution. All deans report directly to the provost.
