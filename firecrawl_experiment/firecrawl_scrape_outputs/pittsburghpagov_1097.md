## **Board of Appeals "BOA"**

Under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code, a property owner or their agent, may file a variance request with the Board of Appeals. The Board accepts variances for the following reasons:

- The true intent of the Uniform Construction Code was incorrectly interpreted.
- The provisions of the Uniform Construction Code do not apply.
- An equivalent form of construction is to be used.

## **Board of License and Inspection Review "LIR"**

The purpose of the Board of License and Inspection Review ("LIR Board") is to ensure independent oversight to the license and property maintenance inspection determinations reached by the PLI's License Officer and Code Officials.

The LIR Board adjudicates appeals of orders, decisions, or determinations related to Title VII, Business Licensing, and Title X, Building, Chapter 1004, International Property Maintenance Code ("IPMC"), of the Pittsburgh City Code. After hearing the appeal, the LIR Board will affirm, modify, reverse, vacate, or revoke the notice, order, or action from which an appeal is taken.

Visit the [LIR Board web page](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Permits-Licenses-and-Inspections/Appeals/Board-of-License-and-Inspection-Review) to get an application, read the bylaws and rules and regulations, see current members, and get meeting dates and agendas.
