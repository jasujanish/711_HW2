## New Grand Prix Highlights

With the 129-year-old Panther Hollow Bridge closed for repairs, PVGP shifting gears and introducing two thrilling new track events for this year’s races.

**Panther Hollow Hillclimb**

Kicking off near Phipps Conservatory, this intense 1-mile hill climb charges up the historic, stone-walled Circuit Drive, winding through the park to the Bob O’Connor Golf Course. Fans will have a chance to get up close with muscle cars, historic one-offs, stock cars, and vintage racers, all paddocked in front of Phipps and the Visitors Center and along Schenley Drive for an interactive experience.

**Schenley Oval Circuit**

This exciting new 2-mile racecourse follows our legendary route along the Boulevard of the Allies, tackling the iconic hay bale chicane, veering left just before the Panther Hollow Bridge. From there, racers snake up Overlook Drive, glide past the ice rink and Schenley Oval, and descend onto Greenfield Road. Two quick lefts send them back onto the Boulevard for another high-speed lap. Packed with technical turns, this dynamic circuit stays true to our tradition of vintage road racing through the heart of a city park. Stay tuned for updates and details on these thrilling new races at the [PVGP website](https://pvgp.org/).
