# Mayor Gainey Will Sign Declaration of Disaster Emergency for FHB

**Mayor Ed Gainey Will Sign Declaration of Disaster Emergency for Fern Hollow Bridge Collapse**

_City of Pittsburgh announces intention to become a party to NTSB investigation_

**PITTSBURGH** — Mayor Ed Gainey will sign a Declaration of Disaster Emergency for the City of Pittsburgh for the next several days. This declaration will increase the availability of federal funds, facilitate closer coordination between PennDOT and Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), and expedite the process of cleanup and reconstruction of the Fern Hollow Bridge. Mayor Gainey is also calling on the Pittsburgh City Council to extend the declaration.

Additionally, the City announced its decision to become a party to the National Transportation Safety Board’s (NTSB) investigation. Becoming a party to the investigation will allow the City and all relevant departments to share information with the NTSB in support of their independent investigation and to receive information that can be used to improve safety.

“The Fern Hollow Bridge collapse is a painful reminder of the condition of our bridges and a call to action to address our aging infrastructure,” said Mayor Gainey. “As the City of Bridges, we know how critical our infrastructure is to working families. They are the connectors to jobs, to schools, to childcare, and more. As Mayor, I want the people of Pittsburgh to know that I will be working tirelessly to secure additional funding for our infrastructure needs. With the support of our county, state, and federal partners, we will build back better.”

Frick Park is closed temporarily until the bridge collapse site can be fully secured. The city urges residents not to enter the park as it remains a hazardous site. City departments are working to re-open as much of the park as possible in the near future.

To support traffic operations and ongoing work at the project site, DOMI is modifying signal operations in the vicinity of the Forbes Avenue (Fern Hollow) Bridge detour and restricting parking access at the intersection of South Braddock and Forbes Avenue. DOMI will continue to monitor and adjust traffic operations as necessary.

To improve traffic flow, DOMI has also temporarily eliminated at least 100 feet of street parking next to Forbes/Braddock playground. Cones are currently on site to block off parking lanes as vehicles leave and towing will not be enforced. Temporary “no parking” signs will be posted on Monday.

**Traffic routes and detours are as follows:**

- Avoid the area of the Fern Hollow Bridge collapse and the intersection of Forbes Avenue and S. Braddock.
- Local drivers and residents should follow S. Dallas to Penn Avenue to S. Braddock.
- All regional traffic should use the Parkway East instead of Penn Avenue.

In the coming days and weeks, the Office of the Mayor will provide additional information about the Fern Hollow Bridge collapse as it becomes available. Until the release of its final report, **all questions** regarding the investigation, including the cause, and status of the investigation will be addressed by the NTSB.

To aid in information gathering, the NTSB is asking all witnesses to submit any pictures and videos from several days prior to the collapse to [witness@ntsb.gov](mailto:witness@ntsb.gov).
