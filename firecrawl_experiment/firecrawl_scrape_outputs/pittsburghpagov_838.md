# Zero Waste

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dpw/images/6657_zero-waste-banner.jpg)

**Pittsburgh's Journey to Zero Waste**

One of the greenest and most visible ways to manage materials sustainability is to implement the tactics of Zero Waste.

The City of Pittsburgh is working to increase its diversion and strive for Zero Waste by 2030. In an effort to accomplish this goal, it will take city-wide participation from all sectors to eliminate products that are "destined for landfill." The production and disposal of materials result in broad environmental and social impacts associated with obtaining raw materials, manufacturing and emissions from landfills.

The Zero Waste International Alliance defines zero waste as the diversion of at least 90% of waste from landfills or incineration. With help from 100 Resilient Cities, the City of Pittsburgh has developed a [Roadmap to Zero Waste(PDF, 602KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dpw/documents/543_pittsburgh-road-map-to-zero-waste-final.pdf), laying out a strategic plan to achieve this 90% diversion rate city-wide by 2030.

We’ve all heard “ **Reduce, Reuse. Recycle**” But you may not know that these waste reduction strategies are listed in order of importance or effectiveness.

It starts with prevention or reduction, and over-consumption is a key factor. It begins in the store. Whenever possible, drive to the store to pick up the item you need to reduce your cardboard and packaging usage. Then, next in order of effectiveness is reuse. This step is effective for durable goods that still have some life. Then recycling when the item needs to be broken down into its components to be made into something else. Next is energy recovery, allowing for the collection of methane gas from landfills to be used as natural gas for heating and energy or electricity from incineration. And finally, at the bottom of the inverted pyramid – disposal.

## How Will We Get There?
