# Neighborhood Plan Guide

In collaboration with public agencies and community planning partners, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning has released a finalized Neighborhood Plan Guide. The guide establishes a process for bringing together community stakeholders to create high-quality and consistent neighborhood plans. It also provides a set of standards that plans must meet to be adopted by the City’s Planning Commission and become city policy.

City Planning staff presented the guide to the Planning Commission during hearing and action in March 2020. After the presentation and public testimony, the Neighborhood Plan Guide was approved. After this approval, the City partnered with local design agency Fireman Creative to create interactive online and print materials to improve the user experience for those using the guide. These materials celebrate Pittsburgh’s many neighborhoods with pictures from each throughout.
