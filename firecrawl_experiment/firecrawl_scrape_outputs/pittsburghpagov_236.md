# Campaign Finances

## City Of Pittsburgh Campaign Finance Ordinance

The full text of the City’s most recent campaign finance regulations, including contribution limits and reporting requirements, can be found on the [eCode360 website](https://ecode360.com/PI6865).

## Campaign Finance Reporting

In accordance with Article 8, Section 802 of the [City's Home Rule Charter(PDF, 401KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/controller/documents/disclosure-of-interest-reports/2014_home_rule.pdf), candidates for mayor, City controller and City council must file a report of receipts and expenses five days prior to the primary election. Prior to the general election, candidates must file a report of receipts and expenses seven days prior to the election.

Reports of receipts and expenses are to be filed in the City controller's office.

Note: Candidates do not have to file a second report with the City in addition to the County. They may make a second copy of the report filed with the County and attach any receipts and expenditures made between the County cutoff date and the City’s.
