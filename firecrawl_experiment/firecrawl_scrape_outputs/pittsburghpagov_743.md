# Environmental Review

Due to Pittsburghâ€™s history and unique terrain, the City has several environmental conditions that can be impacted by developments, ranging from fences to new skyscrapers. These environmental conditions include steep slopes, landslide prone soils, undermined areas due to former coal mine activities, and floodplains.

To ensure that these conditions do not negatively impact proposed developments, projects may be subject to stormwater management plan review, floodplain review and/or geotechnical report review.

Learn more about stormwater review, floodplain review and geotechnical report review and check out the [Interactive Zoning Map](https://gis.pittsburghpa.gov/pghzoning/) to learn what environmental factors may impact a specific location.
