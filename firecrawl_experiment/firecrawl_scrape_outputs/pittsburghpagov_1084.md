# Cycling

**Pedal Your Heart Out!**

The Bud Harris Cycling Track is a half-mile oval loop along Washington Boulevard. It is a one-of-a-kind attraction, drawing elite cyclists and beginners to its banked corners and slight hill. Formerly a drivers' training course, the facility accommodates track and criterium racing and time trials.

The track's flat interior surface is the perfect place for kids to learn to inline skate or ride bikes or scooters.

For racing events and activities, contact the [Allegheny Cycling Association](https://www.acaracing.com/).

Call **412-255-2539** for more information.
