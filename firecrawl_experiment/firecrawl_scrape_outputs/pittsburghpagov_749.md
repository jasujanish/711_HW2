This multi-day event will kick off with online gameplay on the first day, followed by in-person matches on the second, giving young gamers the opportunity to compete for the prestigious title of "Best in the City".

This year's Pittsburgh E-Arena tournament will feature Rocket League, with 16 teams competing in Doubles mode (2v2). Teams will compete online in preliminary rounds to determine the final teams for the in-person event. Each match will last 5 minutes, excluding any overtime periods, with teams aiming to be the first to score 3 goals in a best-of-3 series.

The tournament will follow a double-elimination format, featuring both upper and lower brackets. Winners will advance in the upper bracket, while runners-up will move to the lower bracket, where a loss results in elimination from the tournament.

Trophies will be awarded to the First, Second, and Third place team members.

All participants will receive a commemorative t-shirt, complimentary food, and access to various activities sponsored by Tech 25.

Finalists will have access to Legion Gaming PCs provided by Tech 25 for gameplay, but controller players are welcome to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).
