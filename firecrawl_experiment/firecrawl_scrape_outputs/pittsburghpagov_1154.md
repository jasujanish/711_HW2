# Sustainability

Sustainability and resilience empowers all Pittsburghers to address the climate crisis through reducing pollution, improving access to food, and integrating the environment into their daily decisions. As a division, we champion preventative resilience strategies in partner operations in order to mitigate stressors facing the City and prepare for future shocks. We also advise City officials, departments and partners to enable an enduring and adaptable city through holistic decision making.

## Pittsburgh State of Sustainability

The State of Sustainability is an annual review of the performance of the Sustainability & Resilience division.
