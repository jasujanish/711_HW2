**The Gift Disclosure process is undergoing a revamp and will be down until further notice.**

The City Ethics Code requires Public Officials and Public Employees to disclose any gifts valued at over $100.00, except those received from an immediate family member. This includes gifts which, in the aggregate, total $100.00 or more from any single source.

The data displayed on the Gift Disclosure List below has been provided by the gift recipients themselves by means of a secure online form. Neither the City of Pittsburgh, the Department of Innovation and Performance or the Ethics Hearing Board have any responsibility for the contents of this gift disclosure database.
