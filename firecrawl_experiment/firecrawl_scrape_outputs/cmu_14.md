Learning for a Lifetime

# Learning for a Lifetime

Committed to improving the educational experiences in the Pittsburgh region and beyond, Carnegie Mellon University provides learning opportunities long before and after college.

Many of [CMU’s colleges](https://www.cmu.edu/academics) offer K–12 programs with a focus on a particular discipline, like the [School of Music's Preparatory School](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/preparatory-summer-programs/preparatory-school/index.html). In these ways and so many more, Carnegie Mellon helps children prepare today for what's to come tomorrow.

For many years beyond, [The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI)](http://www.cmu.edu/osher/) gives Pittsburgh adults a chance to continue their learning in non-credit, peer-led classes.

## Adults Aged 50+

Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI), formerly the Academy for Lifelong Learning, welcomes adults in the Pittsburgh area to learn more about the program.

Endowed by the Bernard Osher Foundation, OLLI at CMU is a non-credit program supported by Carnegie Mellon University since its charter in 1992.

Members participate in courses selected by the curriculum committee with suggestions from the membership.

Dedicated volunteers lead courses and manage the program. Most classes are held during daylight hours.
