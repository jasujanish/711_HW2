## Shadyside's History

Despite being a lively neighborhood today, Shadyside started with only farmland. Through the mid-1800s, the city took over Shadyside and opened a train station (some say Shadyside was named after the train’s “shady lanes”) after which many businesses and a good mix of industries moved into this neighborhood.

It was not until the 1950s that it slowly began to develop into a highly sought-after residential area with a bustling business district. The residential area is filled with a mix of affluent families, young working class, students, artists and musicians. You will find many Victorian mansions along with modern apartments and condos in a more compacted layout, making Shadyside feel like a close-knit community. Today, there are three business districts within Shadyside: Walnut St., S. Highland Ave, and Ellsworth Ave. Since all are within close walking distance of one another, it is beloved by many for its convenience and the variety of restaurants and retail that it offers.

The most popular shopping and dining district in the Shadyside neighborhood belongs to Walnut Street. The three blocks at the southwest end of the street is the heart of all the action. You have a good mix of Pittsburgh classics like Pamela’s Diner, local gems like Kards Unlimited, as well as big retail chains like Lululemon and Apple. No matter where you end up on this street, you will not be disappointed by the atmosphere and the dynamic community.

## EAT

Ok, now let's get into the good stuff: where to eat while in Shadyside. Well, you’ve got options. Below are some of my tried-and-true top picks, as well as some suggestions from locals! I have eight restaurants listed for you to try, but no matter where you decide to stop in, you will not be let down.

📍 [Georgie’s Corner Cafe](https://www.georgiescornercafe.com/) – Looking for a delicious cup of coffee and sweet treat to kickstart your day? Stop by Georgie’s Corner Cafe, my absolute go-to bakery in Shadyside with a fantastic array of breakfast and lunch options. Check out their Valrhona Chocolate Chunk Cookie and butter croissants for a guaranteed hit every time.

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271%27%20height%3D%271%27%20style%3D%27background%3Atransparent%27%2F%3E)

📍 [Café Moulin](https://cafemoulinpgh.com/) – On the topic of breakfast, Cafe Moulin is a charming French spot known for their sweet and savory crepes. The Super Belgium and the Sophia is incredible paired with their white mocha latte or freshly squeezed orange juice.

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271%27%20height%3D%271%27%20style%3D%27background%3Atransparent%27%2F%3E)

📍 [Pamela’s Diner](https://pamelasdiner.com/) – With one of its five locations in Pittsburgh, Pamela’s is an essential addition to this list. A classic Pittsburgh breakfast pick, it never fails to satisfy. It is particularly popular among Pitt students in Oakland, so stop by the Shadyside location if you can! Be sure to get their famous hotcakes and ask for your potatoes extra well-done!

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271%27%20height%3D%271%27%20style%3D%27background%3Atransparent%27%2F%3E)

📍 [Noodlehead](https://noodleheadpgh.com/) – With no surprise with this next pick, Noodlehead is an absolute crowd favorite in this neighborhood. The See Yew topped with crispy chicken is my pick every time, paired with a Thai iced tea for perfection. Plus, you get to choose your spice level from 1 to 5!

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271%27%20height%3D%271%27%20style%3D%27background%3Atransparent%27%2F%3E)

📍 [Yoshino](https://www.yoshinopittsburgh.com/) – I wondered into this cute sushi spot on Walnut St. and walked into the friendliest place with awesome vibes and music. Try one of their combo platters, with high quality fish and a variety of options, making Yoshino a fantastic spot for dinner with friends.

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271%27%20height%3D%271%27%20style%3D%27background%3Atransparent%27%2F%3E)

📍 [Senyai Thai Kitchen](https://senyaipgh.com/) – Located on Ellsworth Ave, this is another great Thai spot you need to try! It has an elegant vibe inside the restaurant, though it looks like someone’s home from the outside. I highly recommend outdoor seating in the summertime on the patio. Senyai is also BYOB, making this an excellent afternoon hangout spot! Oh, and you must get the dessert—try out the seasonal mango sticky rice to top it all off!

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271%27%20height%3D%271%27%20style%3D%27background%3Atransparent%27%2F%3E)

📍 [Nak Won Garden](https://www.facebook.com/p/Nak-Won-Garden-100054369377121/) – If you love Korean food, this is going to be your new go-to. Everything is served family style, and the indoor seating has a homey atmosphere, making it feel like you are visiting grandma's house for dinner. The menu can be overwhelming if you’ve never been, so here are my recommendations: the Beef Bibimbap and the Galbi Ribs are fantastic, the Pork Bulgogi and the Jjajangmyeon are classic comfort dishes, while the Soondubu Jjigae will hit on a cold day paired with rice.

## SHOP

After all those delicious eats, you’ll find yourself strolling around Walnut Street wondering what to do next. Don’t worry; there are plenty of places to shop. The shopping scene in Shadyside offers a fantastic mix of big-name chains and locally owned stores. With retailers like Lululemon, Sephora, Apple, Patagonia, Kendra Scott, and Banana Republic, you’ll find a selection comparable to an upscale mall.

However, the smaller local shops are the real gems of Walnut St. Many say that it’s these unique shops that bring out the warm and inviting atmosphere of the neighborhood. [Kards Unlimited](https://www.kardsunlimited.com/), a well-known classic that has been around for nearly six decades, is a must-visit. Filled with books, cards, and gifts, it’s an essential stop on your Shadyside adventure.

A recent addition to Walnut Street is [Amazing Books and Records](http://www.amazingbooksandrecords.com/hours--locations.html), which relocated from Downtown in April. Boasting affordable prices and a great ambiance, this bookstore is a paradise for book lovers. Having been voted best in Pittsburgh, Amazing Books and Records is a great new addition to the Shadyside community.

After chatting with some of the employees at Amazing Books and Records, a topic of interest emerged: the recent impact of rising rent prices on Walnut Street. Former GAP manager Daniel Meyer shared his perspective on how the closure of GAP has affected local businesses. “Well, it’s definitely slowed down the traffic on this street, especially on this end of Walnut Street. We’ve had 5 different stores close since the start of the year as a result to rent going up.”

The famous retailer's branding has been removed from the two-level Gap location at 5436 Walnut St., a multi-concept store that catered to men, women and children that's been a mainstay of the Shadyside business district for decades.

Meyer explained, “With less places here to shop, fewer people are going to walk down here. Plus, rents are back up to pre-Covid prices with added inflation."

While like Meyer said how Covid has had such a significant impact on businesses, it’s heartening to see how beloved classics like Pamela’s endured through the pandemic and new businesses like Amazing Books & Records were able to move in and set up shop in record time. The community’s support for local businesses truly highlights how people came together to keep these establishments alive.

Despite these challenges, there is hope for new businesses to move in and revitalize Walnut Street. As rents stabilize and more people return to the area, opportunities for innovation and unique shops to establish themselves will arise, it could potentially bring in some new life to this beloved shopping district. Lululemon employee Dorian Anderson sure thinks so.

Anderson said that recently there has been a bit of economic and real estate boom here, with a lot of development being done in the East side and lots of businesses coming in around Shadyside. Anderson added “There has been a lot of change. It’s exciting to see what new development is added to Shadyside.”

Regardless of these challenges, there’s still an abundance of shopping to enjoy. Here are two more of my favorites to visit while enjoying this lovely summer weather.

## ACTIVITIES

Shadyside is also the home to many historical chapels and Victorian homes renowned for their stunning architecture. As you stroll through the neighborhood, you’ll discover many churches feature the use of sand stones in their structure, each with their unique variations and intricate details. The charming Victorian homes are scattered throughout Shadyside for you to observe! If you also get the chance, check out Roslyn Place, one of the last wooden streets remaining in all of Pennsylvania, filled with over 26,000 oak blocks - a must-see if you have an interest in its architecture and history.

Looking for activities beyond food and shopping? Shadyside has you covered with a variety of fun events and activities to mark on your calendar on your next visit!
