## Find Your Home in Local Neighborhoods

All first-year CMU undergraduate students live on campus, but many upperclassmen and graduate students discover their home away from home in nearby neighborhoods. From the tree-lined streets of [Shadyside](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/shadyside/) and the bustling eateries of [Squirrel Hill](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/squirrel-hill/) to the academic and cultural hub of [Oakland](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/oakland/), each area offers its own unique character and conveniences.

A major perk? Pittsburgh's housing affordability. [According to Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/pittsburgh-pa/), the average rent in the city is 15% lower than the national average, stretching your budget further.
