Mayor Murray was one of the handful of Pittsburgh Mayor’s to serve two nonconsecutive terms. During his first term the first waterworks, a reservoir on Grant's Hill, and new wharfs were built.

During his second, a plan to light city streets with gas was defeated by public outrage when Select Council members bought all the stock in in the firm the named to accomplish the work. When Council passed a law allowing dogs without collars to be shot on sight, Murray opposed the move and suggested that the number of dogs could be reduced more effectively by taxation.

![Samuel-Pettigrew.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/samuel-pettigrew.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1832-1836**

In 1834, the Gas Works wereestablished, and the first public school opened with five pupils. Pettigrew also asked Council to appoint a joint committee to hire a police force.

## The Honorable Jonas R. McClintock

![Jonas-R.-McClintock.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/jonas-r.-mcclintock.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1836-1839**

McClintock was the first Mayor to try and expand the role of the office toward that of a true executive.

A native Pittsburgher and physician who became a hero during the cholera epidemic, in 1834 he was elected to the Common Council and was its President the following year. A year later he became Pittsburgh’s Mayor. Although his relationship with Council was poor, he fought to create the first 18 member police force. During his time in office the city enlarged itself for the first time with the annexation of the Northern Liberties Borough.

## The Honorable William Little

![William-Little.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/william-little.jpg?w=300&h=300)

## The Honorable Alexander Hay

_No known likeness survives._

**Term: 1842 – 1845**

Hay became Mayor through the inability of Mayor Thomson to win the endorsement and a three-way race for the office. Hay won two more terms by narrow margins before coming in third place when he sought a fourth term. In his first year in office, he hired more police officers over Council’s opposition.

## The Honorable William J. Howard

![William-J.-Howard.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/william-j.-howard.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1845 – 1846**

A businessman, Howard won his single term of office by 29 votes in a four-candidate race. Success was attributed to his campaign theme to keep the Bible as a textbook in the schools.

## The Honorable William Kerr

_No known likeness survives._

**Term: 1846 – 1847**

A doctor, Kerr married a daughter of former Mayor Snowden and became Mayor eight months after the great fire. Kerr’s term was dedicated to rebuilding.

## The Honorable Gabriel Adams

_No known likeness survives._

A wholesale grocer, Adams suffered financial ruin that cost him his home and business. An easy winner for his first term when Mayor Kerr refused to seek another term, Adams faced serious challenges a year later. Adams ran on the platform that with the salary of Mayor he would be able to pay off his debts, while his opponents were rich men. He was elected by 96 votes. After leaving office, he became an Associate Judge of the Common Pleas Court in 1852.

## The Honorable John Herron

**Term: 1849 – 1850**

A hero in the Mexican War, Herron returned to Pittsburgh in time to capitalize on his popularity by being elected Mayor in a field of seven candidates. Other than an effort by his clergyman father to close down Sunday liquor sales, little happened during the Herron Administration and he did not seek a second term. Notably, Pittsburgh’s Herron Hill Junior High School, today the Pittsburgh Milliones School, was built on the land of his estate.

## The Honorable Joseph Barker

![Joseph-Barker.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/joseph-barker.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1850 – 1851**

An unordained preacher, Barker was appointed a street commissioner in 1839. Barker turned to preaching in the streets, an anti-Catholicism doctrine, that caused him to be arrested numerous times. When sentenced to a year in jail, Barker told the jury to “go to hell” and threatened the judge with hanging. Pittsburgh embraced Barker, electing him their Mayor. Through the effort of a mob, the judge who sentenced him was forced to administer the oath of office. Judge Benjamin Potham, then resigned and moved to Ohio. Barker’s term was marked by an ongoing fight with Council over the police that resulted in Council and the Mayor appointing separate forces that spent much of their time arresting each other.

Until he was run over by a train in 1862, Barker repeatedly sought reelection without success.

## The Honorable John B. Guthrie

![John-B.-Guthrie.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/john-b.-guthrie.jpg?w=300&h=300)

## The Honorable Ferdinand E. Volz

_No known likeness survives._

**Term: 1854 – 1856**

As Mayor, Volz succeeded in reducing the number of pigs allowed to run loose on City streets. His first term was also marked by a cholera epidemic that killed almost 500 citizens. The city however, kept the exact number secret in order to prevent a general panic. From May to December 1854 a severe drought parched the region, Volz was defeated for a third term.

## The Honorable William Bingham

![William-Bingham.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/william-bingham.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1856 – 1857**

An agent for canal and steamboat freight carriers, Bingham ran for Mayor of the Native American Party candidate in a five-candidate field. Bingham’s surprise at his victory was so great, his inaugural remarks were spent describing his unfamiliarity with his new duties.

## The Honorable Henry A. Weaver

![Henry-A.-Weaver.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/henry-a.-weaver.jpg?w=300&h=300)

A successful coal merchant, Weaver was an early supporter of the New Republican Party. A year after election to Pittsburgh’s Select Council, he was a delegate to the 1856 Republican Convention. While republicans didn’t fare well nationally in that election, they were a success in Pittsburgh and Weaver became the first of seventeen republican Mayors. During his first year in office, the first railroad bridge was built across the Allegheny River to bring the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroads into the city. Through the act of legislature, the Mayor’s term was extended to two years and Weaver became the only Mayor to serve both a one and two year term.

![Benair-C.-Sawyer.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/benair-c.-sawyer.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1862 – 1864**

A soap manufacturer, Benair Sawyer served on the Select and Common Councils while he made repeated efforts to win the Mayor’s Office. A republican, Sawyer was denied a second term after rumors of scandals in his office prevented him from winning.

**Term: 1864 – 1866**

Owner of a foundry, Lowry was an early member of the Republican Party. Because of the corruption of the last administration, Lowry ran under an independent banner of Union City. He easily won and dedicated his term to aiding wounded soldiers and those recruits passing through the city on their way to the battlefields.

Lowry went on to be elected to Allegheny County Coroner.

## The Honorable William C. McCarthy

![William-C.-McCarthy.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/william-c.-mccarthy.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1866-1868 and 1875 – 1878**

“Roaring Bill” McCarthy, a pressman, and volunteer firefighter, was a prominent republican who defeated Lowry for the nomination. During his first term, Pittsburgh annexed numerous boroughs, including Lawrenceville and Oakland.

**Term: 1868 – 1869 and 1872 – 1875**

A democrat, James Blackmore defeated J. W. Riddle for Mayor. Not content to let Blackmore serve out his two-year term, the State Republicans passed a law that changed the office to a three-year term and thus removed Blackmore from office.

**Term: 1878 – 1881**

Liddell served on the Common and Select Councils before winning the office of the Mayor as a democrat. Although, his victory was the result of a public revolt against the excess of the Magee-Flinn Ring.

Streets were first lit with electricity and telephone service began.

## The Honorable Robert W. Lyon

## The Honorable William McCallin

Another product of the Magee-Flinn ring, McCallin was elected Allegheny County Sheriff in 1881. In his first year as Mayor, the first electric street car was put in service, and in 1869 Mary Schenley donated the land that would become Schenley Park, Schenley Farms, and Schenley High School. The power of a Mayor increased in the Act of 1887. Contracts were controlled by a Board made up of the Mayor and three department heads. Control over the police through the Mayor’s new power to appoint police was solidified.

## The Honorable Henry I. Gourley

![Henry-I.-Gourley.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/henry-i.-gourley.jpg?w=300&h=300)

A Civil War gunboat veteran, McKenna returned to Pittsburgh to become an officer of Iron Moulder’s Union and Captain in the still politically powerful volunteer fire company. After an unsuccessful attempt at the Mayor’s Office in 1887 he was in term named Police Magistrate.

## The Honorable Henry P. Ford

![Henry-P.-Ford.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/henry-p.-ford.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1896 – 1899**

A bookkeeper who engaged in a variety of lumber and manufacturing businesses, Ford was first elected to the Select Council in 1881.

## The Honorable William J. Diehl

![William-J.-Diehl.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/william-j.-diehl.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1899 – 1901**

A Magee-Flinn member, Diehl served as a Pittsburgh School Board Member until elected to Select Council 1898. A year later the ring had him elected Mayor, his allegiance to the ring cost him his political career.

His enemies retaliated by helping to maneuvering a Pittsburgh Charter Bill through the State General Assembly that eliminated the Office of the Mayor – and Mayor Diehl – with it. To replace it with a nearly identical office known as “Recorder”. Diehl, cheated out of his job moved to Arkansas.

## The Honorable Adam M. Brown

![Adam-M.-Brown.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/adam-m.-brown.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1901**

An attorney, he was a close friend of Senator Quay - the orchastrater of his predecessors removal from office. The relationship saw him appointed to the new Office of Recorder by Governor William Stone. He immediately dismissed many ring officeholders. Unfortunately, Flinn, now running the ring alone after the death of his coconspirator Magee, made peace with the Governor and Senator. With that peace the turned on Recorder (Mayor) Brown and he was dismissed by Governor Stone after only seven months in office.

## The Honorable Joseph O. Brown

![Joseph-O.-Brown.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/joseph-o.-brown.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1901 – 1903**

Public Safety Director since 1887, Brown was nearly fired for his refusal to close the vice centers at the order of former Mayor Gourley. Perhaps because of the confusion of names, Governor Stone appointed Brown to replace A. M. Brown. Vice and corruption continued without opposition from the city’s Chief Executive, the voters passed on Brown for reelection and he proceeded to die in office.

## The Honorable William B. Hays

![William-B.-Hays.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/william-b.-hays.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1903 – 1906**

A failed meatpacker, Hays became a part of the ring and held a variety of posts, including Deputy Sheriff, member of the Board of Health, and Chief City Assessor. When the Bigelow brothers went over to the Quay faction, Hays went with them. Hays the bolted from the Bigelow-Quay group and joined the Citizens Reform Party and finally the Democratic Party. He beat the Quay candidate for Recorder and assumed the office upon the death of Recorder Brown. By the time his term began, Legislators tried to end the battle by renaming the office, Mayor. During his term the neighborhoods of Esplen and Elliott were annexed.

## The Honorable George W. Guthrie

![George-W.-Guthrie.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/george-w.-guthrie.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1906 – 1909**

The grandson and son of Mayors, George Wilkins Guthrie became active in reform politics in the 1880’s and helped organize the Citizens League for Reform in 1895. Guthrie was defeated in his first attempt at the Mayor’s Office in 1896. Only after the ring’s republican internal fights and open corruption cost the party support, did Guthrie a democrat win. As Mayor, Guthrie exposed the general corruption of the City government that led to the conviction of many Councilmembers. This led to the elimination of the old system and the creation of a 9-member at large Council and a court appointed School Board. The City adopted a Civil Service system and continued to annex such communities Sheridan, and the population doubling City of Allegheny, the present-day North Side.

After his term President Wilson named him the American Ambassador to Japan.

## The Honorable William A. Magee

![William-A.-Magee.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/william-a.-magee.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1909 – 1914 and 1922 – 1926**

William Addison Magee transcended the eras of the ring reform and the Mellon Brothers domination of republican politics. A nephew of Christopher L. Magee, who’s family estate “Maples” became Magee-Women's Hospital, he was an Assistant District Attorney and member of Select Council. Elected in 1909, Magee soon benefited from change in state law that extended the Mayor’s term to the current four years.

During his term he oversaw the removal of the Grant Street hump, and the construction of the Bloomfield, Manchester, Larimer Avenue, and Murray Avenue bridges. Eight years after his first term he won a second nonconsecutive. Magee was persuaded not to seek a third term, but betrayed the democrats by seeking the republican nomination in 1937.

## The Honorable Joseph G. Armstrong

![Joseph-G.-Armstrong.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/joseph-g.-armstrong.jpg?w=300&h=300)

**Term: 1914 – 1918**

A glassblower, Armstrong was an early labor leader and member of the Common and Select Councils from 1896 – 1905. When many of his colleagues were indicted for accepting bribes, he resigned from Council and successfully ran for County Coroner. He resigned that position to become Mayor Magee’s Director of Public Works. Mayor Magee fired Armstrong when he discovered his Director was planning to run for Mayor. Yet with the support of the old boss, William Flinn he won the election. He became known as “Joe the Builder” for his extensive public works projects such as the Armstrong Tunnels, Mount Washington (McArdle) Roadway, and the construction of our iconic City-County Building.

## The Honorable Edward V. Babcock

![Edward-V.-Babcock.jpg](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/mayor/images/mayors-of-pittsburgh/edward-v.-babcock.jpg?w=300&h=300)

The Democratic Party had been out of office for so long, the only candidate party leader David Lawrence could field against Herron was perennial candidate William McNair. An attorney, McNair began his political career in 1911 by running simultaneously for District Attorney and judge.

McNair’s term was full of questionable decisions. He appointed his chauffeur Director of Public Safety and put his desk in the lobby of the City-County Building. He refused to spend funds allocated by Council for shoes so that children could go to school and rejected Pittsburgh’s participation in federal relief efforts.

His demise would come by his own actions. He decided to default on City debt, a chorus of opposition caused him to choose to resign from office in protest. Failing to rally the public with this odd ploy, he tried to resign his resignation, but it was too late.
