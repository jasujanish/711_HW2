_“Pittsburgh’s oldest Log House”_

## About the Neill Log House

The Neill Log House, located in Schenley Park, is the City of Pittsburgh’s oldest existing log residence. Built in 1795, it is one of only five residential structures in Pittsburgh remaining from the 18th century.

The log house was built by Robert Neill, a Revolutionary War veteran who made his living as a wagoner, after he laid claim to the original 262-acre tract of land that lies within Schenley Park. This signified a new era in Pittsburgh’s history, when settlers began building permanent residences instead of temporary log cabins. The log house’s detailed features, such as hewed logs, a wooden floor, and the addition of a loft, point to an abundance of time and attention when constructing the home.

Additionally, the Neill Log House is featured as a stop on the national Lewis & Clark Trail Experience, as research suggests that Meriwether Lewis stopped to water his horse at a spring now replaced by the Catahecassa Fountain, in 1803.

**Address:** 5229 East Circuit Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15217

## Friends of Neill Log House

In October 2021, the Squirrel Hill Historical Society and the Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition joined together to form Friends of Neill Log House, Inc. with the mission to restore and reopen the house for educational purposes.

After a historically accurate restoration, and the installation of steps, fencing, railings, and more, the grand opening took place in November 2024.

In partnership with Friends of Neill Log House, the Pittsburgh Park Rangers have since begun hosting tours, open hours, and recreational events to help share Schenley Park’s rich history with guests
