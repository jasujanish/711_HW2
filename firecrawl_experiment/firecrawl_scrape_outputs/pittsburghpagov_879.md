# Pittsburgh Paving Program

The City of Pittsburghâ€™s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is excited to announce the 2023 Paving Season. Street resurfacing work is scheduled all over the City, so please see the [resurfacing schedule](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Resident-Services/Road-Maintenance/Paving-Schedule) webpage to find upcoming work in your neighborhood.

## How is the yearly paving list created?

**Criteria for Street Selection**

The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) works with community groups, council members, and 311 to identify potential issues in the right-of-way regarding street surface conditions. DOMI's staff and engineers create a yearly list based of off the following criteria:

- **Street Overall Condition Index (OCI)** \- Every street in Pittsburgh has an OCI score based upon the physical condition. Once the condition of the street deteriorates past a certain threshold it is given additional priority on the yearly paving list.
- **Street Use** \- Streets are broken into three categories: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary. Primary roads receive the most use, which results in their OCI score dropping more quickly than Secondary or Tertiary.
- **Equity** \- We apply this metric to the paving list to ensure that tax dollars are applied in a fair and impartial way so that streets in neighborhoods with a higher need receive an increase in their OCI score.

## How do I report a street or road related issue?
