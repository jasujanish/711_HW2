## Introduction

Councilman Bobby Wilson proudly represents Pittsburgh’s District 1, which includes the Northside, the Strip District, and parts of Downtown. Elected in 2020, he has focused on strengthening neighborhoods through strategic investments in parks, sidewalk infrastructure, and traffic calming measures. He led efforts to expand the Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance (LERTA) program to incentivize development in Downtown, and championed legislation to support more flexible attached housing options throughout the city.

As Chair of the Land Use and Economic Development Committee, Councilman Wilson has advanced key initiatives such as expanding permitted uses in zoning to support the growth of childcare facilities, safeguarding reproductive rights through local legislation, and authoring a bill to allow supervised youth camping programs in public parks. He also serves as a Director on the Board of the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Chairman on the Board of the Pittsburgh Land Bank.

In his role as President Pro Tempore, Councilman Wilson serves in City Council leadership, helping guide legislative priorities and support collaborative governance.
