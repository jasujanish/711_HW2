## The GEC Supports AAPI Communities

March 23, 2021

Hate crimes against Asians in the US rose in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2020 and early 2021.

One week ago, several Asian American women were among those killed in Atlanta and the immediate aftermath repeated histories of racial stereotyping.

The Gender Equity Commission exists to support a more equitable city for all residents and to help end discrimination against women, girls, and gender-diverse people.

Our work is, and will continue to be, intersectional in nature, because we know this violence will not end unless we call out the root causes of white supremacy, patriarchy, and those systems and sentiments that support them.

## Educating Ourselves About Gender

**[Gender and Sex 101: Gender Equity in the Classroom and Beyond(PDF, 3MB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/bac/documents/eorc/9312_sexgender101_digital_2019.pdf)**

A 'gender and sex 101' resource created by Jessie Ramey, the Director of Chatham's Women's Institute and a Gender Equity Commissioner (April 2020).

**[Gender and Sexuality: Binary or Fluid?](https://citiesforcedaw.org/)**

While one might assume that that there are "opposite" genders or sexes, many people self-identify as trans or gender non-conforming. And TSER (Trans Student Education Resources)-- a national organization led entirely by trans youth-- points out the distinctions between gender identity, gender presentation/expression, sex, and attraction. They advocate for recognition that people might identify as, express themselves as, and be attracted to, many genders. Learn more on the [TSER website.](https://www.transstudent.org/)
