# Letters of Support Forms

All requests for a letter of support from the Office of the Mayor are due by the 10th day of every month. Applications are reviewed by the Mayor and staff using an evaluation rubric on a monthly basis. If necessary, a follow up meeting may be scheduled to further discuss the project. Please allow the appropriate amount of time for approval of a letter of support in your project planning timeline.
