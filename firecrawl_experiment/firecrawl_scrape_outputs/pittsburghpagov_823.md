We seek to with Pittsburgh's Disability Community and its allies to guide policymaking and the creation of a roadmap to a more inclusive Pittsburgh.

The City of Pittsburgh is developing an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Transition Plan to improve accessibility for people with disabilities.

This plan serves as a detailed guide to identify and address barriers in public spaces like sidewalks, parks, and buildings, as well as city programs, services, and websites that may be hard to access. By outlining actions to remove these barriers, the plan ensures compliance with the ADA and strives to make public spaces, services, and digital platforms more inclusive for everyone. It also sets priorities, timelines, and budgets to make these improvements.

Your input is a key part of this plan. Feedback from people with disabilities, their families, caregivers, and others with accessibility knowledge is vital to guide the City’s efforts. The survey asks about accessibility to permits, fees, programs, and public meetings. Responses will be public, but personal details will remain confidential.

Contact [ADA@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:ada@pittsburghpa.gov) to request the survey in another language.
