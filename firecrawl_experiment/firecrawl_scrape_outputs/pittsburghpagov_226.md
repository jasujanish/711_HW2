### Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice

In accordance with the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, each entitlement community such as Pittsburgh must “affirmatively further fair housing.” To demonstrate that an entitlement community is “affirmatively furthering fair housing,” it must prepare an Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice which identifies any impediments to fair housing choice and what steps it will take to affirmatively further fair housing. The City of Pittsburgh performs this analysis and prepares an Assessment of Fair Housing every five years.

### HOME-ARP

Congress appropriated $5 billion in funds under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021. These funds are to be used to assist the homeless and those persons and families who are at risk of becoming homeless. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is administering this program and the City of Pittsburgh was allocated $8,342,028 in HOME-ARP funds. The City of Pittsburgh, Office of Management and Budget, Community Development Division is the lead entity and the administrator for the HOME-ARP funds. In addition, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA), through a cooperative agreement between the two (2) agencies will assist the City with implementing components of the HOME-ARP Allocation Plan. The URA of Pittsburgh is the lead entity and administrator for the HOME funds. The City of Pittsburgh prepared this HOME-ARP Allocation Plan to address its local needs and to establish priorities for the use of HOME-ARP funds.
