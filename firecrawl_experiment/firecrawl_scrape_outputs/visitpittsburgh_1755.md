Barrel & Flow

As the first brew fest dedicated to Black brewers, drinkers and artists, [Barrel & Flow Fest](http://www.barrelandflow.com/) has put Pittsburgh on the Black brew map, and has helped position the city as one of the leaders in brewery diversity and inclusion.

## Barrel & Flow Fest

What's with the name? Well, the [Barrel](http://www.barrelandflow.com/barrel) refers to the brews and [Flow](http://www.barrelandflow.com/flow) references the performing artists and speakers. Together, Barrel & Flow represents what attendees can expect at the event: one-of-a-kind brews fresh from the barrel accompanied by live art, food vendors and entertainment all day.

This year, festivities will take place at [The Stacks at 3 Crossings](http://3crossingspgh.com/offices/the-stacks/) in the [Strip District](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/strip-district/), where festival goers can enjoy exclusive craft brew collaborations, a uniquely curated collection of vendors, live music and entertainment, networking opportunities and plenty of fun. The festival is open from noon-9 p.m. Saturday for general admission and will feature more than 150 vendors.
