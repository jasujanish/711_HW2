# Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)

The Community Development Block Grant program, abbreviated to CDBG, is funding from the Federal Government that goes to local governments like the City of Pittsburgh. Congress allocates CDBG funds from the federal budget, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) manages the program nationally. CDBG funds must be used to benefit people with low to moderate incomes.

The Community Development Division is responsible for the administration of the CDBG program for the City of Pittsburgh. Serving as a catalyst for development in the City's neighborhoods, this program distributes grants for a wide range of projects which address the housing, economic, and human service needs of low and moderate income residents and neighborhoods. The City uses CDBG funds for general public improvement projects such as sidewalk repairs and demolishing vacant buildings. Funds are also awarded to local nonprofit organizations as [Public Service Grants](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/City-Government/Finance-Budget/Management-Budget/Community-Development/Public-Service-Grant) or [Neighborhood Economic Development Grants](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/City-Government/Finance-Budget/Management-Budget/Community-Development/Neighborhood-Economic-Development-NED).

HUD has a library of resources available on their [Explore CDBG page](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-ta-products/#all-products), designed to help community develpment professionals leverage grant funds effectively. For a deeper dive in the regulations that the City of Pittsburgh must follow you can view HUD's [CDBG Entitlement Program Eligibility Requirements](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-entitlement/cdbg-entitlement-program-eligibility-requirements/).
