# Homewood Community Plan

## The Neighborhood

In the early 20th century, changing industry and increasing growth beyond downtown led to the development of the Homewood community. The increased population needed transportation and a system of streetcar lines was constructed to connect the neighborhood to downtown. During the 1950s, Homewood experienced residential growth with displaced residents from the Lower Hill and Homewood to become one of Pittsburgh's largest African-American neighborhoods.

Homewood consists of three neighborhoods – Homewood North, Homewood West, and Homewood South – with a combined population of 6,442, which is 94% African-American, as of the 2010 census. Homewood is predominantly residential with commercial activities concentrated on Frankstown Road and Homewood Avenue corridors. Of the 5,194 parcels that make up Homewood, 49.6% are vacant, according to a 2014 Operation Better Block survey. This plan will aim to provide strategies that will increase housing, development, mobility, and infrastructure in an equitable way.

Homewood has a valuable ecosystem of dedicated community organizations and leaders who have worked to develop plans for parts of the neighborhood. The residents, stakeholders, and institutions of Homewood have worked to rebuild and envision a Homewood of the future. This planning process built off that foundation and establishes a common vision and direction for the Homewood community.

## The Vision for the Future of Homewood

_Homewood will be an African-American cultural destination where people choose to live, work, worship, and visit. It will be safe, green, healthy, and innovative. It will have quality schools. It will be a place that protects long-term and low-income residents and equips them to be engaged and informed._
