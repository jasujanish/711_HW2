# Trading in my “Y’all” for “Yinz”

Hello fellow students and families!

Welcome to Pittsburgh! Whether you’re a native to the city or traveled to the ‘Burgh from 1,500 miles away (like me), rest assured you are in the right place for college. My name is Amber Frantz, and this is my journey from the Lone Star State to the City of Bridges––a place I am proud to call my second home.

## My Story

When I tell people I’m from Texas, I often receive a puzzling look followed by the pressing question: “Why did you want to come to Pittsburgh?” It’s a response I encounter time and time again, giving me ample opportunity to reflect––why did I come to Pittsburgh?

Despite being born just outside of Philly, I was mostly raised in the small town of Boerne, Texas, located just 31 miles north of downtown San Antonio. Nestled in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, Boerne’s charm and family-oriented community made for an ideal place to grow up. But with a desire for change and need to escape the Texas heat, I had my sights set on leaving.

The summer before my senior year of high school, I stumbled upon the University of Pittsburgh when making my college list. I knew little about the city apart from its history as an industrial hub, but I was drawn to Pitt because of its reputation for academic excellence. Fast forward three years––now entering my junior year at Pitt, I have come to love and adore my new home.

## The Perfect City for Young Adults

Apart from educational and career opportunities, Pittsburgh is an ideal city for young adults with a newfound sense of independence. When describing city life in Pittsburgh, one word comes to mind: manageable. From its easy access [public transportation](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/plan-your-trip/transportation/public-transportation/) to its walkable residential neighborhoods, Pittsburgh allows you to reap the benefits of living in a city without while still maintaining a small-town friendliness.

As a Pitt student, I spend the majority of my time in Pittsburgh’s [Oakland](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/oakland/) neighborhood. With plenty to offer from places to eat and outdoor spaces to explore, Oakland has it all. Perhaps one of the Oakland’s biggest selling points is how close it is to surrounding [neighborhoods](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/). Squirrel Hill, [Shadyside](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/saturdays-in-shadyside/), South Side, and the [Strip District](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/the-strip-district-a-local-pittsburgh-favorite/) are just four of Pittsburgh’s 90 neighborhoods––each distinct from the other, offering their own sense of charm and character.

## The Burgh is a Culinary Delight

Hailing from Texas––the land of BBQ and authentic Tex-Mex cuisine––I was eager to explore the Pittsburgh [food scene.](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/restaurants-culinary/) Home to Heinz Ketchup and famous for its [pierogies](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/unique-pittsburgh-pierogi-joints/), Pittsburgh is no stranger to the culinary industry. But much to my surprise, the range of Pittsburgh’s cuisine spans much farther than the [homey staple](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/foods-you-can-only-get-in-pittsburgh/) s of Pamela’s Diner and the iconic Primanti Bros. sandwich.

Pittsburgh’s [diverse food scene](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/foodie-itinerary/) offers a wide variety of tastes to satisfy any palate. A foodie at heart, I have crossed continents with my taste buds despite never actually leaving the city. While I am still in search for the best smoked brisket and street tacos that rival those in the Lone Star State, Pittsburgh certainly lives up to its reputation as a food city.

## An Urban Paradise Rain or Shine

Apart from its food scene, there is one other standout quality of Pittsburgh that truly surprised me: the weather. To some, the overcast, rainy conditions of the city may pose challenges and drawbacks. But to me, Pittsburgh’s climate offered respite from the blazing Texas sun.

My move from the South to the North not only offered me a faster paced lifestyle but introduced the concept of real seasons, something I lacked in Texas. Except for “the great Texas freeze” of 2021, I had never experienced a true winter that I could remember. That being said, my first [fall](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/fall-in-love-with-pittsburgh-fall-foliage/) and [winter](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/visitors-guide-to-winter-in-pittsburgh/) season in Pittsburgh is one I will never forget.

When the weather proves unfavorable, there are a multitude of [indoor activities](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pittsburgh-winter-indoor-fun/) to explore in Pittsburgh. From [Carnegie Museum of Natural History](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/carnegie-museum-of-art-and-natural-history/) and [Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/phipps-conservatory-and-botanical-gardens/) to simply cozying up in a local [coffee shop](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/cozy-coffee-shops-in-pittsburgh/) with a good [book](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pittsburgh-independent-bookstores/), there is always something to do in Pittsburgh regardless of the weather. But when the sun does grace the city with its presence, be sure to take advantage of all the outdoor spaces Pittsburgh has, including Schenley and Frick Park.

Looking back on my past two years in Pittsburgh, I am grateful to my 18-year-old self for taking a risk, choosing Pitt as my college, and moving across the country. Texas will always be my home, but I am fortunate to call Pittsburgh my home now as well––and I hope you will too.
