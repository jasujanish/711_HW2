# Appeals

If a request for information is denied or deemed denied by the City, the requester may appeal the decision to the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records:

Executive Director

Office of Open Records

Commonwealth Keystone Building

400 North Street, 4th Floor

Harrisburg, PA 17120

The appeal must be made within fifteen business days of the City's denial or deemed denial, and must set forth the grounds on which the requester believes that the record is a public record, and the grounds for the denial by the City.

The Pennsylvania Office of Open Records will assign an appeals officer to the case, and the appeals officer will issue a decision within thirty days of the receipt of the appeal. The decision of the appeals officer may be appealed to the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas.
