**Pittsburgh, PA** (June 6, 2023) — Pittsburgh City Councilman Bobby Wilson (District 1) introduced [legislation](https://pittsburgh.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6249990&GUID=EA926526-BDA3-420A-8047-9BCC9CE7F624&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=POGOH&FullText=1) at today’s Regular Meeting of Pittsburgh City Council authorizing the Office of Mayor Ed Gainey and the City’s Department of Human Resources and Civil Service to enter into an agreement with POGOH to provide all City of Pittsburgh employees with annual bicycle share memberships. These memberships will include unlimited 30-minute rides, and City employees will be able to utilize a POGOH network of 60 station locations boasting 240 traditional pedal bicycles and 360 electric-assist bicycles.

“At POGOH, we're committed to encouraging short bike trips that are convenient, joyful, and affordable for Pittsburgh residents and visitors,” said David White, Executive Director of POGOH. “We've worked closely with the City of Pittsburgh to bring electric-assist bicycles to our city; City employees have been the real champions and thought leaders in implementing new speed humps, bike lanes, bicycle neighborways, and new POGOH stations that have all made our city better and safer for bicycles. I am thrilled that, by formalizing this corporate membership, all City employees will now have access to 30-minute POGOH rides.”

The transportation sector, according to the United States Department of Transportation, is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

“It's great to see the City of Pittsburgh support their employees' transportation needs and model good policy for other local employers," said Scott Bricker, BikePGH Executive Director. "Everyone benefits when more people are biking and there are fewer cars on the road.”

Here in the City of Pittsburgh, to make meaningful progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions locally, and to reduce congestion on our roads, enhance mobility justice, and improve public health, Councilman Wilson introduced this legislation seeking to launch this partnership with POGOH to provide this benefit to thousands of City employees.

“Partnering with POGOH will send a clear signal that the City of Pittsburgh is committed to reducing car trips by offering all our employees the option of taking free short POGOH trips. This partnership will also promote the health and wellness of our employees while fostering a cleaner and greener work environment here at the City,” said Councilman Wilson.
