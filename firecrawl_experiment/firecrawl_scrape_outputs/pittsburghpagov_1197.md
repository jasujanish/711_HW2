The City of Pittsburgh announces this year’s upcoming trick-or-treat hours for Halloween.  All participating neighborhoods can host trick-or-treating from 5:30pm to 7:30 pm on Friday, October 31st.

We want everyone to be able to safely enjoy this holiday, so we suggest that parents and guardians check all candy before allowing children to indulge.  It’s also recommended that trick-or-treaters' wear costumes that are bright, or that they carry a light to ensure they are visible to everyone around them.

Motorists are asked to be especially vigilant on Halloween night, avoid speeding, and be on the lookout for trick-or-treaters.

Let’s have a fun and safe Halloween!
