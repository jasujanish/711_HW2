# Bridge Asset Management Program

In the aftermath of the unexpected collapse of the Fern Hollow bridge in January 2022, Mayor Gainey assembled a team of experts and charged them with producing a comprehensive understanding of the state of our bridges, a list of immediate actions needed to address the most serious deficiencies, and a plan for ensuring every bridge is in a state of good repair. This team of City employees hired and oversaw the work of WSP, who brought together five engineering firms with extensive experience in infrastructure inspection, construction and maintenance as well as comprehensive asset management. The consultant team reviewed all of the bridge reports, did on-site inspections, reviewed photos, had access to advanced drone technologies and former City of Pittsburgh engineers whose institutional knowledge proved invaluable.
