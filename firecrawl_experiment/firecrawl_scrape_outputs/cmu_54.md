# Call for Honorary Degree Nominations

July 08, 2024

Dear Members of the CMU Community:

I am writing to invite and encourage you to nominate candidates to be considered for an honorary degree from Carnegie Mellon University.

The CMU honorary degree is one of the highest distinctions the university bestows on an individual. Recipients serve as an inspiration to the Carnegie Mellon community, especially to members of the graduating class. Recognizing them reinforces the significant scope of the university and enhances the commencement ceremony by highlighting the importance of the university in the world. **Learn more about the honorary degree** [**nomination process and past recipients**](https://www.cmu.edu/honorary-degrees/index.html) **.**

We seek to honor a diverse cohort of individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to their professions, to our nation, or to the world, and whose life and work are broadly connected to the highest aims and aspirations of this university.

Nominees must be distinguished individuals who meet at least one of the following criteria:

- Achieved preeminent levels of distinction in their fields and demonstrated extraordinary achievements, with a preference for those with a clear affiliation or connection to CMU;
- Established record of exemplary service to the world, to our nation, to our region, or to society; or
- Displayed an extraordinary commitment of service to Carnegie Mellon University, with a demonstrable positive impact on the university and its community.

**Please** [**submit nominations**](https://www.cmu.edu/honorary-degrees/nominations/nomination-form.html) **no later than September 6, 2024.** If you have any questions, please contact [Kate Lippert](mailto:klippert@andrew.cmu.edu), director of the Board of Trustees office. As was done last year, the timeline for this process has been moved earlier in the fiscal year in the interest of identifying and securing an exceptional list of outstanding candidates in a timely manner.

Thank you for your nominations, which will help identify another distinguished group of CMU honorary degree recipients.

Warm Regards,

Farnam Jahanian

President

Henry L. Hillman Presidentâ€™s Chair
