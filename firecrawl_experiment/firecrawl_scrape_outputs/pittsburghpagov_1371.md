# Community Outreach & Education

To help inform and care for City of Pittsburgh residents, Pittsburgh EMS has created the COPE program â€“ Community Outreach Program and Education.

Through COPE paramedics provide:

- Health Screenings
- CPR/AED Training
- "Show and Tell" events at local gatherings, schools and Scout camps

If you group is interested in making a request for CPR/AED or an appearance by our personnel please contact us at [COPE Requests](mailto:Jennifer.Grubb@pittsburghpa.gov).
