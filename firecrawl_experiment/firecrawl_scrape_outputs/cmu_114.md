# Building the Boom

## Carnegie Mellon University's Growing Impact on the Local, Regional and State Economies

These are exciting times for CMU and the Pittsburgh region. Since 2016, the university’s annual economic impact across Pennsylvania has surged by nearly $600 million — a 23% increase in just four years.

Key factors in this growth include an 11% increase in research enterprise and a dynamic set of new capital investments such as TCS Hall, ANSYS Hall and Tepper Quad.

At CMU, real-world outcomes drive everything we do. Our faculty, students, staff and alumni collaborate with industry and community leaders to create change, inspiring world-class innovation and entrepreneurship. Our breakthrough research and education in technologies like AI and robotics are attracting global corporations and creating new opportunities in every sector of the economy, from manufacturing to health care.

Together, we’re working smarter. Transforming businesses, neighborhoods and lives. Together, we’re forging a better tomorrow.

## Building Growth in Our Communities

CMU is working to engineer groundbreaking solutions for global challenges while also developing partnerships that engage the community and drive economic growth. You can see these efforts from our National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC) facility in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood to the Hazelwood Green ecosystem taking shape in the Greater Hazelwood neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
