# Development Review Process Guides

If you are planning on building something in the City of Pittsburgh, you may need to work with the Department of City Planning Zoning & Development Review Division. To make the process easier, we have put together several easy to use guides that can help to get your project moving. Below are links for the common review processes within the Department of City Planning.

**Please note:** We are updating the Process Guides to transition and coordinate with [OneStopPGH](https://pittsburghpa.gov/onestoppgh/overview/). They will be uploaded as soon as we have them updated.
