| NOVEMBER 19 CITY OF PITTSBURGH TREE LIGHTING, ENTERTAINMENT & GINGERBREAD DISPLAY LAUNCH SET FOR LIGHT UP NIGHT | On Saturday, Nov. 19, the celebration of Pittsburgh’s holiday season will launch with the lighting of the City of Pittsburgh's Christmas tree on the Portico of the City-County Building, four hours of musical entertainment on Grant Street and the unveiling of the 20th annual Gingerbread House Display and Competition in the building's grand lobby.

The 2022 festivities are presented by the City of Pittsburgh Office of Special Events in partnership with Audacy Pittsburgh stations KDKA Radio, 100.7 Star, Y108, WAMO 107.3 and 93.7 The Fan. Visit [www.pittsburghps.gov/events](https://pittsburghpa.gov/events/index.html) for details.

**NOVEMBER 19 TREE LIGHTING CEREMONY & ENTERTAINMENT ON GRANT STREET STAGE**

The City of Pittsburgh's celebration of the 2022 holiday season kicks off with the lighting of a magnificent decorated 40-foot evergreen on the Portico of the City-County Building on Saturday, Nov. 19, as part of Highmark Light Up Night festivities. The four-hour celebration on the Portico and along Grant Street will include musical entertainment, fireworks, a light show, food trucks and the lighting of the City's official Christmas tree, the only live holiday tree in Downtown Pittsburgh.

The tree lighting carries on a treasured tradition for the 107th year. Pittsburgh's official Christmas Tree was first erected at the construction site of the City-County Building in 1915. For more than a century, a beautiful live evergreen (the only live holiday tree Downtown) has graced the front steps of our seat of government. The 40-foot Blue Spruce will be decorated with hundreds of larger than life ornaments, including Pittsburgh’s Coat of Arms designed by Wendell August Forge and 90 distinct ornaments, each bearing the name of Pittsburgh's beloved neighborhoods.

For tree lighting details, visit [www.pittsburghpa.gov/events/tree](https://pittsburghpa.gov/events/tree).
