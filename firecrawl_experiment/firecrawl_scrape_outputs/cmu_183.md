## Frequently Asked Questions About Interdisciplinary Studies

### What Are the Advantages of an Interdisciplinary Degree Program?

By integrating multiple areas of study into your undergraduate or graduate program, you gain creative, technical and practical skills that position you to drive innovation across disciplines in unique ways. Benefits to interdisciplinary studies include:

- Pursuing multiple interests by choosing areas that interest you most
- Accessing diverse expert insights and methodologies across CMU disciplines
- Following your intellectual curiosity to new or more efficient solutions
- Learning to communicate and collaborate with people with different academic backgrounds
- Building integrative problem-solving abilities prized by employers

### How Do Requirements for CMU’s Interdisciplinary Programs Differ From More Traditional Programs?

You can complete most CMU interdisciplinary programs within the same timeframe as traditional undergraduate or graduate programs. The key difference lies in the flexibility to customize your academic path. Choose courses from multiple departments or colleges as you fulfill your degree requirements.

Undergraduate students: If you are adding a double major or an additional major to create an interdisciplinary experience, be sure to talk to an academic advisor. Generally, it is possible to fulfill the requirements of both majors in four years by taking the course requirements of the second major in the elective spaces allowed by the first major.

### What Are the Kinds of Interdisciplinary Studies Available to Students at Carnegie Mellon?

For **undergraduate students**, we offer interdisciplinary majors, additional majors and minors. In addition, you can pursue many of our programs as a double major or additional major alongside your primary area of study. You can create a truly individualized path that matches your interests and goals.

For **graduate students**, we provide interdisciplinary master’s degrees and Ph.D. programs.

Consult our [academic advisors](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/advising/find-an-advisor.html) to explore the possibilities or design a customized degree plan. They can guide you in combining fields to craft an education tailored to your unique goals.
