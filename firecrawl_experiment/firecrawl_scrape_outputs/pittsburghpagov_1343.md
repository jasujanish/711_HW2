# Report Suspicious Activity

**Call 9-1-1 to report anything that you are actively witnessing or that may be an immediate threat**.

However, if nobody is in danger and yet you feel that government and law enforcement entities should be made aware of suspicious activity, please feel free to fill out a [Suspicious Activity Report(PDF, 29KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/public-safety/documents/3662_sar_4.pdf).

You may also submit a general written email with a description of the suspicious activity. Public Safety officials will require as much information and details about what you saw as possible. Please send your suspicious activity report to [suspicious@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:suspicious@pittsburghpa.gov) . Alternatively, if you would like to discuss any previous activity that seems suspicious in nature, please call the Pittsburgh Police Intelligence Unit at 412-323-7844.

**Remember** – when witnessing something active, always call 9-1-1 immediately!
