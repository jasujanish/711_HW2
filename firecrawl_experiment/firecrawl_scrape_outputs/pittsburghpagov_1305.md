# Guidelines

**Please keep these basic requirements in mind before applying:**

- Love Your Block is a City of Pittsburgh program with a maximum award of $2,500.
- Funding is provided through reimbursement after project implementation.
- Funding must be awarded through a nonprofit. If your organization is not a nonprofit, you can ask one to be your sponsor. Nonprofits are welcome to sponsor multiple projects.
- Projects must benefit the public.
- Projects on private property must have the written permission of the owner.
- All projects are subject to City of Pittsburgh Zoning and Permit guidelines.
- Project-related events must follow COVID-19 guidelines that are in place at the time of the events.

**In planning for strong and successful projects, consider the following priorities:**

1. **Build strong partnerships**
   - Partnering with other organizations, nonprofits, or groups to complete this project.
   - Recruit volunteers from neighborhood groups or organizations.
   - Ask local businesses to lend a hand or donate food or materials.
2. **Leverage donations**
   - Ask residents or local businesses to donate plants, compost material, or food for your volunteer event day.
3. **Make sure it’s feasible**
   - We love creative ideas, but don’t bite off more than you can chew! If you have a huge idea, make Love Your Block a first step in the right direction and secure some other partners that can assist with your plans.
4. **Engage neighbors**
   - While your volunteers can come from anywhere, we’ve found that the most impactful projects utilize volunteers within proximity to the project. People like to be a part of what’s happening next door and are more likely to maintain and sustain the project afterward if they helped plan and implement it.
