# Pittsburgh: A Sustainable Travel Destination

Wrapped in rivers, intertwined with trails and packed with parks, Pittsburgh is not only green in a sense of scenery. From the point that visitors land at Pittsburgh International Airport to various attractions, restaurants, shops and more, the region’s commitment to the environment is profound.

While Pittsburgh was once the poster child of industrial pollution, the successful urban environmental transformation over the last half-century has become a case study in [**sustainability**](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/things-to-do/arts-culture/architecture/green-buildings/). In fact, Architectural Digest recognized Pittsburgh as one of the most climate-resilient cities in the U.S. in 2023. It’s fitting that the birthplace of renowned environmentalist Rachel Carson has followed in her footsteps to set an example by renewing, reclaiming and redeveloping its environment through a series of lasting public-private partnerships going back more than 65 years—from the first air quality legislation to robust reclamation of Brownfield sites and river cleanups—and now ranks among the top cities in the United States for green-certified building space.

As the front door and first impression for millions of annual travelers to the Pittsburgh region, [**Pittsburgh International Airport**](https://flypittsburgh.com/) is currently undergoing a [**Terminal Modernization Program**](https://pittransformed.com/) with plans to reveal new airport facilities in 2025 that will aim to comply with LEED® Silver certification, better reflect and serve the community, inspire the industry and advance the region’s role as a world leader in innovation.

Beyond the new terminal, airport leaders are continuously improving facilities both on and around the airfield, with intentions of reducing overall energy, emissions, water and waste across airport facilities by 2030. In fact, in 2021, Pittsburgh International became the first airport in the world completely powered by an independent, first-of-its-kind microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and using on-site natural gas, increasing resilience and maximizing public safety.

When planning accommodations in Pittsburgh, travelers have a wide array of comfortable and environmentally friendly hotels.

Pittsburgh is incredibly walkable with more than 180 miles of trails throughout the nine [**Allegheny County Parks**](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/parks/index.aspx), 700+ public stairways and numerous [**walkable bridges**](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/25-famous-pittsburgh-bridges/).

Among the trails and parks along the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers, visitors will find evidence of the Pittsburgh Redbud Project, an exciting initiative of the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy planting more than 3,500 flowering Eastern redbud trees over the past five years. In addition to the pretty blooms and flowers that can be viewed in the spring and summer months, the Pittsburgh Redbud Project has undertaken riparian buffer restoration efforts along the three rivers. Since 2016, non-native, invasive plants have been replaced with thousands of native trees, shrubs and perennial plants that are providing food and habitat for wildlife and improving water and air quality.
