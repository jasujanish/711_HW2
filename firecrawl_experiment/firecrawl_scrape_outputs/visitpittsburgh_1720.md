# GLOWLAND \| Pittsburgh's Premier Winter Lighting Festival

Illuminating Oakland Nov. 22-Dec. 14

Let it Glow. Let it Gloooooooow. Ok, now that that's stuck in your head, it's time to learn about GLOWLAND:

Entering its second year, [GLOWLAND](http://www.glowlandpgh.com/) enlivens the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh through light, art, music and play through a variety of interactive installations and special events. It's perfect for [winter family fun](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pittsburgh-holiday-lights/), date night and friend groups to check out. Powered by the [Oakland Business Improvement District](http://oaklandpittsburgh.com/) (OBID), GLOWLAND illuminates two square miles of the Oakland civic and commercial district, including this year’s signature installation, LED Circle Swings.

**Nov. 22 - Dec. 14**

LED Circle Swings are the highlight of GLOWLAND for the 2024 holiday season, located in Forbes Digital Plaza. If you enjoyed EXposure in 2023 and the light up, musical seesaws in 2022, the LED Circle Swings are taking the interactive art to the next level with an even more engaging display.

This participative installation is composed of large LED swings by [Prevail Activations](https://www.prevailactivations.com/). Visitors are invited to explore and play with the swings as they change colors. Be sure to bring your camera: these interactive displays foster togetherness and will make for some of your favorite pics of the family and your loved ones during the holiday season.
