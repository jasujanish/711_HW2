# About Office of Management and Budget

The mission of the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB") is to ensure the effective and efficient use of available resources in order to sustain the delivery of quality services to the residents of the City of Pittsburgh.

The Office of Management and Budget is organized into the following core teams to strengthen citywide financial and grant management:

## Management

This team provides overall leadership and direction for the City and oversees departmental planning and management functions.

## **Capital and Asset Management**

This team is responsible for the preparation and implementation of the annual capital budget and six-year capital improvement program; planning and administration of the City’s asset management function; and the development and financial oversight of the City’s long-term infrastructure investment plan.

## **Community Development**

This team coordinates programs that provide the City with resources to address a wide range of unique community needs. The primary goals of the Community Development Division are to improve housing conditions; foster community and economic development; improve public facilities; and improve and enhance the quality of life for residents of the City of Pittsburgh, most specifically those with low-income. These initiatives are funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and include the following programs: Community Development Block Grant ('CDBG"), Home Investment Partnership ('HOME"), Emergency Shelter Grant ("ESG"), and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS ("HOPWA").

## **Operating and Special Revenue**

This team is responsible for the preparation and implementation of the annual operating budget and five-year forecast; long-term financial planning; financial policy development; maximizing opportunities to pursue, secure, and effectively administer grants from federal, state, county, corporate, and foundation partners; leading the transformation of the City’s finance functions, talent, processes, and technologies; and the management of enterprise-wide projects that will have a significant financial and/or operational impact. The Grants Office is housed within this group.

## **Procurement**

This team is responsible for organizing and directing the day-to-day operations of the procurement function; driving improvements in procurement processes, policies, and technology; and implementing cost management initiatives related to procurement, warehousing, and inventory management.
