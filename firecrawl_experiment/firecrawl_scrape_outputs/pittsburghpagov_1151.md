# Protect Our Refuse Workers

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/dpw/images/3772_protect-works.jpg)

Did you know? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, refuse/recycling collection is one of the most dangerous jobs in America. Look out for our workers and your neighbors:

- Help limit exposure to germs by setting trash out for collection in substantial, leak-proof bags tied up and without tears.
- Follow these guidelines to safely set out your medical waste, sharps, broken glass, and metals [Medical Waste & Sharps(PDF,Â 545KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/2/dpw/documents/medical-waste-and-sharps.pdf)
- Please stay back 50 feet from refuse and recycling vehicles
- Slow down and look for workers before you attempt to go around any truck
- Follow the proper set-out guidelines to prevent work-related injury
- Do not include any prohibited materials in your curbside trash

For more information on disposal of hazardous items, please check out our pages on [accepted materials](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Resident-Services/Trash-Recycling/Curbside-Pick-Up/Curbside-Refuse), [household hazardous waste](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Resident-Services/Trash-Recycling/Curbside-Pick-Up/Curbside-Refuse), and if you have any other questions not found here you can call 311.
