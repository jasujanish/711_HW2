# Small Cell Facilities

## Overview

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/domi/images/17952_domi-small-cell.jpg)Small Cell Facilities are the equipment and network components, including antennas, transmitters, and receivers, used by wireless providers to supplement existing cellular data networks.

Volume, height, and placement limitations for small cell wireless facilities are established in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 2018 Ruling ( [FCC 18-133(PDF, 732KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/domi/documents/fcc-18-133a1.pdf)), and [PA](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/uconsCheck.cfm?yr=2021&sessInd=0&act=50) HB Act 50 Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act. The City of Pittsburgh is obligated to accommodate small wireless facilities in the City’s public right-of-way consistent with these statutes.

Related City policies and ordinances have been created or adjusted to comply with state and federal statutes.

## Our Role

The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) provides guidance and permit procedure on the location, design, and construction of proposed small cell facilities that provide telecommunication service in the public right-of-way (ROW). DOMI Permits these devices as telecommunications poles or telecommunications antennas, depending on the type of facility.

[Guidance for Small Cell Facilities(PDF, 669KB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/domi/documents/17091_small_cell_guidance_web_final__1.21.22__signed.pdf) provides direction in the application process and design instructions meant to serve as a supplement to the City’s [Small Cell Aesthetic Standards(PDF, 5MB)](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/domi/documents/14034_small_cell_aesthetic_guidelines.pdf). This guidance applies to the public ROW under the stewardship of DOMI. It does not extend to any public lot, park, other public property, or private property.

All contractors must be issued a Telecommunications ROW Use Agreement and receive a permit before any work may begin.

Small cell facilities are subject to inspection, annually.
