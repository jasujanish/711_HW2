The city’s Department of Public Works will coordinate with the Pittsburgh Parking Authority (PPA) for the enforcement component of the street sweeping campaign.<br>In the early part of the pandemic the city made street sweeping parking enforcement accommodations for residents.

This year, there will be no postponement of fines for parked vehicles.<br>Street sweeping with enforcement of parked vehicles allows crews to perform the most thorough cleaning of city streets. “During the pandemic, when we had higher volumes of parked vehicles, there was an increase in street litter as well as garbage in our storm water system,” explains Chris Hornstein, Director of the Department of Public Works. “Having open roads allows our crews to better clean Pittsburgh’s streets and prevents additional waste from entering the system.”<br>Street sweepers operate every day of the week, with neighborhoods focused on Monday through Thursday. On Fridays, sweepers are typically assigned to the main corridors and business districts. Posted signs in each neighborhood list which days street cleaning is performed. <br>The street sweeping season runs from April 1 - November 30.<br>All questions regarding enforcement for street sweeping should be directed to PPA.<br>### | 29/3/2023 13:45:55 |

| City of Pittsburgh Announces Construction Kick-Off at the Oliver Bath House | **City of Pittsburgh Announces Construction Kick-Off at the Oliver Bath House**<br>**PITTSBURGH —** The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works (DPW) yesterday hosted a ceremonial groundbreaking and construction kick-off event at the Oliver Bath House.<br>Originally constructed in 1915 as the South Side Bath House, the Oliver Bath House was a gift to the city of Pittsburgh from steel magnate Henry W. Oliver. Oliver promised the building and a monetary gift—in the form of Consolidated Coal Company stocks—in order to create a bath house that would be free for the people to use in perpetuity.<br>“The Oliver Bath House is an iconic and heavily used resource by the South Side Flats and surrounding neighborhoods. It gives our lifeguards a place to train, our youth a place to learn to swim, and our community a place to gather,” said Chris Hornstein, Director of the Department of Public Works. “DPW is proud to serve as the vehicle for realizing the community’s vision and restoring this beautiful space.” <br>Located in the historic South Side Flats neighborhood, the beloved Bath House was registered as a city Historic Landmark in February 2017. This project has been long anticipated by the community, DPW, CitiParks and Council District 3; with a lengthy project timeline.<br>“CitiParks knows that the Oliver Bath House is a beloved favorite for Pittsburgh swimmers. We are extremely excited to have our partners at the Department of Public Works moving forward on this renovation project and look forward to the grand reopening when work is complete,” added Kathryn Vargas, Director of Parks and Recreation.<br>In 2019, the Department of Public Works began the process of evaluating the facility for renovation. The original scope of work included mostly interior repairs—updated shower facilities, changing rooms, etc.—full window replacements, updated mechanical systems, and a new roof at a cost of about $1.5 million.<br>The bath house closed in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Simultaneously, DPW was initiating the planning and discovery phase for renovation with the architecture firm Buchart Horn Architects. It quickly became apparent that considerably more work was needed to bring the facility up to code. The scope expanded to include:<br>- Full replacement of the basement steel structure, including sidewalk replacement and new guardrail<br>- Complete roof replacement, including the roof deck<br>- Repair and preservation, not replacement, of the historic window frames and new glass throughout<br>- Demolition of the caretaker’s rooftop apartment and installation of a new rooftop HVAC unit with integral pool dehumidification<br>- Brick and limestone facade cleaning and repointing<br>- Repairs to the pool walls and deck, including: new gutter system and drains, total replacement of the filtration and water chemistry system, and updated lighting<br>- Repairs to the mezzanine level structure and railing<br>- Hazardous materials remediation<br>- Additional exterior restoration and conservation to retain historic character<br>- Accessibility & inclusivity: modifications to allow for ADA access<br>- Features to make the building as functional, low-maintenance, and energy-efficient as possible<br>At an updated expected budget of nearly $9 million, the planned renovations will respect character defining features of the space while bringing this building back to life so that it can once again be a usable asset for City residents.<br>Contractors—Allegheny Construction Group, East West Manufacturing & Supply, and Wheels Mechanical Contracting—are already on-site and initial construction work has begun.<br>The full renovation is expected to be completed and the bath house reopened in Fall 2024.<br>### | 28/4/2023 10:35:53 |

| City of Pittsburgh Announces Last Phase of Blue Recycling Bin Distribution to Begin June 6 in Western Neighborhoods | **City of Pittsburgh Announces Last Phase of Blue Recycling Bin Distribution to Begin June 6 in Western Neighborhoods**<br>**PITTSBURGH —** The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works (DPW) Environmental Services Bureau will begin the fifth and final phase of distribution of 32-gallon blue curbside recycling bins to city residents on June 6. The distribution program is part of the city’s multi-year transition away from a bag-based to a bin-based recycling program.<br>This last phase will serve homes in the remaining northern and western neighborhoods. <br>When using the blue bins, residents must loosely place recyclables without plastic bags, which can jam equipment at processing facilities. Residents can deposit into the bins glass and plastic bottles, jugs and jars (lids removed), aluminum and steel cans, and mixed paper. Clean cardboard must be flattened, boxed and placed next to the bin.<br>“This method of recycling, where all recyclable materials are combined in one container, makes it easy for people to develop the habit of recycling,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “The more people recycling, the less waste we have blowing across our streets. Less litter makes our city a more beautiful and welcoming place where all can thrive.”<br>Prior to receiving the new recycling bins, residents will receive notification via U.S. Mail announcing when to anticipate the arrival of their new blue curbside recycling container, along with information on what can and cannot be placed in the bin.<br>Rehrig Pacific Company (RPC) holds the contract for the manufacture and distribution of the bins. RPC will deliver a 32-gallon blue recycling bin with tight-fitting lid to each designated residence. Each bin—manufactured in Pennsylvania—will come with an information packet describing its proper use, and each bin is scanned and linked to a specific address. Smaller, 18-gallon totes, are available as an alternative on a request basis by contacting the 311 City Response Center.<br>The blue bin rollout began in Fall 2020. Over a three-year period, the City of Pittsburgh will have distributed over 100,000 blue recycling bins to those they service—single family homes, duplexes, and apartment buildings with five or fewer units—with the goal of curbside recycling being bag free. <br>Funding for the Blue Bin Rollout is provided in part by a grant from The Recycling Partnership, a national NGO advancing the circular economy by building a better recycling system in U.S. communities and states, with support from the American Beverage’s Every Bottle Back initiative and the Pennsylvania Beverage Association. The grant includes funding for the final 50,000 bins, as well as education and outreach about the new collection process.<br>Residents can learn more about the blue bin rollout program and recycling in the City of Pittsburgh by visiting the [website](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/recycling-blue-bins) or by contacting 311. <br>### | 1/6/2023 14:13:06 |

Residents can also type ‘PGH.St’ into any internet browser and search by property address for that information.<br>In the past, if residents placed cardboard boxes out on non-recycling weeks, the city would collect them in order to keep the streets clean. However, in 2024 this will no longer take place. Since clean cardboard boxes is recyclable, it will be treated no differently than recycling bins full of bottles and cans. Cardboard boxes must be flattened and bundled into manageable size for crews to collect on the designated weeks.<br>Also starting in the new year, the City will no longer accept recycling in plastic bags. Residents are directed to place recyclables loosely in their recycle bin at the curb. Residents should consider designating a recycling bin, basket or bag within their home to collect recyclables, so they can easily be dumped loosely into their curbside recycling bin. **Recycling placed on the curb in plastic bags will not be picked up and may be tagged for violation.** Plastic bags cause excessive waste, slow recycling operations, and clog sorting machinery – leading to equipment damage, higher maintenance costs, and potential injuries. To properly dispose of plastic bags and films, place them in your trash or take them to a plastic bag recycling drop-off bin, available at some local retailers.<br>Businesses can help support residents in this initiative by complying with Pittsburgh’s Plastic Bag Ban and eliminating plastic bags at the source. As the City begins stricter enforcement of the bag ban, businesses are reminded that they must stop distributing plastic bags, begin charging a minimum of $0.10 for each paper bag distributed, and post signage informing customers of the ban.<br>It is the resident’s responsibility to follow the recycling and disposal guidelines required by the city.<br>Additional information about all things trash and recycling with the Bureau of Environmental Services can be found at [https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/environmental-services](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/environmental-services).<br>**###** | 28/12/2023 10:21:20 |

| PARKS AND TRAILS REOPENED FOLLOWING FLOOD | **PARKS AND TRAILS REOPENED FOLLOWING FLOOD**<br>_**All Parks & Trails Previously Closed Due To Flood Reopened**_<br>**PITTSBURGH** – Today, after historic flooding and a massive cleanup effort lead by our Department of Public Works (DPW) all parks and trails that were closed due to flood waters are now reopened.  <br>The closures which affected resident’s ability to commute and parks near the Central Business District were the result of a multiple day span of rainstorms. The several-day downpour resulted in over five inches of precipitation and in turn a 28.8-foot high-water mark.  <br>“I want to thank everyone who had a hand in this momentous cleaning effort, especially our hardworking crews in the Department of Public Works,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “As I’ve said many times, we should always be willing to give credit where its due. Today we owe a great deal of thanks to our DPW crews.” <br>Clean-up work began immediately after the confirmation that sites were safe to enter on Saturday morning and continued until Wednesday morning. DPW crew mobilized in full force to clear areas of considerable debris. <br>Follow the Department of Public Works on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PghDPW) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PGHDPW) for critical updates.   <br>**###** | 11/4/2024 17:45:36 |
