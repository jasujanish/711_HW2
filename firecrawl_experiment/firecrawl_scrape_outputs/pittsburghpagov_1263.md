## Where Should I Put My Envelope of Life?

The Envelope only works if paramedics can find it!

Here are few tips for making your envelope easy to find:

- Display the envelope with the City of Pittsburgh seal facing OUT so that it is visible.
- Attach the envelope to a prominent place in your house – a refrigerator, a door or somewhere else a paramedic can easily find it.
- Keep a copy at home and one in your wallet or purse. Emergencies don't just happen at home!
