## 1\. Overview

The City of Pittsburgh, Department of City Planning and its partners recognize that renters want housing stability in addition to affordability. Housing insecurity is a very serious issue that many residents face, and can result from a variety of factors. Whether you are a renter in need of assistance, an advocate looking to expand your network, or a non-profit looking for funding, this section may help you find the resources that you need.

[Know your rights - Landlord - Tenant Law in Allegheny County](https://law-pitt.libguides.com/c.php?g=1415200)

The University of Pittsburgh’s School of Law provides information on various housing terms that are relevant in negotiating residential leases and resolving residential rental disputes within Allegheny County. To learn more about basic tenant rights, visit the link above.

[Know your rights - Housing Equality Center of Pennsylvania](https://renters.equalhousing.org/)

The Housing Equality Center of Pennsylvania aims to improve the lives of renters in Pennsylvania by educating others about state and federal Fair Housing laws and Pennsylvania Landlord Tenant Law. The link above provides knowledge, particularly as it pertains to renting private residential property, about fair housing, eviction, repairs, and security deposits.

## 2\. Housing Justice Peer Network

Representatives from the Allegheny County Public Defender's Office, 1Hood Media, the Community Justice Project, and City of Pittsburgh Department of City Planning are working together as part of an 8-city cohort with the Housing Justice Peer Network. The Housing Justice Peer Network is a joint initiative between the NYU Furman Center's [Housing Solutions Lab](https://localhousingsolutions.org/lab/) and the [Center for Justice Innovation](https://www.innovatingjustice.org/). The purpose of the Network is to provide space for local governments, advocates, elements of the criminal justice system, and justice-involved individuals to discuss housing issues facing justice-involved individuals. The end goal of the 18-month program is for Network participants to develop policies that address housing insecurity within their jurisdictions for justice-involved individuals.

There are efforts and resources aimed at addressing evictions as well as reentry programs for people leaving the criminal justice system. The group from the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County Public Defender's Office have identified and plan on exploring ways to assist currently incarcerated individuals and their families in maintaining their housing during the period of incarceration.

## 6\. Right to Counsel

Because housing related cases are classified as civil, there is no right to automatic legal representation. This means that in the case of a housing related dispute, defendants are not automatically assigned a public defender. The right to counsel only applies to criminal cases. In civil cases, counsel is allowed but not automatically provided by the court system.

However, there are legal resources that can assist tenants in housing disputes. As of 2024, a statewide right-to-counsel program has been launched. $2.5 million has been allocated and will be divided among legal aid programs and organizations around the state.

[URA Legal Assistance Program](https://www.ura.org/pages/housing-legal-assistance)

As of February 2025, a bill [proposed by Councilwoman Deb Gross](https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2024-07-23/pittsburgh-city-councilor-to-propose-bill-that-offers-legal-help-to-some-renters-facing-eviction) was passed that allows for the Mayor and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to enter into a singular agreement or more with the URA in which the cost cannot amount to more than $2 million in a year.

Pennsylvania State: Automatic Sealing of Eviction Records

Eviction filings remain on renters' permanent records, even if a renter is able to challenge the eviction and win. Governor Josh Shapiro proposes to [automatically seal eviction records](https://www.pa.gov/governor/newsroom/2025-press-releases/watch--importance-of-gov-shapiro-s-proposal-seal-eviction-record.html#:~:text=Harrisburg%2C%20PA%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Josh%20Shapiro's,who%20were%20never%20legally%20evicted.) of Pennsylvania residents who were never legally evicted.
