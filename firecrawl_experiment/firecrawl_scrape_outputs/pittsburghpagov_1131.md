## Community Festival Program Grant

In existence since 1977, the Community Festival Program Grant has provided funding to help communities introduce and maintain neighborhood-focused festivals for over 40 years. The program's goal is to provide financial assistance to community groups so they may launch and develop an annual event to bring together their community and foster togetherness. Grantees are selected by committee and based on specific criteria. All approved grant applications receive up to $1,000.00 in reimbursed funds to assist with operations of their festivals.

The festival season is from June 1 to October 31.

### **Who is eligible to receive a CFP grant?**

To be eligible for funding, your organization and event must meet **all** of the following criteria:

1. Applicant must be a non-profit, tax-exempt, Pittsburgh community-based organization;
2. The organization must have been in existence for at least three years;
3. The festival must be _free and open to the public (festival cannot charge admission or otherwise condition entry to the event)_, and to the benefit of the community at large;
4. The festival may take place over more than one day, however, in alignment with program goals, priority will be focused on one-day events.
