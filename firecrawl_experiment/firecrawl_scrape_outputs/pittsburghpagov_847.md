The City of Pittsburgh's mentor program will provide a welcoming environment and accurate information regarding Police Officer career opportunities within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. Mentors will provide helpful information that keeps the candidates engaged in the process and possibly helps him/her identify career targets. The mentoring program should have a positive impact on the City's ability to retain, encourage and provide support for candidates. There are seven mentors who will answer questions candidates submit to the policementors@pittsburghpa.gov. These mentors are successful and dedicated veteran officers who are volunteering to assist candidates by guiding and supporting them through the recruitment process.

Send an e-mail to [policementors@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:policementors@pittsburghpa.gov) to speak with a mentor.
