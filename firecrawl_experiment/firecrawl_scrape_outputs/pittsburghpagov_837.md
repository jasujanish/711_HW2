# Disc Golf

**Enjoy a different kind of golf - disc golf!**

Visit the 18-hole Disc Golf Course in Schenley Park. This course stretches from the Meadow to the Vietnam Veterans Pavilion and winds its way through the park's wooded areas.

The course offers three tee positions to accommodate the first-time player as well as the seasoned pro.

You can also stop by the Phillips Park Disc Golf Course in Carrick and play on a nine-hole course designed and built by high school students!
