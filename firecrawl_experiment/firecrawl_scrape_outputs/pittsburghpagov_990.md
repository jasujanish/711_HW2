Satisfy your appetite for fresh-picked fruits and vegetables by visiting farmers markets presented by CitiParks.

All markets sell farm-fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, cheese and baked goods, while several locations also sell flowers, small gifts and hot prepared foods to go. All markets accept food stamps (SNAP), credit and debit cards as part of Just Harvest's Fresh Access program.

**2025 Farmers Market Season begins May 11, 2025!**

**All 4 CitiParks Farmers Markets accept food stamps (SNAP), credit and debit cards as part of Just Harvest's Fresh Access program.**

Shoppers with SNAP benefits can get fresh, nutritious and local-grown food, including produce, meat, dairy, bread and baked goods, produce plants, seeds and honey. (Hot prepared food items, alcohol and non-food items are not eligible for SNAP purchases.) Food Bucks give Fresh Access food stamp shoppers extra money to spend on fruits and veggies. For every $5 spent in food stamps, receive an extra $2 to spend on produce.  For 2025 Market Season, Just Harvest will add another $3 to this thanks to a generous grant from the Food Justice Fund—thus doubling SNAP Benefits at all CitiParks Farmers Markets in the 2025 Season.
