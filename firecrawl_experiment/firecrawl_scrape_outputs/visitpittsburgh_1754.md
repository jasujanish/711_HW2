# Troy Hill: Neighborhood Guide

I'll be honest: when I first knew I wanted to write about Troy Hill, I was unsure exactly why I was so charmed by it. But as I walked around this quirky area filled with art and surprises around every hillside, I was reminded of my stay on Montmarte in Paris. It's hilly, the views of the city are just as beautiful as Mt. Washington and it's, above all, an authentic representation of the Pittsburgh I love so much.

Lace up your best walking shoes, because we're ascending hundreds of steps to spend an afternoon or evening in Troy Hill, a true hidden gem Pittsburgh neighborhood.

## EXPLORE

Pittsburgh is known for its staircases. In fact, it has more publicly accessible stairs than anywhere else in the country. So it's appropriate that your Troy Hill itinerary starts on **Rialto St.**, which features one of the steepest (and narrowest) roads in the city accompanied by nearly 500 feet of stairs to reach the heart of the Troy Hill neighborhood. Elsewhere in this neighborhood (look for dotted lines on Google Maps indicating them) you can find staircases connecting to side streets and all the way down to Pittsburgh's Northside, sometimes jutting between houses and other times ending in parks or right by a brewery. There's even a [self-guided walking tour](https://troyhillsteps.com/) you can take that highlight eight staircases including Rialto.

Regardless of where you choose to walk, it's impossible to miss the beautiful art that surrounds you in Troy Hill. Murals adorn many of the main streets through town and there's historical buildings and markers aplenty. Make sure to peer in the windows of **[Gallery Closed](https://www.galleryclosed.org/)**, a permanently open art gallery you view entirely through the windows, with seasonal exhibits that sometimes spill out into neighboring windows and business. Your entire visit to Troy Hill can be done by driving or walking through this area and you'd still be satisfied.

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271%27%20height%3D%271%27%20style%3D%27background%3Atransparent%27%2F%3E)

Just one example of the staircases in Troy Hill. This one goes right between two houses on the way down.

If you have some extra time to explore, be sure to book a visit (free, but advanced reservations required) to one of the [**Troy Hill Art Houses**.](https://www.troyhillarthouses.com/) While these homes may look normal from the outside, the insides have been renovated into a total structure art piece. From the incredible lighthouse-within-a-house of the Darkhouse Lighthouse, photography-inspired Kunzhaus and inspired use of everyday objects in La Hütte Royal, find the house that calls to you!

Churches dot the landscape of Troy Hill, but one in particular is a must-see for anyone interested in religion or history. [**St. Anthony's Chapel**](https://pghshrines.org/about-st-anthony-chapel) contains more than 5,000 relics of the Roman Catholic faith including the skulls of martyred saints, fragments of the cross that Jesus was crucified on, a piece of Mary's veil and bones from all 12 of Jesus' disciples.

Before you descend from Troy Hill, make sure you enjoy the views of Pittsburgh. While our Inclines get a ton of well-deserved attention, from this neighborhood you can see the opposite view of our city looking from the north. Follow Goettmann St. and you can see Pittsburgh reveal itself as you look out over the Allegheny River. Follow it to the end for a one-of-a-kind view on Province St. with the city in the backdrop, then descend the public stairs right to Penn Brewery.

The lookout along Goettman St. matches any in Pittsburgh with views of the Strip District and Downtown

## DRINK

Whew, all that walking and stairclimbing made me thirsty. Luckily, Troy Hill is home to **[Penn Brewery](https://www.pennbrew.com/)**, Pittsburgh's oldest craft brewery dating back all the way to 1986. If you love German brews, start with their flagship Penn Pilsner or Penn Dark (my personal fave) or look for specialty styles like their pumpkin roll or Oktoberfest depending on when you visit. Their beautiful outdoor biergarten is the perfect place to sip and enjoy their menu of both German and Pittsburgh favorites from potato pancakes and pork schnitzel to pierogi and french fries on your salad.

I know this is technically in Spring Garden, but **[Threadbare Cider](https://threadbarecider.com/)** is an easy add to your Troy Hill itinerary while you're in the neighborhood. On the menu are refreshing, delicious ciders including pear, cherry, pineapple and northern spy, plus new creations like their lemonade cider crushers and canned ciders, too. Another great all-in-one location, you can stay here for evening as you sip ciders and enjoy fresh pizzas in their cute indoor space or spacious outdoor seating.

**[De Fer](https://www.defer.coffee/troy-hill)** serves up great coffee and tea all across the city, but their Troy Hill location is easily my favorite. The interior, decorated by Burgh-based artist Baron Batch, is bright, filled with art and maybe has the best vibes in the entire city. Grab a bag of coffee to tag home as a souvenir, but before you leave, head up to the rooftop deck for a 360-degree view of all of Troy Hill.

## EAT

When I'm visiting Troy Hill outside of work, it's usually to head to the new seasonal menu at [**Scratch & Co.**](https://www.scratchandcopgh.com/#), one of my favorite restaurants in the Burgh right now. Scratch has all you expect from a fine dining restaurant but keeps the ambiance and service down-to-earth and inviting so that every visit is a memorable experience. Just don't fall in love with any one dish here. True to its name, Scratch is constantly changing up the menu to incorporate seasonal veg and locally sourced proteins to make every bite magic.

There's also great local spots to chow down if you just want a quick, delicious meal. [**Tammy's Place**](https://tammyspgh.wpcomstaging.com/) has a great view of the city and is always filled with friendly locals as you enjoy bar fare and an IC Light. **Ron's Pizza Palace** and **Frank's Pizza & Chicken** are both reliable, local go-tos for wings and za.

I hope I've sold you on what makes Troy Hill absolutely worth a visit while you explore Pittsburgh and a hidden gem full of hidden gems. Even if you're a local that has never been, this neighborhood, like so much else in Pittsburgh, will surprise you. I hope to pass on the stairs up and down Rialto!

I would come back to Troy Hill 100x just for this mushroom toast from Scratch & Co.
