# University Professors

The title of University Professor is the highest designation a faculty member can receive at Carnegie Mellon. University Professors are distinguished by international recognition and for their contributions to education, artistic creativity and/or research. Founded in 1968 with the installation of Clarence Zener directly by University President Guyford Stever, each class of new University Professors exemplifies this high level of achievement and commitment to both the university and the broader academic communities.
