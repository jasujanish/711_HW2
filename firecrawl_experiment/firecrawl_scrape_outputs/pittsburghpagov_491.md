**Pittsburgh, PA** (May 16, 2022) — Pittsburgh City Councilman Bobby Wilson (District 1) introduced [legislation](https://pittsburgh.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5652685&GUID=9B3B7DC2-C95F-41D5-80E5-3AA9EC668449) this week to permit recreational camping for youth groups in the City of Pittsburgh’s parks.

“I am excited to work with the Outdoor Inclusion Coalition to introduce this bill,” said Councilman Wilson. “At Riverview Park on the Northside, these organizations are planning to open a Gear Lending Library so that families and children who live near this great regional park but lack access to hiking and camping gear can check out the supplies they need to get outside. Access to backpacks, sleeping bags, and tents will improve physical and mental health outcomes and build a stronger and more diverse outdoor community. The first step in getting outdoors was introducing a bill to permit camping in our City’s great parks.”

This bill empowers the Director of the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Parks and Recreation to permit camping in City parks. This department will also promulgate regulations and guidelines regarding camping in City parks. Kathryn Vargas, Director of Parks and Recreation, added, “Camping is a unique experience that can cultivate a life-changing connection to the outdoors. By providing this experience in our own backyard, we are expanding access to quality outdoor recreation activities for all young people that live in the City of Pittsburgh.”

For press inquiries, please contact Councilman Wilson’s Legislative Aide, Mohammed Burny, at (412) 215-0528 or [mohammed.burny@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:mohammed.burny@pittsburghpa.gov).
