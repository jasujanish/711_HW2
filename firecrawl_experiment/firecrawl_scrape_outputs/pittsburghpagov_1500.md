# Policy on Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Disability

In accordance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the City of Pittsburgh does not discriminate against individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability in its services, programs, or activities. If you are a person with a disability and require information or materials in an appropriate alternative format or if you require any other accommodation please contact the City staff. Advance notification will help to ensure the City is able to make reasonable arrangements to ensure accessibility. You may also contact the City ADA Coordinator.

## Employment

The City of Pittsburgh does not discriminate on the basis of disability in its hiring or employment practices and complies with all regulations under the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Title I of the ADA.

## Effective Communication

Upon request, the City of Pittsburgh will generally provide appropriate aids and services to ensure effective communication for persons with disabilities so that they can participate equally in its programs, services, and activities.

## Modifications

The City of Pittsburgh will make all reasonable modifications to policies and programs to ensure that people with disabilities have equal opportunity to enjoy its programs services, and activities.

The City of Pittsburgh will not place a surcharge on a particular individual with a disability or any group of individuals with disabilities to cover the cost of providing auxiliary aids/services or reasonable modifications of policy.
