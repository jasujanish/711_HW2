Allegheny Commons has anchored the North Side for over 150 years. The public commons predate the City of Pittsburgh's annexation of Allegheny City. This treasured Victorian gem is our oldest park and recalls the grandeur of Central Park.

The Allegheny Commons were officially established and designated for common pasture in a plan for the Town of Allegheny in 1784.

Three years later, the Act of Assembly which created Allegheny in 1787 stated, "...and within the said town, 100 acres for a common pasture..." Of the original 100 acres, 84 acres have remained as a park. It was officially dedicated for park purposes by Allegheny City in 1867.

The park was designed by the firm of Mitchell and Grant in 1867 utilizing a combination of formal, classical planning and picturesque landscape design which was ideally suited to its unique site. The park saw significant changes to some of its features during urban renewal efforts in the 1960's. Today, efforts are underway to restore the park to its former glory.

**Lake Elizabeth**(show below)

Lake Elizabeth is named for Elizabeth Kirschler the daughter of Charles F. Kirschler, the final Mayor of Allegheny City.

A fixture since the parks opening, the lake was a popular space for swimming, boating, and skating. The lake came to its current form in the 1960's. As part of the Allegheny Center conversion by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, the lake was redesigned as a concrete water feature with pedestrian bridges.

Efforts are currently underway by the City of Pittsburgh, Parks Conservancy, and North Side community to redesign the lake to more closely resemble its original intent.

**Patricia Regan Rooney Memorial Fountain**(show below)

![](https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/parks/images/parks/13923_fountain.jpg)The original Northeast Fountain was built in 1868 when Allegheny City officially turned the pasture into a park. The fountain was demolished sometime during the City of Pittsburgh's Renaissance One urban renewal efforts and buried on site.

A partnership by the City of Pittsburgh, Parks Conservancy, Allegheny Commons Initiative, and Northside Leadership Conference restored the landmark fountain in 2019. It was dedicated after campaign chairwoman and longtime North Side parks advocate, Patricia Regan Rooney in 2021.

The City of Pittsburgh opened the $340,000 facility on August 10, 1952, two years after ground was broken. The facility was built on the site of the original Phipps Conservatory which had been destroyed by fire.

At its beginning, the Pittsburgh Aviary consisted of a walkthrough tropical marsh. In 1967 an expansion that featured the wetland rooms was constructed. In the 1980's the Aviary began to move towards its mission of wildlife conservation.

The Aviary was operated by the Department of Parks & Recreation until 1993. At that time, a declaration by the United States Congress gave the institution honorary "National Status". Today, the National Aviary is managed by a private non-profit organization in the City of Pittsburgh's behalf.
