# About the Gender Equity Commission

## Mission & Vision

The **mission** of the Gender Equity Commission is to ensure that people of all gender identities are treated fairly and equitably within City of Pittsburgh. Our **vision** is a future in which everyone in the City of Pittsburgh, regardless of gender identity or expression, is safe in all spaces, empowered to achieve their full potential, and no longer faces structural or institutional barriers to economic, social, and political equality.

## About the GEC

[Ordinance No. 34 Chapter 177C](https://ecode360.com/45432456), passed by the Mayor and City Council in December 2016, created the Gender Equity Commission (GEC). The GEC is responsible for identifying and addressing discrimination that disproportionately impacts specific gender identities , including women, girls, femmes, transgender and non-binary individuals, in the City of Pittsburgh. The GEC was created based upon the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The Commission creates recommendations, policies, research and action plans that identify and address gender inequities, specially centering the communities that experience the most harm from these systemic issues. The GEC works with the Mayor’s Office, City Council, City Departments, and community members to develop plans, solve disparities and create more equity within the City of Pittsburgh.

The focus areas within the GEC Ordinance prioritize specific systems in which gender inequity is often identified. These areas may include but are not limited to:

- Education, including free or affordable early childhood education; support for high-quality public education; equitable out-of-school educational programs; and developed youth employment or internship opportunities.
- Economic development, comprised of employment opportunities, promotion, job security, and all benefits and conditions of service; safe and affordable housing and transportation; and access to financial services.
- Gender-Based Violence, in such areas as rehabilitation; police education and protocol when interacting with situations involving interpersonal violence; support services for victims; and gender sensitive training for City employees.
- Delivery of city services, so that gender equity permeates every level of City operations, and City services are considered and deployed using a gender equity lens.
