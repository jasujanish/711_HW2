We retain personal information in identifiable form only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the personal information was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce agreements and similar essential purposes.

**3.    FOR WHAT BUSINESS PURPOSE CAN CMU USE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THIS WAY?**

We are required to satisfy one or more of the reasons set out by applicable data privacy law before we can collect and use personal information about you.

Generally, our business purpose for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally rely on the following reasons to collect and use personal information about you:

- **Performance of a contract**



Using your information may be necessary for us to perform our obligations under a contract with you or with a view to entering into such a contract. For example, where you have: (i) purchased or enroll in our Services, we will need to use your information to provide those Services; or (ii) approached us in relation to employment opportunities, the collection and use of personal information about you is necessary to enable us to offer you the job role, process your acceptance of the offer, on-board you as an employee and fulfil our obligations as an employer.

- **Compliance with our legal obligations**



The collection and use of personal information about you may be necessary to enable us to meet our legal obligations. For example, to verify your identity and undertake necessary due diligence checks.

- **Pursuing our legitimate interests**



Where such processing is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights, we are permitted to use personal information about you where it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests, for example to operate the website and our other digital offerings, to improve our Services, content and our other digital offerings or to undertake marketing. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make this clear to you at the relevant time.

- **Consent**



In some limited circumstances, we may rely on your consent to collect and use personal information about you. For example, we may rely on consent: (i) where you have approached us in relation to employment or study opportunities and have provided us with sensitive personal information, such as information in relation to your racial and ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion, physical and mental health, disabilities or trade union membership; or (ii) in relation to the sending of e-marketing or communications.
  - If we rely on consent, this will be made clear to you at the time we request your information. You can withdraw your consent at any point by using the mechanism provided at the time, or by contacting us using the contact details provided in the section of this Privacy Notice titled “How do I contact CMU?”

You may not always be required to provide the personal information that we have requested. However, if you choose not to provide certain information, you may not be able to take advantage of some of our Services. Any information that is so required is clearly marked as mandatory. If you would prefer that we not collect certain personal information from you, please do not provide us with any such information, or opt out of providing this information where applicable.

If we collect and use personal information about you in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third-party), these interests will normally be as set out in this Privacy Notice; however, if this changes we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have any questions or need further information concerning the business purpose on which we collect and use personal information about you, please contact us using the contact details provided in the section below marked “How do I contact CMU?”

**4.    DOES CMU SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH ANYONE?**

It is the practice of CMU to protect the personal information. Access to personal information controlled or processed by CMU is restricted to only those employees or agents, contractors or subcontractors of CMU who have valid reasons to access this information to perform any service you have requested or authorized, or for any other purpose described in this Privacy Notice. _**The personal information you provide will not be sold or rented to third parties.**_

We may provide personal information about you to:

We will access, disclose and preserve personal information, when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:

- operate and maintain the security of the Services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.

**5.    COOKIES & OTHER TECHNOLOGIES**

CMU uses cookies (small, often encrypted, text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device) and similar technologies (“Cookies”) to provide the Services and help collect data.

_How We Use Cookies_

We use Cookies to track how you use the Services by providing usage statistics. Cookies are also used to deliver CMU information (including updates) based upon your browsing history and previous visits to the Services. Information supplied to us using Cookies helps us to provide a better online experience to our visitors and users and send marketing communications to them, as the case may be. Information supplied to us upon launching of the Services will enable CMU to improve the functionality of the Services.

While this information on its own may not constitute “personal information”, we may combine the information we collect via Cookies with personal information that we have collected from you to learn more about how you use the Services to improve them.

_Types of Cookies_

We use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them). To make it easier for you to understand why we need them, the Cookies we use on the Services can be grouped into the following categories:

- Strictly Necessary: These Cookies are necessary for the Services to work properly. They include any essential authentication and authorization Cookies for the Services.
- Functionality: These Cookies enable technical performance and allow us to “remember” the choices you make while browsing the Services, including any preferences you set. They also include sign-in and authentication Cookies and IDs that enable you to return without additional sign-in.
- Performance/Analytical: These Cookies allow us to collect certain information about how you navigate the Services. They help us understand which areas you use and what we can do to improve them.
- _Targeting_: These Cookies are used to deliver relevant information related to the Services to an identified machine or other device (not a named or otherwise identifiable person) which has previously been used to visit the Services. Some of these types of Cookies on the Services are operated by third parties with our permission and are used to identify advertising sources that are effectively driving users to the Services.

_Cookies Set by Third Parties_

To enhance our content and to deliver a better online experience for our users, we sometimes embed images and videos from other websites on the Services. We currently use and may in future use content from services such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. You may be presented with Cookies from these third-party websites. Please note that we do not control these Cookies. The privacy practices of these third parties will be governed by the parties’ own privacy statements or policies. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties, using Cookies or other means. You should consult and review the relevant third-party privacy statement or policy for information on how these Cookies are used and how you can control them.

We also use Google, a third-party analytics provider, to collect information about Services usage and the users of the Services, including demographic and interest-level information. Google uses Cookies in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Services, including information about the pages where users enter and exit the Services and what pages users view on the Services, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address. Cookies allow Google to recognize a user when a user visits the Services and when the user visits other websites. Google uses the information it collects from the Services and other websites to share with us and other website operators’ information about users including age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests, and details about devices used to visit websites and purchase items. We do not link information we receive from Google with any of your personally identifiable information. For more information regarding Google’s use of Cookies, and collection and use of information, see the Google Privacy Notice (available at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en ). If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (available at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).)

_How to Control and Delete Cookies_

Cookies can be controlled, blocked or restricted through your web browser settings. Information on how to do this can be found within the Help section of your browser. All Cookies are browser specific. Therefore, if you use multiple browsers or devices to access websites, you will need to manage your cookie preferences across these environments.

If you are using a mobile device to access the Services, you will need to refer to your instruction manual or other help/settings resource to find out how you can control Cookies on your device.

Please note: If you restrict, disable or block any or all Cookies from your web browser or mobile or other device, the Services may not operate properly, and you may not have access to the Services. CMU shall not be liable for any impossibility to use the Services or degraded functioning thereof, where such are caused by your settings and choices regarding Cookies.

To learn more about Cookies and web beacons, visit www.allaboutCookies.org.

_Social Sharing_

We also embed social sharing icons throughout the Services. These sharing options are designed to enable users to easily share content from the Services with their friends using a variety of different social networks. If you choose to connect using a social networking or similar service, we may receive and store authentication information from that service to enable you to log in and other information that you may choose to share when you connect with these services. These services may collect information such as the web pages you visited and IP addresses, and may set Cookies to enable features to function properly. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties. You should review the privacy statements or policies applicable to the third-party services you connect to, use, or access. If you do not want your personal information shared with your social media account provider or other users of the social media service, please do not connect your social media account with your account for the Services and do not participate in social sharing on the Services.

_Do Not Track_

Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including CMU, do not respond to DNT signals.

**6.    WHAT ARE MY DATA PROTECTION CHOICES AND RIGHTS?**

The privacy laws of some jurisdictions may provide their residents with additional rights regarding our use of personal information. The following Section applies to individuals who reside in specific jurisdictions that provide additional privacy rights.

5.1 Your Rights and Choices

_Right to Access Specific Information and Data Portability Right_. You may have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of personal information.

- The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
- Our business or commercial purpose for collecting such information.
- The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
- The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).

_Right to Correct Information_. You may have the right to request we update personal information about you that is incorrect in our systems.

_Right to Delete_. You may have the right to request that we delete any personal information about you that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) the personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.

_Right to Limit Sensitive Personal Information Use_. You may have the right to limit the use of sensitive personal information regarding you.

_Right to Object to Processing Personal Information_. You may have the right to object to the processing of personal information for the purposes of profiling or our legitimate interest.

_Non-Discrimination_. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights.

5.2 How to Exercise these Rights

To submit a request to exercise these rights you may use one of these two methods:

- Email: [privacy@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:privacy@andrew.cmu.edu)
- [Submit a Request](https://live-cmu-flagship-main.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/documents/CMU_%20Verifiable%20Consumer%20Access%20and%20Deletion%20Request%20Form_USE_Active01_311330160_1.pdf)

For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to “Your Privacy Rights,” indicate which type of request you are making, and provide your name, street address, city, state, zip code and an e-mail address or phone number where we may contact you. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly or that do not include complete information.

To appeal a decision regarding an individual rights request, please submit your appeal using one of the two methods above. Your appeal should include an explanation of the reason you disagree with our decision. Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.

You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

We endeavor to respond to a verified request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide the personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

5.3 California Shine the Light Law

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and you wish to make such a request, please send an e-mail with “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line to privacy@andrew.cmu.edu or write us at: Carnegie Mellon University, Attention: Data Protection Officer, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.

In each instance, such third-party’s privacy policy will apply to your interaction with that website or service;
- **Submit content to Social Sites**: For reviews, discussion forums, message boards, photographs and other public features (“Public Forums”). We do not restrict the distribution of personal information that you voluntarily disclose in these Public Forums, so please be aware that any information you disclose there may be collected and used by us and others. For this reason, we encourage you to refrain from providing or sharing personal information about yourself in the Public Forums. We cannot prevent third parties from using such information in a way that may violate this Privacy Notice or applicable law;
- **Sign-in to the Site using a Social Site**: For example, for a harmonized user experience.

Signing-in using a Social Site or other third-party account may allow us to access information that you have given the Social Site permission to share. The sign-in feature may also transfer information to the Social Site or third-party, such as your username or social media handle, to authenticate you. The Social Site or third-party may also automatically collect information such as your IP address, information about your browser and device, and the web page address of the Site. The sign-in feature may also place and read Cookies from that third-party that may contain a unique identifier the Social Site or other third-party assigns to you. The functionality of and your use of the sign-in is governed by the privacy policy and terms of the Social Site.

We may use personal information about you to identify you on Social Sites and to show you ads that are more relevant for you.

Again, please note that third-party sites (including the Social Sites) may be under the control of a third-party, and we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and terms of use of each third-party site.

If you have provided us with your contact information, we may, subject to any applicable Spam Act or similar regulation, contact you via e-mail, postal mail or telephone about CMU Services and events that may be of interest to you, including newsletters.

Marketing e-mail communications you receive from CMU will generally provide an unsubscribe link or instructions on how to opt-out of receiving future e-mail or to change your contact preferences. E-mail communications may also include a link to directly update and manage your marketing preferences. You can also request changes to your contact preferences by contacting CMU via email at it-help@cmu.edu or, to stop text messages by texting STOP in response to any text message.

Please remember that even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you important Services information related to your accounts and subscriptions.

**10.    DOES CMU TRANSFER PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OTHER COUNTRIES?**

CMU also collaborates with third parties such as cloud-hosting services and suppliers located around the world to serve the needs of our business, workforce, and users. To provide our Services, we may need to transfer and process personal information about you in the United States or in any other country where CMU, its affiliates or contractors maintain facilities (including to destinations outside the country in which you are located).

As a result, your information may be transferred to and/or processed in countries which may not guarantee the same level of protection for personal information as the country in which you reside. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that personal information about you will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located. For more information on how CMU transfers personal information please visit our “ [Transfer of Personal information Between Countries](https://www.cmu.edu/legal/transfer-personal-information-between-countries)” page.

Further information can be provided on request: please contact us using the details found in the section “How do I contact CMU?” We have also implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.

**11.    HOW DOES CMU SECURE PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

CMU is committed to protecting the security of personal information about you. Depending on the circumstances, we may hold your personal information in hard copy and/or electronic form. For each medium, we use technologies and procedures to protect personal information. We review our strategies and update as necessary to meet our business needs, changes in technology, and regulatory requirements.

These measures include, but are not limited to, technical and organizational security policies and procedures, security controls and employee training.

We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security, abuse, or illegal or questionable activity. If you believe that personal information you provided to us is no longer secure, for example, if your access credentials have been compromised, please notify us immediately using the contact information provided below.

If we become aware of a breach that affects the security of personal information about you, we will provide you with notice as required by applicable law.

**12.    HOW DOES CMU PROCESS CHILDREN’S DATA?**

Certain Services are intended to be used by individuals who are under the age of 13 years old (“Children” or “Child”). Services directed to Children require verifiable parental consent and acknowledgement of the [CMU Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) Notice](https://www.cmu.edu/legal/coppa-notice) prior to a Child’s participation. Consistent with the requirements of the COPPA, if we learn that we received any information directly from a Child without his or her parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to inform the Child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) that he or she cannot use the Services.

California Minors: If you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: Privacy@andrew.cmu.edu  When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it. We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third-party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don’t follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the content or information. Removal of your content or information from the Services does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.

**13.    DOES THIS PRIVACY NOTICE EVER CHANGE?**

We may update this Privacy Notice based upon evolving Laws, regulations and industry standards, or as we may make changes to our business including the Services.
