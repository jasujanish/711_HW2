| We All Are Peacekeepers | As members of the Pittsburgh community, we wanted to reach out to you ahead of this weekend's planned protests and ask for your help in keeping the peace. There has been much speculation as to who will show-up at this weekend's protests and what their intentions will be. We assure you that our officers and detectives are working to learn as much about these events as possible so we can do our best to protect our citizens and our city, but we need your help. As trusted community leaders, we are counting on you to help spread a message of peace to your community groups, churches, schools, and in the streets. We cannot and will not tolerate violence, and we do not want to be the next Charlottesville.<br>To that end, We want to make sure each of you are aware of our obligation to our residents and visitors, as well as our philosophy when it comes to handling protests.<br>First, we have a legal and ethical obligation to protect ALL protesters. White, black, Republican, Democrat, anti-police, pro-Trump, anti-Trump, pro-union, anti-union; it doesn't matter. As police officers, we are obligated to check our personal feelings at the door. We have one job to do: keep the peace and ensure everyone is afforded the opportunity to safely exercise their first amendment rights. On a personal level, we do not always agree with the opinions and beliefs of those we are sworn to protect, but as police officers, that simply doesn't matter. We will treat everybody in a fair and equitable manner. We cannot and will not pick sides.<br>Second, We want to make sure that you are aware of our philosophy on peaceful protests, so everyone has a basic understanding of why we do what we do. In general, when we are called to a protest and it is peaceful, we protect all parties involved and help facilitate the event. We will not arrest protesters who are simply exercising their constitutional rights. As a general rule, we will not arrest participants if they are doing nothing more than blocking traffic. However, if and when an event turns violent or destructive, we will take action. We cannot allow participants to cause injury or destroy property. If and when this occurs, we will make arrests.<br>In closing, We want to assure you that we are working to make this weekend's events run as smoothly as possible. There is a saying in policing that we "Hope for the best, but plan for the worst." Having dedicated and respected community leaders such as yourselves out there encouraging peace and unity is key piece of that plan.<br>Thank you all and stay safe. | 16/8/2017 17:00:07 |

| Firefighters Get New Pittsburgh-Specific Ladder Trucks | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2583_LadderTruck2.JPG)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2585_LadderTruck4.JPG)<br>(Zelienople, Pa.) May 8, 2018 -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire will soon have two new ladder trucks in operation, both of which were custom-made to allow firefighters to more easily navigate the city’s narrow and winding roadways.<br>Ladder Truck #14 will run out of Oakland; Ladder Truck #30 will be stationed in Elliott and help cover Ingram borough. The #14 truck will go into regular operations in mid-June and the #30 will start in late June. The addition of the ladder trucks means all 11 PBF front line trucks will meet the same unique Pittsburgh specifications.<br>The ladder trucks were designed through a collaboration between Glick Fire Equipment Company, Inc. in Zelienople and a committee of Pittsburgh Fire officials, including one Battalion Chief, one Captain, two Lieutenants and one firefighter. They were made by Pierce Manufacturing Inc. of Appleton, Wisconsin.<br>“They (the committee) wanted a lot of things for these trucks so they can be used on Pittsburgh’s roads,” said Jim Sims of Glick Fire Equipment Company, Inc. “They use the trucks every day so they know what they need and want.”<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2587_LadderTruck6.JPG)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2582_LadderTruck1.JPG)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2586_LadderTruck5.JPG)<br>The ladder trucks are 40 feet, 6.5 inches long, 11 feet, 10 inches high, and 96-inches wide. The standard width for ladder trucks in other cities is 101 inches, but the Pittsburgh trucks have several features that make them slimmer, including recessed grab rails and bar lights, and a recessed AC unit. The rear has been elevated and tapered to 88 inches, allowing drivers to more easily avoid obstacles on tight turns.<br>“I’m very pleased,” said Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Assistant Chief Thomas Cook. “They meet our daily service needs, they’re durable and they hold up well in the city environment.”<br>Each truck has a 525 horse-power engine, an attached 105-foot ladder and 182 feet of ground ladders. Rather than stainless steel, Glick used rubber for the fender crowns and rub railings, so that if the truck brushes against an object, the damage is lessened.<br>The trucks cost $890,000 each are funded through the regular budget of the Equipment Leasing Authority (ELA).<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2588_LadderTruck9.JPG)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2584_LadderTruck3.JPG) | 8/5/2018 15:37:24 |

| HIGHLAND PARK HILLSIDE RESCUE | **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (May 10, 2018) - An unusual ride home for evening rush hour commuters along Butler Street in Highland Park today. Members from several Bureaus within the City of Pittsburgh Public Safety Department successfully accomplished a hillside rescue mission. <br>Around 3:14 p.m., Thursday, May 10, 2018, personnel from  the Pittsburgh EMS and its Rescue Division, Bureau of Fire, and Bureau of  Police responded to a call for a man who had fallen approximately down a steep hillside near the Pittsburgh Zoo in Highland Park. Upon arrival, emergency crews located 31-year-old Vu Tran approximately a half-mile down the lightly wooded hillside. <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/2621_Rescue1.png)<br>"This is considered to be a low angle rescue," says EMS District Chief Jeffrey Meyer. " The rescue mission was interesting. The terrain was complex due to the tight space available and the extrication needed to get Mr. Tran into a medic unit," Meyer added. <br>Because of the 45-degree angle of the hillside, EMS rescuers along with firefighters from Station 8 used ropes and a basket to get personnel safely down the hillside and place Mr. Tran into a medic unit. That effort was also a challenge due to the small area. An EMS SUV was able to get down steps and onto the hillside. Mr. Tran was placed inside and transported to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital for treatment. Zone 5 police officers assisted in the rescue while keeping traffic moving and keeping the area safe and secure. <br>How did Mr. Tran end up on the hillside?

This is that time of year when there is a lot of contracted work being conducted throughout the area. <br>On Tuesday, June 27, 2018, an elderly Squirrel Hill South woman was able to successfully prevent a possible burglary inside her residence after suspected imposters gained entry.  According to the police report,  as utility crews were working nearby in the 3500 block of Beechwood Boulevard in Greenfield, two males claiming to be employees of an electric company arrived at the home and told  the victim they wanted to check for possible flooding inside the house. The suspects were permitted to enter the garage and into the basement. As the resident grew skeptical, she eventually coaxed the men outside the residence and locked them out. The resident called the utility company working nearby and confirmed they had no workers going door-to-door checking for flooding.<br>According to the victim, the suspects were not able to take anything out of the home. No injuries or property damage was reported. If anyone has any information about this incident, please give police a call at 412-323-7800. <br>To avoid becoming a victim of scammers and imposters:: <br>- Use caution when opening your door to strangers. <br>  <br>- Check the identification of any workers coming to your door.  <br>  <br>- Do not hesitate to call the company to verify the worker. <br>  <br>- When in doubt, call police for assistance. | 27/6/2018 15:11:01 |

To that end the City today is announcing three new initiatives on its responses to unpermitted demonstrations going forward. <br>The City's [guiding principle](http://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=2021) remains protecting the First Amendment rights of protesters while assuring that all people – from protesters to city residents and motorists who may be affected by road closures – are kept safe. <br>Today the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is announcing new roadway safety guidelines; crisis intervention teams to work with protesters; and work on a new de-escalation initiative. <br>Police are committed to allowing protestors to close streets during First Amendment activities, but to ensure safety the new Roadway Safety Guidelines prohibit demonstrations from blocking hospital, special event and tunnel/bridge entrances and exits. Using input from traffic and crowd management planners, it also bars certain critically important intersections from being closed down at any time, and other intersections from being closed down during morning and afternoon rush hours. <br>"These guidelines are a starting point, which give incident commanders more direction and balance when managing peaceful protests and ensure that public safety is maintained for all involved," Police Chief Scott Schubert said. <br>The Road Safety Guidelines policy is available in full [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/3367_PBP_Protest_Guidelines_July_2018.pdf). <br>Police will soon deploy crisis intervention teams to coordinate with protesters during demonstrations and promote open communication between organizers and police personnel. The specially-trained officers will seek to meet with protesters both before and after events to address concerns or issues that arise, in order to keep protesters safe and informed of police actions in support of First Amendment activity. <br>Police will also formally adopt de-escalation practices and tactics proven to reduce tension and enhance safety during demonstrations and other crowd activities. Public Safety personnel will work with community leaders and stakeholders to provide input into the policies before they are adopted. | 26/7/2018 16:13:46 |

That includes the FBI and (Pittsburgh) Public Safety. … He gets the job done and is well-respected. He will be a big loss.”<br>Mayor Peduto has named Ronald Romano acting EMS Chief. Romano, 61, of Stanton Heights, started working for Pittsburgh EMS on March 27, 1978.<br>The City of Pittsburgh thanks Chief Farrow for his four-plus decades of exemplary service. | 14/8/2018 15:19:19 |

Do not make checks payable to individuals.<br>“FBI Pittsburgh wants criminals who plan to exploit people’s pockets and generosity to know it won’t be tolerated,” said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Robert Jones. “We remain vigilant to the numerous types of scams that divert resources from genuine organizations helping the victims, even during times of crisis.”<br>You can report suspicious email solicitations or fraudulent websites to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at [www.ic3.gov](http://www.ic3.gov/) | 31/10/2018 14:10:57 |

One person was rescued from a second floor balcony. Meanwhile, Paramedics began assisting and evaluating residents on the scene. An 85-year-old woman suffered burns to her foot and was transported to the hospital in stable condition. A male resident was transported to the hospital for evaluation due to a pre-existing condition. He has since been released from the hospital. To provide immediate shelter for the elderly and those suffering from illnesses, Zone 2 officers escorted and assisted residents to their police station. Most of those residents are now with family members or back inside their apartments.  <br>Firefighters were quickly able to contain the fire to two apartments. Fire Chief Darryl Jones says, “Thankfully, this ten-story building had a working sprinkler system.” The sprinkler system was very instrumental in saving lives and preventing further damage to the high rise. Ebenezer Towers has ten floors and ninety-nine occupied apartments. The majority of the residents are seniors and many suffer from medical conditions.  <br>Residents on the upper floors were permitted back into their apartments after the building was deemed safe. The twenty-four people who lived on the first two floors were displaced primarily due to heavy smoke and water damage. The American Red Cross is currently assisting residents who could not return to their home. <br>In addition to the collaborative efforts of Public Safety personnel, Port Authority Transit and The Center for Family Excellence provided temporary shelter so evacuated residents did not have to brave the cold temperatures. The Salvation Army along with volunteers from the Center assisted residents and First Responders by providing food and beverages. During the evacuation, medics secured needed medications for those in need.  <br>The cause of the fire remains under investigation. | 18/11/2018 00:33:56 |

| Open House for New Northview Heights Public Safety Center | PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 3, 2018) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in collaboration with the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh and the Buhl Foundation’s One Northside Initiative, invite residents and the media to the grand opening of the Northview Heights Public Safety Center at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 4.<br>The new Public Safety Center -- which will serve residents of Northview Heights and Allegheny Dwellings -- is designed to improve quality of life for residents and to strengthen relationships between the community and the officers who serve them. Tomorrow’s Open House event will provide the public with a first glimpse inside the facility -- where residents will have access to job training, arts programs, and shared community space -- plus an opportunity to hear from City officials, community leaders and Northview Heights residents on their hopes for the Safety Center.<br>“This center is a great model of many different partners coming together for a common good, one that delivers equity and quality of life for all,” Mayor William Peduto said.<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich credited the many partners who came together on this project, including the Housing Authority and Executive Director Caster D. Binion.<br>“We worked closely on this important project, one which will result in improved police-community relations, more opportunities for residents and a safer environment for all,” Hissrich said. “We have seen great success with the opening of the Downtown substation, and we expect to replicate that success with the Northview Heights Public Safety Center.”<br>“We fully understand the value of working hand-in-hand with residents to build a better and safer community through collaboration, mutual respect and trust,” Police Chief Scott Schubert added. “This partnership in Northview Heights has the ability to make a significant difference in community-police relations, reduction of crime and disorder, and shared success in overall community wellness. It's our goal to replicate these partnerships and success stories in other communities.”<br>This Safety Center is in large part the result of the dedication and hard work of the Buhl Foundation, which decided several years ago to invest in Pittsburgh’s Northside neighborhoods. Through a series of surveys, public meetings, and face-to-face meetings with residents, Buhl and their partners asked the public how they would change and improve their neighborhoods. In doing so, they identified several common themes, which became the pillars of their One Northside Initiative: Place, Employment, Health, Education, and Safety.<br>“Both Northside residents and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officers indicated a desire to build safer communities by working together,” said Buhl Foundation President Diana Bucco. “I congratulate the City of Pittsburgh Housing Authority, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the Mayor’s Office for coming together in response to this need, and creating a space that is responsive to the community and a demonstration model that will truly have national implications.”<br>The new Safety Center was made possible through a substantial investment of Housing Authority dollars to create the state-of-the-art facility to focus on resident engagement and pro-active community safety. <br>"The Public Safety Center is a welcome addition to the Northview Heights community," said HACP Executive Director Caster D. Binion. "We are proud to partner with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, the Buhl Foundation and everyone who came together to develop a plan that puts resident safety and quality of life as the utmost priority. We expect the endeavor to produce an immediate, positive impact on the lives of the hundreds of Pittsburgh senior citizens and families who call Northview Heights home." <br>**SPEAKERS** (In order of appearance):<br>PBP Zone 1 Commander Christopher Ragland<br>Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich<br>Housing Authority Executive Director Caster Binion<br>PBP Chief Scott Schubert<br>The Buhl Foundation’s Amber Farr<br>PBP Sergeant Joseph Lewis<br>Tenant Council President Marcus Reed<br>Northview Heights Residents Olivia Bennett and Siraji Hassan.<br>**WHAT**: Grand opening of the Northview Heights Public Safety Center<br>**WHEN**: Tuesday, Dec. 4, 2018.

| Police to Conduct Live-Fire ShotSpotter Tests | PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 17, 2018) **-** On Dec. 18, 2018, at 7:30 p.m., the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will conduct a live-fire test of the ShotSpotter gunshot detection service, which was recently expanded to an 18-square mile coverage area.<br>Tests will occur in the following neighborhoods: Bedford Dwellings, Beltzhoover, Hazelwood, Homewood, Marshall-Shadeland, Perry, West End and Upper Hill. The purpose of the test is to verify all systems are operating as expected and guide any final adjustments before activating the service. The ShotSpotter service is not considered live and operational until the successful completion of the live-fire test.<br>Pittsburgh Police will be onsite at all test locations to ensure conditions for testing are safe. The controlled tests will consist of a sequence of gunshots fired at close range into a bullet trap. No bullets will be fired into the air and there is no danger to the public.<br>ShotSpotter uses a wide-area network of acoustic sensors to detect when a gun is fired, and then precisely and quickly pinpoints the location of the gunfire. In less than a minute, police officers and 911 dispatchers are notified of the fully-qualified and validated gunfire incidents, even if no one calls 911 – although the community is always encouraged to report sounds of gunfire.<br>By quickly notifying first responders of gunfire, ShotSpotter helps speed that response with precise information in order to save lives – much like a fire alarm. ShotSpotter is one of several cutting-edge technologies the City of Pittsburgh is employing to ensure the safety and security of our residents, visitors and surrounding communities.<br>“There are areas within the city that gunfire is so frequent and people don’t call 911,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “With ShotSpotter we have that instant alert to the police officers. They show up. They find individuals who have been injured. They may render first aid right away until the medics arrive, and we have saved lives.”<br>“Sometimes you’ll get a call that there’s shots fired, but you don’t know where it’s at in that area,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “Now it’s more specific where it’s at, how many rounds are being fired and, tactically for the officer approaching the scene, it’s safer.” | 14/12/2018 09:52:12 |
| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Release A Ten-Year Analysis On Ethnic Intimidation Incidents | FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>PITTSBURGH, PA (December 18, 2018) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police hosted a discussion of Ethnic Intimidation during the meeting of the FBI Greater Pittsburgh Civil Rights Working Group today. Pittsburgh Police Commander Eric Holmes serves as the Police Bureau’s liaison to the group and partnered with FBI Supervisory Special Agent Greg Heeb to coordinate this timely discussion. The Pittsburgh Police Crime Analysis Unit led by Dr. Heath Johnson, Crime Analyst Coordinator, released statistics and analysis on Ethnic Intimidation in the City of Pittsburgh.<br>Community leaders and representatives from the Greater Pittsburgh area received a ten-year analysis of Ethnic Intimidation incidents within the City of Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvania Crimes Code does not have specific “Hate Crime” charges but the term Ethnic Intimidation is used synonymously with the term Hate Crime.<br>The FBI defines Hate Crimes as “a criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.”<br>Under the Pennsylvania Ethnic Intimidation Crimes Code, sexual orientation is not covered. However; the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police tracks incidents involving sexual orientation.<br>Over a ten-year period, the City of Pittsburgh averaged 19 incidents per year and an average of eight violent Ethnic Intimidation incidents per year. The annual counts of incidents have remained steady over this ten-year period and are nearly evenly distributed throughout the neighborhoods.<br>City of Pittsburgh Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich said, “It is important for our residents to report potential crimes involving ethnic intimidation. The City of Pittsburgh Public Safety Department and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police take these reports very seriously because we want all residents to enjoy the quality of life that this city has to offer. Police will do everything possible to ensure those reporting incidents will be safe and protected.” The arrest rates for Ethnic Intimidation incidents average 40% with nearly 60% for violent incidents.<br>Other Key Findings:<br>\\* From January 1, 2008 to October 28, 2018 the distribution of Ethnic Intimidation Incidents are as follows: 76% of the incidents involved Race, 9% involved Ethnicity, 8% involved Religion, 6% involved Sexual Orientation, and 1% involved Disability.<br>\\* Racial animus is the most common contributor to Ethnic Intimidation charges, with the vast majority of those targeting African Americans.<br>“Any type of bias or Hate Crime is unacceptable and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is committed to thoroughly investigating and prosecuting anyone who violates the law. No one should ever have to live in a state of fear because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability,” Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert stated.<br>What can be done in the future to reduce the number of Ethnic Intimidation incidents in our area? To answer that question, today’s presenters shared current resources and discussed these key areas:<br>\\* The need to educate Law Enforcement and the community on recognizing Ethnic Intimidation.<br>\\* The need for more residents to report incidents of Ethnic Intimidation. If residents see an incident, report the incident.<br>\\* Enhance the public’s awareness of the issue and inform residents of the incidents.<br>\\* Enhance community involvement with awareness and education programs.<br>Police Chief Schubert added, “It is our hope that by continually sharing data with the public, we can draw more attention to the problem and work with the community to ensure violations are reported and investigated. By working together, we can prevent future occurrences of bias and hate. We owe it to everyone who lives, works or visits our beautiful city.”<br>Pittsburgh is STRONGER THAN HATE<br>For more:  Facebook.com/PittsburghPolice | 18/12/2018 15:04:24 |

| Mayor, Public Safety, Police Discuss 2018 Crime Stats | PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 14, 2019) -- City, Public Safety and Police Bureau officials gathered this morning in the Mayor’s Conference Room to discuss the final 2018 statistics for homicides, investigation clearance rates and shootings.<br>Over the past several years, homicides and shootings have trended downwards in the city of Pittsburgh. That trend continued in 2018.<br>But officials warned that although the numbers represent progress, work remains.<br>"Every year since 2014, we have seen a decrease in the number of homicides that have occurred in this city. That includes last year," Mayor William Peduto said. "Our clearance rate has also increased, dramatically, and that is completely due to the work of Police. ... However, that’s still not good enough. Our goal is to eradicate gun violence in our city.”<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich credited the improving numbers on increased community engagement, the use of technology including security cameras and ShotSpotter, and the hard work of police officers, among other factors.<br>“Some of the accomplishments have to do with the staffing of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,” Director Hissrich said. “Thanks to the Mayor and City Council, our staffing levels have increased dramatically over the last several years allowing more officers to be on the street. (When) the public sees the same officers day to day, we have more of an open dialogue. Without the community, these numbers would be drastically higher. Next year we hope to see the continued downward trend of these numbers. But that will only be done through the help of the community, technology and most importantly the work of Pittsburgh Police.”<br>There were 71 homicides in 2014. The total dropped to 60 in 2015, 59 in 2016, 58 in 2017 and 55 in 2018.<br>There were 174 non-fatal shootings in 2015, when Police began creating the Group Violence Intervention (GVI) Unit, which targets at-risk members of the community and offers guidance and services to escape a life of violence and crime. The number rose to 188 in 2016, then dropped to 140 in 2017 and 114 in 2018.<br>Clearance rates hovered in the 50-percent range from 2014 to 2017, but improved to 71 percent in 2018.<br>Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Chief Scott Schubert praised his officers, who take every homicide personally. He also credited residents for their willingness to work with Police, and said officers would continue to focus on removing illegal firearms from the streets.<br>“One homicide is too many in the city of Pittsburgh, and we need to think about the victims’ families and what they go through when someone is murdered,” Schubert said. “Our job is not done.

Detectives checked Missing Persons reports and found no matches.<br>Det. Fallert conferred with retired Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Assistant Chief Therese Rocco, who had headed the bureau’s Missing Person’s Division for many years before her retirement in 1994. Assistant Chief Rocco was unable to identify the victim from police reports. However, while reviewing former owners and occupants of the residence, Rocco remembered Mary and Albert Arcuri, who were Rocco’s former neighbors and friends more than 50 years ago. She recalled that in the mid-1960s, the story was that Mary had left Albert and was never seen or heard from again. No Missing Person report was filed and police were not notified. <br>Through further investigation, detectives learned that Albert and Mary Arcuri purchased the residence in the early 1960s, and that in the fall of 1964, Albert told family members that Mary had left him.

Less than a year later (May, 1965), Albert Arcuri died when the car he was driving crashed into a building on Baum Boulevard, which was then the Don Allen Chevrolet car dealership.<br>Investigators obtained a DNA sample from a living family member. The remains and the sample were sent to UNT Center for Human Identification in Texas for analysis.<br>A forensic analyst from the lab last week confirmed that the remains are those of Mary Arcuri.<br>The investigation is ongoing.

| National Drug Take Back Day | ALERT: Saturday is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5677_DEA_takeback_banner.jpg)<br>(Pittsburgh, Pa) April 24, 2019 –<br>The opioid drug crisis continues to ravage communities around the country and across the commonwealth. Six million Americans misuse controlled prescription drugs, according to the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.<br>This Saturday, April 27, Pittsburghers have an opportunity to protect their communities and help diminish prescription drug abuse.<br>From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., all six Pittsburgh Police Zones, Phillips Rec Center in Carrick, and other locations around the city, will be accepting expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs for safe disposal as part of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 17th National Take-Back Initiative.<br>“We as a community need to do our part to help prevent drug addiction and overdoses. This day allows us to participate in the prevention,” said Pittsburgh Police Sergeant Rebecca Bassano.<br>The federal Drug Enforcement Administration holds two Drug Take Back events each year. During the October event in Pittsburgh last year, police collected 318 pounds of drugs.<br>Nationally, nearly 4,800 law enforcement partners participated in the event last fall, collecting a record 914, 236 pounds -- or 457 tons – of unused or unwanted prescription drugs.<br>This initiative addresses a vital public safety and public health issue.

| Police Announce Nine Arrests in Violent 2014 Spree | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 2, 2019) -- A years-long investigation of gang activity in the city’s southern neighborhoods has resulted in multiple Grand Jury indictments and nine arrests — including the arrests of four people who are charged in the 2014 murder of Omar Hodges, a City of Pittsburgh refuse worker.<br>The arrests clear multiple cases and dismantle the leadership of organized criminal groups that waged a violent war on the streets of Pittsburgh in October, 2014.<br>\-\- On Oct. 11, 2014, three people were shot and wounded on the 3100 block of Cordell Place.<br>\-\- On Oct. 12, 2014, one man was shot on the 3000 block of Arlington Avenue.<br>\-\- On Oct. 13, 2014, Omar Hodges, 29, was fatally shot while sitting in his car on the 1300 block of Birmingham Avenue shortly before beginning his shift as a refuse collector.<br>\-\- On Oct. 20, 2014, a male was kidnapped and tortured.<br>The investigation connects additional crimes to the groups, including a Dec. 22, 2014 shooting of a man on Allen Street.<br>Police investigated the violence from the start, at which time they determined that federal investigators were conducting a drug trafficking investigation of these groups.<br>In 2016, Pittsburgh Violent Crimes Detectives (including Joseph Fabus, Garrett Spory and Edward Fallert) and Narcotics Detective Eric Harpster took over the investigation. <br>Through their diligence and hard work, they connected the shootings and kidnapping to the federal drug investigation and obtained new evidence and witnesses. In 2018, a Grand Jury convened. The Grand Jury was necessary for several reasons, including to assure the protection of key witnesses from ongoing retaliatory violence.<br>In January, 2019, the Grand Jury returned indictments on nine people in connection to the violence from October, 2014. Police have now arrested all nine suspects:<br>**Gemere Bey, 29, of Beltzhoover is charged with aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, terroristic threats and recklessly endangering another person.**<br>**![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5740_pastedImage_(8).png)**<br>**Christopher Bradley-Bey, 25, of Beltzhoover is charged with aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, terroristic threats and recklessly endangering another person.**<br>**![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5741_pastedImage_(9).png)**<br>**Holman Brown, 27, of Beltzhoover is charged with homicide, criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, carrying a firearm without a license, terroristic threats and reckless endangerment of another person.**<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5737_pastedImage_(5).png)<br>**Christopher Brown, 26, of Beltzhoover is charged with homicide, aggravated assault, and criminal conspiracy.**<br>**![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5736_pastedImage_(4).png)**<br>**Corey Cheatom, 27, of Beltzhoover is charged  with homicide, attempted homicide, aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, tampering with evidence, and other charges.**<br>**![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5734_pastedImage_(2).png)**<br>**Sheraun Davis, 35, of McKees Rocks is charged with attempted homicide, criminal conspiracy and aggravated assault.**<br>**![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5738_pastedImage_(6).png)**<br>**Shakeem Davis, 28, of McKees Rocks is charged with attempted homicide, criminal conspiracy and aggravated assault.**<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5739_pastedImage_(7).png)<br>**Cody Duncan, 27, of Beltzhoover is charged with aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy.**<br>**![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5735_pastedImage_(3).png)**<br>**Lance Gardenhire, 43, of Beltzhoover is charged with homicide, aggravated assault and solicitation.**<br>**![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/5733_pastedImage_(1).png)**<br>Detectives relied on video evidence, ballistic evidence, cell phone analysis and social media analysis as part of the investigation. In addition, multiple witness statements were obtained by PBP detectives in locations across the country.<br>The investigation revealed that the two violent groups -- “Zhoove” from Beltzhoover and “Darccide” from St. Clair Village -- engaged in an all-out turf war that included gang members placing bounties of up to $20,000 on the heads of rival gang leaders.<br>Omar Hodges was a victim of this senseless battle. He had no gang affiliation. He was an innocent, hard-working man who was killed while sitting in his car and waiting to go to work simply because his car resembled the vehicle of a high-ranking gang leader.<br>Four of the suspects arrested -- Lance Gardenhire, Chris Brown, Holman Brown and Corey Cheatom -- have been charged with homicide in Hodges’ death.<br>These arrests illustrate that Pittsburgh Police do not rest on open investigations. Years may pass. But detectives continue to question and push for answers. The results of this investigation come from excellent collaboration between Homicide detectives, Narcotics detectives, the Intelligence Unit and Zone 3 detectives.<br>This investigation also shows the importance of investigators receiving help from the public. When witnesses come forward, we solve crimes. Thanks to the cooperation of the public, nine dangerous people are in custody and facing significant prison sentences.<br>Many agencies played a hand in this investigation, including: The Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, The US Attorneys Office, The Allegheny County Crime Lab. | 2/5/2019 10:25:19 |

Remember to treat them with respect, with compassion, because they might be dealing with something where they need advice, they need to talk. There’s nothing better than someone who stays there and listens to them.”<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he was consistently impressed with the officers’ level of devotion and dedication to the city, their integrity and their selfless desire to aid our communities.<br>“They do this each and every day, often at the expense of time spent with their loved ones. I’d also like to thank the friends and families for their sacrifice, day in and day out, for understanding the role these officers play in protecting the city that we all love.”<br>Mayor William Peduto swore in the newly-promoted sergeants.<br>“A sergeant is somebody who is gone to in a crisis, in the moment when an incident is happening and the officers look to the sergeant to make that decisive call. But it’s not only in those crisis moments that your leadership will be needed. Your leadership will be needed every day...every day you wear that uniform. For you wear the uniform for all of those who have worn it before and everyone who will wear it after.”<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6304_file3-4.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6305_file1-8_(1).jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6307_file4-4_(1).jpeg) | 24/6/2019 15:16:26 |

| Fourth of July Security Announcement | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2019) – Pittsburgh Public Safety and several partner law enforcement agencies will be out in force Thursday to ensure a safe experience for all during Fourth of July celebrations.<br>As usual, Public Safety expects large numbers of people to congregate at various locations, including the North Shore, Downtown, Mt. Washington and Point State Park.<br>Although certain consumer fireworks were legalized last year, fireworks are a fire hazard and pose significant dangers to humans. As a reminder, fireworks are not allowed in Point State Park. In addition, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of any structure.<br>Police will arrest and/or cite anyone caught illegally setting off fireworks.<br>"The Fourth of July is a great American tradition and a great Pittsburgh tradition, but we want and expect people to celebrate responsibly,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “As in past years, there will be zero-tolerance for any type of disorderly conduct, to include illegal use of fireworks, fighting, public intoxication, underage drinking, or any type of violence.”<br>Other prohibited items in the park include, but are not limited to: Alcohol, drones, grills, laser pointers, weapons, explosives or ammunition. Open carry is not permitted. Law enforcement will establish security checks inside the park to screen bags for prohibited items.<br>State, County and City Mounted Units will be present; River Rescue, Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and the Coast Guard will be on the city’s three rivers to enforce laws.<br>Pittsburgh EMS, State Park Rangers and multiple partner agencies, including Allegheny County Police, the County Sheriff’s Office, State Police, Port Authority Police and Juvenile Probation will team up to assure a safe experience for all.<br>Temperatures are expected to be warm and humid. Please limit alcohol intake and drink plenty of water.<br>Do not drink and drive. Patrols will be out searching for and arresting impaired drivers.<br>Remember your pets: Many dogs are panicked by fireworks and will jump fences when they begin. In the days leading up to the Fourth of July, Animal Care & Control officers respond to an average of 10 loose dogs a day. Please keep them in a safe place.<br>In addition, Public Safety reminds residents that celebratory gunfire remains a problem in many cities, particularly on the Fourth of July and New Year’s Eve. Any bullet discharged from a gun into the air must land somewhere, and when it does there is significant risk of injury or death. Pittsburgh Police in all six zones will respond to ShotSpotter activations and arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public.<br>Lastly, regarding fireworks, Public Safety officials and UPMC gave a demonstration last year on the dangers of fireworks, even those that are now legal. A video of that event and more information can be found here:<br>[http://inside.upmc.com/fireworks\_safety/](http://inside.upmc.com/fireworks_safety/)<br>Public Safety wishes all a happy and safe Fourth of July. | 1/7/2019 15:20:08 |

| Public Safety Urges Pittsburgh Residents to Take Precautions Ahead of Heat Wave | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 18, 2019) The City of Pittsburgh will be under a heat advisory from noon on Friday until 8 p.m. Saturday evening. The National Weather Service is predicting high temperatures and humidity that could push the heat index to between 100 and 105 degrees.<br>In anticipation of the extreme conditions, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Chief Ron Romano, Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones, Parks and Recreation Director Ross Chapman, and the Chairman of UPMC’s Emergency Medicine Department Dr. Donald Yealy held a news conference to provide information on how residents can safely beat the heat while protecting children, the elderly, and pets.<br>“We have not had a heat event like this in several years,” said Public Safety Director Hissrich. He added, “We will aggressively prosecute (for) animals that are left in vehicles, dogs, cats and certainly if we have a child left in a vehicle, that will be aggressively prosecuted as well.” Hissrich encouraged people to check on their elderly neighbors throughout the day, especially in the afternoon when temperatures peak.<br>UPMC's Dr. Donald Yealy outlined some of the early warning signs of heat stress such as, “not feeling quite right,” upset stomach or feeling a little sweaty.<br>“The later findings like difficulty breathing, passing out and maybe even suffering cardiac arrest, nobody has a problem identifying that, the goal is to never get to that point,” said Yealy. “Don’t ignore the early signals. The late ones are bad.”<br>EMS Chief Romano urged city residents to drink plenty of fluids and stay in the house if they can, especially those with underlying medical conditions. He also reminded people that medics are always at the ready and to never hesitate to call 911 in the event of an emergency.<br>“Certainly we’ll be available, we’ll probably be busier, but we’ll get there as soon as we can,” said Romano.<br>Fire Chief Jones warned about a seemingly fun, but potentially dangerous way to cool down, by opening neighborhood fire hydrants. “We do not have a water shortage now, but if everyone decides to crack one open, then we can quickly have one,” said Jones.<br>The City’s Parks and Recreation Director Ross Chapman suggested a better option would be checking out some of the city’s 18 public pools, eight spray parks and three cooling centers, the latter of which will have extended hours through the weekend.<br>For more information on the locations and hours for the city’s cooling centers, pools, and spray parks:<br>[https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=3133](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=3133)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6558_file-23.jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6557_file1-11.jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6555_file3-5.jpeg) | 19/7/2019 07:06:08 |

However, traffic will likely be most affected in Oakland around Soldiers and Sailors.<br>In addition, Pennsylvania State Police is informing commuters that road and bridge closures will be in place starting Tuesday, July 23 at 9:30 a.m. while law enforcement begins its procession to Soldiers and Sailors. Due to the road closures, the INBOUND HOV lanes will be open with no occupancy restrictions for commuting traffic throughout the morning.<br>PSP and PennDOT ask commuters to avoid these areas for the morning hours if at all possible and use alternate routes. | 22/7/2019 13:00:31 |

That night we wanted to give blood, but obviously we couldn’t. But one of the things the hospital said was, ‘You can give blood, you can help make a difference with other people,’ That’s how Calvin lived and that’s how we want to live in his legacy and help save other lives,” said Schubert.<br>Beginning August 1 through August 31, members of the public can also donate blood in Calvin Hall’s honor at any location simply by mentioning his name to Vitalant staff or by using a special group code: Z0021100.<br>Schedule your blood donation at a Vitalant community blood drive or donation center during the month of August.<br>To find a location near you, call (412) 209-7000 or visit vitalant.org/officerhall.<br>Visit our Facebook event: https://bit.ly/2GGf1TP<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6685_67485411_2358038091101695_2286728343162191872_o.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6684_67717311_2358038584434979_3507879839967215616_o.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6686_68302864_2358038481101656_7241732130013708288_o.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6687_67639903_2358038377768333_1165566438082084864_o.jpg) | 31/7/2019 18:23:54 |

All of the overdose victims wore orange wristbands.<br>At some point in the evening, Sanchez-Montalvo left Insomnia and went to the South Side apartment, where he had been staying. Several other individuals who were at Insomnia, including members of the band that played at the bar on Saturday night, joined him for what was described as an "after-party."<br>Sanchez-Montalvo distributed a white powdered substance, believed to be cocaine, to those in attendance.

| Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Awarded Fire Prevention Safety Funding to Serve the Deaf and Hard of Hearing | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 27, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire is pleased to announce it has been awarded more than $1 million in federal and civic funding to help equip the deaf and hard of hearing with life-saving smoke and fire detection devices for their homes.<br>FEMA will provide more than $950,000 through its Fire Prevention Safety Grants, while the City of Pittsburgh will contribute close to $50,000 for the two-year program.<br>The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire will work closely with the Center for Hearing and Deaf Services in Pittsburgh to identify local recipients who will receive the devices and learn how to use them.<br>The specialized smoke and fire detectors will vary depending on individual needs. Some of the devices work in conjunction with audible smoke detectors to activate visual cues such as strobe lights. Others can be worn on the body as pager-type monitors that vibrate and alert people wherever they may be in the home.<br>Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones says the funding will go a long way toward protecting a population that is underserved when it comes to fire safety.<br>“The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) states people who are deaf or are hard of hearing face unique challenges in an emergency. Their ability to detect a fire or escape its effects can be hindered.<br>As a result, they are at a greater risk of death or injury due to fire. The most pressing fire safety issue for people who are deaf or hard of hearing is whether they will be alerted to danger in time to escape. These specially-designed devices are expensive to buy and install in a home - much more so than the standard smoke detectors you'd find at a hardware store. Those who are deaf or hard of hearing should not be prevented from protecting themselves and their families in the event of a fire simply because it is cost-prohibitive,” said Jones.<br>Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Inspector / Fire Prevention Officer Lisa Epps will lead the training programs to teach recipients how to operate the safety equipment and install it in their homes.<br>An announcement on the start date and eligibility for the program will be made at a later time. | 26/9/2019 15:33:07 |
| Police Launch "Scentsational" Tracking Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (Sept. 27, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in conjunction with Allegheny General Hospital and FBI Pittsburgh, today announced the launch of the Scentsational Tracking Program featuring the Police Bloodhound.<br>The goal of the program is to create a safety net for those who might get lost and have trouble finding their way home.<br>PBP and Allegheny General Hospital will assist residents in collecting and packaging the scent of a loved one in a sterile container. The family maintains the scent container, which is usable for seven years. Should a loved one go missing, the family gives the sealed scent container to Police for the Bloodhound to track.<br>“The Bloodhound’s skills are honed to a point where it can differentiate between identical twins,” said Police Lt. Charles Henderson, who oversees the tracking program. “Where this is going to be most beneficial is with our most vulnerable communities, people who have cognitive disabilities and are prone to being lost. But we’ll do this for anyone who wants it.”<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich noted that the Bloodhound will be available to other communities in western Pennsylvania.<br>“Whether it’s a senior citizen or a child, we’ll be able to work with our partners in the FBI and find the missing child or adult,” Hissrich said. “And we will share that asset with everyone who wants to use it. All of our assets -- whether it be the explosives dogs, drugs dogs, the fireboat -- whatever we have will respond outside the city, which we do almost every day.”<br>The Scentsational Tracking Program officially launched today at Point State Park where the Bureau’s current Bloodhound, Cappy, and his handler, Officer Kevin Merkel, gave a demonstration by tracking a Public Safety employee.<br>“You just saw firsthand how important these dogs will be to investigations across our area,” said FBI Pittsburgh Supervisory Special Agent Scott Argiro. “We have a long-standing partnership with the Pittsburgh Police special ops team and have worked many of these cases side by side. These dogs are one more incredible tool we add to our tool box. Their specialized training allows them to help all of us find a scent and a lead to follow very early on. When every minute counts, those leads are crucial.”<br>Allegheny General Hospital donated the containers and equipment, meaning the program is free to all who wish to participate.<br>How to get involved: Police will host community outreach events at which the containers will be provided. In addition, Allegheny General Hospital will collect scents at regular appointments. Lastly, residents can call their local Police Zone and ask for a Community Resource Officer or Neighborhood Resource Officer for more information.<br>Additional Background: Bloodhounds are one of the top canine breeds for scent discrimination. They search for skin cells that have fallen from their target. The bloodhound can differentiate the odor of the target from other people.<br>Storing the scent correctly is an important part of the program. The scent is collected and packaged according to the best practices outlined by the FBI. It is best stored in a refrigerator. If that is not feasible, then storing the sample at a temperate less than 76 degrees Fahrenheit and at a humidity level less than 60 percent will be the next best option. Not breaking the seal of the container until needed will ensure that the scent is not contaminated. | 27/9/2019 15:19:14 |
| Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Receives American Heart Association Elite Status Award | PITTSBURGH, PA, (September 30, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS was honored today with the American Heart Association’s 2019 Mission: Lifeline EMS Gold Plus Performance Achievement Award.<br>The honor recognizes the critical life-saving role of EMS in providing care to patients suffering from an acute myocardial infarction, or a heart attack.<br>“The City of Pittsburgh EMS is driving improvements in the care and outcomes of the residents of the City of Pittsburgh.” said the American Heart Association’s Gina Hrach, Director of Quality Systems Improvement.<br>Hrach presented the award to Pittsburgh EMS Chief Ron Romano, who received it on behalf of the Bureau. Romano thanked all EMS personnel for all of their hard work and dedication that made the award possible.<br>Assistant Chief Mark Pinchalk thanked all EMS partners for helping them meet a difficult metric.<br>“We see approximately 60 patients per year having a STEMI - or ST Elevation MI – where the goal is from the time we get a paramedic on scene, until they are in the cardiac catheterization lab, and their vessels open and their heartbeat’s reprofused is less than 90 minutes. We were able to achieve that metric in about 80 per cent of our cases for 2018 and our average time is around 80 minutes. So, that’s a pretty good metric we’re able to pull off with the resources we have available to us,” said Pinchalk.<br>City of Pittsburgh Medical Director Dr. Ron Roth provided a different measure to highlight EMS skills in Pittsburgh. He recounted the story of a participant in last year’s Great Race where a runner went into cardiac arrest near the finish line, but was revived by paramedics and doctors. This year he ran the 10 K race with his family and thanked Pittsburgh EMS for the ability to do so.<br>“We saw him not as a percentage or a number. We saw him as a father, a husband, and he introduced his little grand baby. And I think we saw what we get from being very vigilant and all the hard work our city medics do. ” said Roth.<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich echoed those sentiments.<br>“You have the statistics, but to each statistic there’s a human life involved, whether it’s a father, mother, son, daughter, it’s important to the individual, whether or not they’re a resident, whether they’re a visitor to the city of Pittsburgh,” said Hissrich, congratulating paramedics and EMT’s on the award.<br>Mayor William Peduto commended Pittsburgh EMS and hospitals for working hand-in-hand to provide critical care in the City of Pittsburgh.<br>“While you’re here, whether you’re a resident or a visitor, you will be given the best care possible,” said Peduto.<br>This is the second year in a row the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS has received this elite status award from the American Heart Association.<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7196_file-3.jpeg) | 30/9/2019 16:31:13 |

Lawrence Convention Center, where the President will speak at the Shale Insight conference, will be closed that day after the morning rush hour. The closures will likely impact the evening commute.<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich cautions that traffic will be a major concern.<br>“As with any high profile event, Pittsburgh Public Safety and our partner law enforcement agencies are taking every step to address all safety concerns,” Hissrich said. “However, we can certainly use the public’s help. Traffic Downtown and around the Convention Center will be bad. I urge anyone who can avoid the area to do so.”<br>Hissrich recommends that people who work Downtown consider working from home Wednesday or leaving early. He suggests Downtown schools allow early dismissal for students.<br>Traffic will also be affected by rolling road closures to accommodate the President’s motorcade as he travels to and from the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.<br>Public Safety will continue to prepare through the weekend and into next week.

| National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is Saturday, October 26, 2019 | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7390_DEA_TakeBack2018_DigitalBillboard_1400x400_Eng_0.jpg)<br>PITTSBURGH, PA, (October 22, 2019) – Communities around the country and across the Commonwealth continue to struggle with escalating drug addiction, some of which begins with easily-accessible prescription drugs.<br>In fact, nearly 10 million Americans have misused controlled prescription drugs, according to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. That’s an increase of nearly 4 million from the previous year’s survey.<br>**From 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Saturday, October 26**, Pittsburgh will have the opportunity, for the second time this year, to participate in the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 18th National Prescription Drug Take Back Day in an effort to diminish devastating drug abuse in our communities.<br>In April, nearly 420 pounds of expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs were collected for safe disposal at all six Pittsburgh Police zone stations, Police Headquarters, and the Phillips Rec Center in Carrick. <br>Nationally, nearly 5,000 law enforcement partners participated in the April initiative, collecting close to 470 tons of unused or unwanted prescription drugs.<br>"By dropping off unneeded pill bottles and prescription drugs for safe disposal you're ensuring that those drugs, which may seem harmless when used for their intended purpose, don't fall into the wrong hands," said Sergeant Rebecca Bassano, Pittsburgh Police Narcotics and Vice . <br>This initiative addresses a vital public safety and public health issue. Medicines forgotten or left behind in the home are highly susceptible to misuse and abuse. Studies show that the majority of misused and abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, including from the home medicine cabinet. In addition, Americans are advised that disposing of unused medicines by flushing them down the toilet or throwing them in the trash, poses potential safety and health hazards. <br>All expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs can be dropped off at the following locations this Saturday:<br>Zone 1: 1501 Brighton Rd, 15212<br>Zone 2: 2000 Centre Ave, 15219<br>Zone 3: 830 E Warrington Ave, 15210<br>Zone 4: 5858 Northumberland St, 15217<br>Zone 5: 1401 Washington Blvd, 15206<br>Zone 6: 312 South Main St, 15220<br>Phillips Rec Center: 201 Parkfield St, 15210<br>Police Headquarters: 1203 Western Ave, 15233<br>For those who can’t participate this weekend, permanent drop-off boxes are located at Pittsburgh Police Headquarters and Zone 6.<br>For more information about the safe disposal of prescription drugs or about the October 26th Take Back Day event, visit [www.DEATakeBack.com](http://www.deatakeback.com/). | 18/10/2019 11:38:27 |
| Public Safety Update on Officers Injured at Tree at Life | PITTSBURGH, PA (Oct. 24, 2019) – This Sunday will mark one year since the tragic events at the Tree of Life synagogue, in which 11 members of Tree of Life, New Light and Dor Hadash congregations were killed and several others were injured.<br>We recognize the significance of the upcoming weekend, and wish to assure everyone attending events or services that Public Safety will be there and that security plans are in place. Pittsburgh Public Safety and our partner law enforcement agencies will work together to ensure that everyone attending events this weekend will be safe.<br>Many people have expressed interest in hearing from the Pittsburgh Police officers who were injured by gunfire in the synagogue attack. For various reasons, the time is not right for the officers to speak publicly about what they experienced that day.<br>However, Public Safety would like to provide an update on the officers, including written statements from the three officers who remain off the job as they recover from their serious injuries.<br>Officers Michael Smidga (shrapnel wound to the head), John Persin (hearing concerns/issues), and Tyler Pashel (knee Injury) have all recovered and are back on the job.<br>Zone 4 Officer Dan Mead and SWAT Officers Anthony Burke and Timothy Matson continue to recover from their wounds and have not returned to work.<br>All hope to return soon and rejoin their brother and sister officers.<br>They also wish to express their gratitude to the public for their prayers and concern.<br>= From Officer Dan Mead, who suffered a gunshot wound to the hand:<br>“There’s no reason why I should still be living, but I am and I want to thank everyone for everything they did and continue to do to support me.<br>“I want to thank the Jewish Community, my family including my sister Diane and my girlfriend Lisa, Pittsburgh Police and all the other police departments, the firemen, the medics, the doctors -- everybody. It was a huge team effort and I want to thank everybody for helping me.<br>“The Jewish Community’s support and the ways they have shown their appreciation -- I’m not used to that. As a carpenter, I would do a job and you’d say, ‘Hey, nice job,’ and I’d leave and go do the next job. But they have been so appreciative, and it’s overwhelming. They’re saying thank you, but I need to say thank you to them.<br>“My father was on this job and I looked up to him and that’s why I signed up to be a police officer. I tried for this job. I wasn’t drafted into it. These poor people that lost their lives and their families, they didn’t sign up for that. Not a day goes by that I don’t say my prayers for these people. I feel for them.<br>“I was an officer in the wrong place at the right time. I was never one of these super cops, but when it’s time to take care of business, you take care of business. That’s what we signed up for and that’s what we did.”<br>= From Officer Anthony Burke, who suffered a gunshot wound to the hand:<br>“To all those who helped support my fiancée and me over this time of healing, you have my utmost gratitude.<br>“I would be remiss if I didn't specifically thank the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh for their enormous and unparalleled support, without which the burden of everyday life would be unbearable. I sincerely cannot thank you enough.<br>“To the Pittsburgh community and the people who volunteered, donated, and supported my recovery, all I can say is: Yinz are the best.<br>“To my coworkers and their families, my brothers and sisters in blue in Pittsburgh and from around the country, thank you for watching my six, and thank you for taking care of Sam and me. I can't wait until I'm back in service running calls alongside you.<br>“While my period of healing is coming to an end, there are 11 families who continue to grieve and heal. Please direct your continued support towards them during this tragic weekend and going forward.”<br>= From Officer Timothy Matson, who suffered multiple gunshot wounds:<br>“I would like to thank the community, my friends, family and coworkers, and people from across the world for their support. The support I received was incredible. I have never experienced anything like it. In more ways than I can express, your support helped me through the toughest time of my life.<br>“I would like to thank the UPMC staff that took care of me. After the lengthy stay and multiple surgeries the list of people to thank is long, but I would like you all to know that the lengths you went to put me back together and take care of my needs will never be forgotten.<br>“I would also like thank my Pittsburgh SWAT teammates. Your actions that day are why I’m here.”<br>On behalf of the officers, Public Safety would like to thank the media for your continued sensitivity in providing the injured officers and their families space and privacy while they recover from their wounds.<br>During this solemn weekend, Public Safety officials will not conduct interviews or make public comments so as to ensure that the focus remains on the victims, their families and the Jewish community.<br>Please keep the victims and their families in your prayers this weekend. | 24/10/2019 13:47:02 |

| Tips for Drivers and Trick-or Treaters to See and Be Seen This Halloween | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 30, 2019) – Public Safety is urging trick-or-treaters to stay safe in the city this Halloween.<br>The weather forecast is less-than-ideal during the City of Pittsburgh’s established trick-or-treating hours of 5:30 until 7:30 p.m. Temperatures are expected to drop from a high of 68 degrees during the day, down to the low 50’s during trick-or treat hours, with a wind chill that will make it feel much colder. There is also significant rainfall in the forecast during that time.<br>Public Safety suggests that parents ensure their children’s costumes are reflective, light in color, and that any masks or makeup provide full visibility for crossing streets. Adding small clip-on lights to the front and back of a costume can also provide another measure of visibility.<br>Although some children may not want toadd gloves, hats, or water-resistant jackets and footwear to their super hero or princess costumes, this may be essential to enjoying the night comfortably.<br>According to statistics from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Collision Investigation Unit, there has not been a fatal collision and there have not been any documented police reports of children struck by vehicles on Halloween night over the past five years in Pittsburgh. That’s good news. However, in that same five-year time period, there have been 33 pedestrian/vehicle collisions in the month of October when it gets darker earlier in the evening.<br>Public Safety would like to remind drivers to slow down during trick-or-treat hours, even more so during inclement weather, and for parents to assist children crossing the street during that time to ensure a safe and enjoyable Halloween. | 30/10/2019 13:18:04 |
| Northview Heights Substation Renamed After Fallen Officer | PITTSBURGH, PA (Oct. 30, 2019) -- The Northview Heights Public Safety Center has been renamed after late Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officer Calvin Hall.<br>Officer Hall strove always to connect with the communities he served, and he started each shift with the words: “Time for me to make a difference.”<br>Those words now grace the building where Officer Hall worked until his final roll call in July. Two plaques were unveiled during a ceremony on Sunday, which would have been Officer Hall’s 37th birthday.<br>“We are here today to celebrate the life of Calvin Hall, and also to dedicate a building where he worked,” said Pittsburgh Police Sgt. Joe Lewis, who leads the Officer Calvin M. Hall Public Safety Center. “He made a difference in multiple people’s lives, including mine and including every person who’s standing here now.”<br>About 100 people attended the ceremony, including city leaders, Police Command Staff, Northview Heights residents, Zone 1 Commander Christopher Ragland and Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich.<br>“Working this substation requires a hands-on, community-focused approach as this a neighborhood that has been underserved for years,” Hissrich said. “But it’s exactly where Officer Hall wanted to be. He dedicated himself to building bridges. He truly did make a difference.”<br>Mayor William Peduto noted that the community lost an exemplary officer far too early.<br>“Calvin Hall dedicated his life to public safety, and I hope a lot of the young ones here today will consider doing the same,” Mayor Peduto said.<br>The safety center officially opened on Dec. 4, 2018. Created in collaboration with the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh and the Buhl Foundation’s One Northside Initiative, the safety center serves residents of Northview Heights and Allegheny Dwellings. It is designed to improve quality of life for residents and to strengthen relationships between the community and the officers who serve them.<br>It is fitting that the building is now named after Officer Hall, who specifically requested an assignment at the substation because of his passion for community police work.<br>“He left an indelible mark on his brother and sister officers, as well as the community he served,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “He was known for his quick smile, ever-optimistic attitude and for his career-long focus on community policing. He was a model officer. He made it a priority to connect with residents, and succeeded in doing so."<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7496_Hall1.png)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7498_Hall2.png)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7497_Hall3.png) | 30/10/2019 13:39:55 |

You will become role models for young children and the foundation of our communities," said Director Hissrich.<br>Before delivering the oath of office, Mayor Peduto told the graduating class what it truly means to be a Pittsburgh Police officer.<br>"It requires honor and integrity because you don't wear the uniform for you. You wear that uniform and that badge for everybody who wore it before you and everybody who will wear it after. There's a long, proud tradition within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police."<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7680_file1.jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7681_file3.jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7682_file2.jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7683_file6.jpeg) | 14/11/2019 13:35:40 |
| Light Up Night: Public Safety Prepares for Large Crowds | PITTSBURGH, PA (Nov. 18, 2019) – With Light Up Night festivities planned for Friday, Nov. 22, Public Safety is preparing for large crowds at venues throughout the Downtown area.<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich welcomes residents and visitors to the events that mark the start of the holiday season in Pittsburgh.<br>“As a native of this region, I am very much aware that Light Up Night is a wonderful Pittsburgh tradition that is especially popular with families,” Director Hissrich said. “As Public Safety Director, I can assure everyone planning on attending that we have taken steps to make this a safe experience for all.”<br>As with other large events Downtown and elsewhere in the city, a significant police presence will help maintain safety, Hissrich said.<br>Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office, Allegheny County Police, Pennsylvania State Police, Port Authority Police and State Park Rangers -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout the venues. Mounted Units from the city, county and state will be present, as will River Rescue and the Fire Boat, Pittsburgh EMS, Pittsburgh Fire and Emergency Management. Public Safety will also utilize SkyWatch, which provides officers with a bird’s-eye view of crowds.<br>“We will have a zero-tolerance policy for anyone who chooses not to be law-abiding,” Hissrich said. “That means no disorderly conduct, no fighting, no public intoxication or underage drinking, and no type of violence will be tolerated.”<br>The weather will be seasonable with forecasted temperatures in the 40s and a possible shower.<br>Traffic, as always, will be a concern. Attendees are urged to be patient and to use public transportation.<br>Police remind the public that drones are not allowed, nor are illegal weapons. In addition, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure.<br>Public Safety wishes all a happy and safe holiday season. | 18/11/2019 14:23:47 |
| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Promotes Officer to Sergeant | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 3, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police held a promotions ceremony Tuesday afternoon in the Mayor’s Conference Room where Officer Phil Lerza was promoted to the rank of sergeant.<br>Having spent the last decade working with the K-9 Unit, Sergeant Lerza will celebrate his 19th year with the Bureau this month. Police Chief Scott Schubert thanked him for taking on a leadership role.  <br>“We’re a big family, not just with police, but within the City of Pittsburgh. I have no doubt that you’ll lead as a guardian and you’ll use your professional judgement, your experience, and your compassion to help make Pittsburgh an even safer and better place to live.”<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich congratulated Sergeant Lerza on his promotion and thanked him for his work with the K-9 Unit.<br>“It might be a little bit different not having your K-9 partner out there, but you’ll be dealing with the officers out on the street and I’ve always said that the sergeants and lieutenants, they make the difference day to day throughout the city. Their split-second decisions and their supervision of the officers most definitely make a difference between life and death.”<br>Mayor William Peduto recalled the tragic night in January of 2014 that then-Officer Lerza’s K-9 partner, Rocco, was stabbed in the line of duty, later succumbing to his injuries. Peduto remarked on Lerza’s compassion during that moment.<br>“There wasn’t an ounce of anger within you, just the loss and sorrow of losing a friend. That’s the type of person I am really honored to promote because that’s the same sense that will be needed as you go through the next several years training the young officers we continue to recruit and to graduate.”<br>Sergeant Lerza will be assigned to Zone 5 under the leadership of Commander Stephen Vinansky.<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7820_IMG_1397.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7818_IMG_1401.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7822_IMG_1403.JPG)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7821_IMG_1404.JPG) | 3/12/2019 14:28:05 |

| Officers, Traffic Guards Honored at Years of Service Ceremony | PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 4, 2019) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police honored 93 officers and traffic guards during the second annual Years of Service Recognition Ceremony Dec. 3 at the Community College of Allegheny County.<br>Officers and traffic guards were honored for working 25, 30, 35 or 40 years for the Bureau.

The work you do, putting your lives on the line each and every day, is truly incredible. … Knowing we have you out there is something I will forever be grateful for as a friend, as a colleague, and as a resident of Pittsburgh.”<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich thanked crossing guards for shepherding students to school in all types of weather, and officers for choosing Pittsburgh.<br>“You could have gone elsewhere, you could have taken a job with a suburban police agency likely with more pay and more predictable shifts, but you did not," Hissrich said. "You chose Pittsburgh. You made this your home and vowed to stay here and stand guard. … This is a hard job and often thankless. But you stayed with us. And the city of Pittsburgh is a better place because of you.”<br>Mayor William Peduto thanked Police for being a steadying force through the city's decades-long transformation.<br>“You have been the steady rock that has been the stabilizing force in a city did not know if it had a future let alone what that future may look like,” Peduto said. “You dedicated yourself to one thing -- to serve the public, to keep law and order, to protect the children so that they had a future, and to let people know that they have a city that truly does care about them.

| Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Holds Graduation Ceremony | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 13, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire held a graduation ceremony today for Recruit Class 129-19, which began its training on April 29, 2019.<br>Of the 31 recruits, four are following in the footsteps of family members. Three of them are the sons of current or retired firefighters and one is the brother of a current firefighter.<br>Sixteen of the recruits are United States military veterans, making them uniquely suited for the many challenges that lie ahead as members of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. <br>Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones told the class that they are also unique for another reason.<br>“This class, more than any other, exuded the intestinal fortitude, the resiliency, and the can-do attitude that is the fabric of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire,” said Chief Jones.<br>Speaking directly to the families, Chief Jones told them their loved ones were now members of an elite organization, but that their chosen career does not come without sacrifice. He told them there will also be concern for their safety.<br>“Do not worry. They will not be there alone. They will have over 600 of their brothers and sisters right there with them. They will stand with them side by side, back to back, supporting them, encouraging them, and keeping them safe,” said Chief Jones.<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminded the group that they pushed themselves mentally and physically and gave all they had to give during their 32-week journey to become Pittsburgh Firefighters.  <br>But, before administering the Oath of Office, Hissrich told the graduating class that they were also special because they were taught by a legend, Captain James Petruzzi, who will retire next summer.<br>“That means that you, Class 129-19, are his last recruits. Wear that honor proudly. Not only were you taught by the best, but being his last class, he will never forget you. As for you, Captain, I want to personally thank you,” said Hissrich.<br>After being granted the traditional weekend off after graduation by Chief Jones, the newly-minted firefighters will begin work with their platoons at their respective firehouses next week.<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7960_IMG_0429.JPG)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7961_IMG_1454.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7962_IMG_1487.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7964_IMG_1450.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7965_IMG_1499.jpg) | 13/12/2019 14:36:11 |

| Public Safety Statement on Passing of Glenn Cannon | PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 20, 2020) -- It was with great sadness today that Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and the entire City of Pittsburgh Public Safety family learned of the passing of former Director Glenn M. Cannon, Esq.<br>“Few people in the history of our city can match Mr. Cannon in terms of contributions to Pittsburgh and Public Safety,” Director Hissrich said. “He was an extraordinary man who lived an exemplary life. His legacy lives on today as the creator and first leader of the city’s EMS department, and in countless other ways. This is a great loss. Glenn Cannon was a great man and a great Pittsburgher.”<br>Mr. Cannon began his Pittsburgh public service career in 1975 when Mayor Pete Flaherty named him to oversee a citywide mobile intensive care/advanced life support ambulance system, which would become the Emergency Medical Services Department. He led the newly-created Pittsburgh EMS from 1975 to 1986. During that time, he established the city’s first River Rescue Unit, first Specialized Rescue Units and the City’s first Hazardous Materials Response Team.<br>“He was a visionary with a keen sense of detail,” said EMS Chief Ron Romano, who was hired by Cannon in 1978.<br>In 1986, Mayor Richard Caliguiri appointed Mr. Cannon to the position of Public Safety Director, a role in which he led nearly 2,700 employees in Police, Fire, EMS, Building Inspection and Administration and 911. He also served as the City’s Emergency Management Coordinator. He served as Public Safety Director until 1992.<br>“He was a great Public Safety Director, very hands on and very active,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “This is a loss for his family and friends, and my heart goes out to them. It’s also a loss for Public Safety and the city.”<br>Following his Pittsburgh career, Mr. Cannon worked extensively in emergency management at county, state and federal levels.<br>Director Hissrich, a former EMS medic, worked under Mr. Cannon when he was Public Safety Director.<br>“I personally witnessed his leadership at the Bloomfield Train Derailment in 1987 and the Ashland Oil Spill in 1988 while I was assigned to EMS's Rescue Division as a paramedic,” Hissrich said. “I saw firsthand how he was able to gain control of chaotic situations and ensure that First Responders were able to do their jobs effectively.”<br>Mr. Cannon held degrees from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University. He was a partner in the Pittsburgh law firm of Kennedy, Cannon & DeVinney, an adjunct faculty member and Visiting Senior Lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh, and the author of numerous published professional articles. <br>“Glenn was truly a very good friend, leader, and mentor,” said Assistant Fire Chief Norm Auvil, a longtime friend and colleague of Mr. Cannon. “His vision and inspiration led me to focus on family, education, training and public service. He truly has guided my personal and professional path in life.”<br>On behalf of all in Public Safety, Director Hissrich offers his deepest condolences to Mr. Cannon’s surviving family and friends. | 20/1/2020 11:22:45 |
| New K9 Officers Graduate From Academy | PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 24, 2020) – Five new regional K9s were sworn into duty at a graduation ceremony at the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police K9 Training Academy.<br>“We’re very fortunate to have the K9 program in the city -- the handlers are just fantastic in what they do,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “Unfortunately, sometimes they give their lives to protect officers and to protect the public. … We appreciate what you do and as long as I’m Public Safety Director, you’ll have my full support for the K9 program.”<br>The ceremony marked the end of an intensive three-month training program at the K9 Academy, where Pittsburgh Police train K9 officers and handlers from agencies throughout Region 13, which includes counties in southwestern Pennsylvania.<br>“I want to thank you for taking a dog and making it your partner, and to them for allowing you to be their partner,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “It’s a job that not everybody can do. And sometimes it’s a job that not everybody appreciates because they don’t see the amount of work you do, not just the work itself but at home. It really is a 24/7 job.”<br>Graduates in this class included members of Pittsburgh Police, Butler City Police and the Lawrence County Sheriff’s Department:<br>\-\- Pittsburgh Police Officer Kevin Foleyand K9 Shadow<br>\-\- Pittsburgh Police Officer Matt Schwartzmillerand K9 Miky<br>\-\- Butler City Police Lt. Brian Grooms and K9 Chooch<br>\-\- Butler City Police Patrolman Andrew Niederlander and K9 Rico<br>\-\- Lawrence County Sheriff’s Deputy John Baldelli and K9 Baki<br>In addition, Pittsburgh Police Officers Kevin Foley, Rich Houck and Kevin Merkel received training certificates to work as K9 instructors.<br>“You’ve all worked very hard, you’ve all overcome your own personal hurdles with your dogs,” said Sgt. William Watts, one of the K9 instructors. “I still remember seeing you guys two weeks in, you were swearing to me you’d never graduate, that it would never come together. I told you if you kept the faith, the hard work would pay off. And here you are.”<br>[![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/8294_K9_Graduation_Ceremony_Press_Release.png)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/8294_K9_Graduation_Ceremony_Press_Release.png) | 24/1/2020 15:55:07 |
| ANALYSIS: 2019 Crime Rates Drop Again | PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 30, 2020) -- The City of Pittsburgh saw significant reductions in several key crime categories in 2019, most notably in homicides.<br>Police officials credited the reductions to several factors, including excellent police work, a focus on community outreach and engagement, the lifesaving work of medics, firefighters and hospitals, partner law enforcement agencies, and the communities and residents we serve.<br>“So many different things go into it,” Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “First and foremost, it’s hard work by our officers. Day in and day out, they amaze me with their work ethic, expertise and professionalism. And day in and day out, they make me proud to be their Chief. Others also deserve credit, including community members, our law enforcement partners at the local, state and federal levels, our amazing medics and hospitals and our community outreach efforts.<br>“But while these numbers are encouraging, at the end of the day even one homicide is too many, one person being shot is too many,” Chief Schubert said. “So we’ll keep working. We won’t be happy until the numbers are even lower.”<br>Homicides in the city dropped 36 percent year-on-year, from 58 in 2018 to 37 in 2019. The drop continues a downward trend over the past five years, and marks the fewest homicides in the city since 1998. In addition, the number of combined non-fatal shooting incidents plus homicides continued to trend downwards for a fourth year in a row:<br>2016: 253<br>2017: 187<br>2018: 163<br>2019: 146<br>Assistant Chief Lavonnie Bickerstaff noted that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police began its transition from reactive policing to evidence-based and intelligence-led policing in 2016.<br>"This style of policing relies heavily on the Focus Deterrents Model advocated by David Kennedy, who is well known for his work in Boston’s 'Operation Ceasefire,'" Bickerstaff said. "This strategic response allows officers to identify and focus on the small groups of individuals who are actively engaged in violence and hold them accountable for their behavior instead of the entire community. When the police, community, and social services are working together and communicating the same message against violent crime, a true reduction in gun violence can be realized."<br>There were 1,569 violent crimes citywide, a drop of just 0.8 percent from 2018, but an 18.8 percent drop from the five-year average of 1,932 violent crimes per year.<br>"Good police work is helping to keep residents safe," Major Crimes Commander Victor Joseph said. "From patrol officers who do excellent work on their beats to detectives who conduct thorough investigations, the men and women of this Bureau deserve credit. Their hard work and expertise is reflected in these numbers."<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said the expansion of the ShotSpotter system and security cameras played a big role in reducing crime and saving lives. In 2018, ShotSpotter was expanded from three square miles of coverage to 18 square miles of coverage. ShotSpotter uses a network of acoustic sensors to detect when a gun is fired, and then precisely and quickly pinpoints the location of the gunfire, even if no one calls 911. The cameras allow police to review footage in the area of a shooting, identify suspects -- if not catch the actual crime and actor on camera -- and then track them as they flee.<br>"As a result of the ShotSpotter system and city-installed security cameras, police are responding immediately to gunfire and locating victims," Hissrich said. “By responding faster than ever before, officers are able to render aid to victims who otherwise might die. Every officer carries and is trained to use a tourniquet, and the system combined with Pittsburgh Police’s training and the quick response of our EMS medics is, quite simply, saving lives.”<br>Mayor William Peduto added: “The significant drop in crime the last five years is attributable to the tireless work by our officers, our ongoing dedication to community policing, and continual investments in the Bureau that have resulted in the largest Pittsburgh police force in a generation. On behalf of the City I want to thank police and the entire Pittsburgh community for their ongoing dedication to making us a city for all.”<br>Officials also credited city residents.<br>When the public comes forward with tips, police solve crimes. As a result of increased community engagement, more people are helping police investigations by passing on key information. In addition, police programs aimed at connecting with youth allow officers to be viewed as positive influences who can help young people make constructive life decisions.<br>Group Violence Intervention, a strategy in which police focus their efforts on communities' most violent individuals, is also helping. Through GVI, investigators and citizen outreach workers identify individuals who are most likely to commit a violent crime or become a victim of violent crime and hold custom notifications aimed at helping them escape a dangerous lifestyle.<br>"The concept is: We want you to live, we want you to stay out of prison, we want you to be a productive member of society and we want to help you get there," said Rev. Cornell Jones, who leads GVI outreach teams. "It’s not just law enforcement. This is a whole village mentality, it’s all of us working together."<br>Finally, partner law enforcement agencies contribute in numerous ways, including teaming up to disrupt and dismantle criminal enterprises. Pittsburgh Police has great working relationships with many agencies, including the District Attorney’s Office, US Attorney’s Office, FBI Pittsburgh, University police departments, county law enforcement agencies and neighboring regional agencies.<br>While Police and Public Safety officials are pleased with the downward trends, much work remains.<br>Overall crime rates Downtown dropped by 6 percent, but violent crime Downtown increased from 119 cases in 2018 to 136 cases in 2019. Police have added patrols to the Golden Triangle, and plan to staff the Downtown Substation around the clock.<br>Also of concern: Ethnic Intimidation cases increased from 17 total incidents (6 involving violence) in 2018 to 22 total incidents (11 involving violence).<br>Pittsburgh Police have made it a priority to build bridges with every community and resident in the City of Pittsburgh. We will not tolerate hatred against anyone. The increase in ethic intimidation cases mirror national averages, but Pittsburgh Police will continue to combat hate crime in all forms.<br>“We have focused on precision policing through our data-driven policing efforts,” Commander Eric Holmes said. “At the heart of our work is building bridges to the community.

| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Receives Grant to Support Trauma Responsiveness in the Field | PITTSBURGH, PA (February 3, 2020) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is pleased to announce a donation from Allegheny Health Network (AHN) to provide city officers with life-saving hemostatic gauze, bolstering preparedness in response to traumatic injuries in the field.<br>NuStat Tactical is a sterile dressing that is applied to trauma wounds to control bleeding and prevent infection until a patient can be transported to the hospital. <br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich says expanding the distribution of this product to police officers is another important tool in an officer's toolkit.<br>“Police officers have already saved numerous lives using tourniquets and other equipment at their disposal, so providing a wider distribution of these types of tools can help save even more lives. Similar to things like Narcan, the more it’s out there in the field, the more likely we are to save lives,” said Hissrich.<br>AHN has provided 1,000 NuStat gauze packages, which have now been issued to every Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officer. The single-use dressing is already used widely by EMS, the military, and hospitals and can serve as a valuable, life-saving instrument for both officers and civilians in the event of a traumatic injury.<br>"Uncontrolled bleeding can result in death in five minutes or fewer," said Allie Quick, Chief Philanthropy Officer, AHN. "Similar to how the general public learns and performs CPR, learning proper bleeding control techniques, including how to use your hands, dressings and tourniquets, can be life-saving knowledge in an emergency situation. We are grateful to work so closely with our police force to ensure that our city is as prepared as possible to respond to emergencies." | 3/2/2020 11:02:19 |

| Public Safety Statement on St. Patrick's Day Security | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 13, 2020) — Despite the cancellation of the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade, the City of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department is prepared for celebrations and large localized crowds tomorrow.<br>With serious COVID-19 concerns, this year’s holiday will be different than past years.<br>Some things, however, will not change—including Public Safety’s determination to catch anyone drinking and driving.<br>“With COVID-19 and the cancellation of the parade, we anticipate lighter crowds than years past,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “But we will still maintain a zero tolerance policy for disruptive and illegal behavior. Underage drinking and drinking and driving in particular will be targeted. We want people to enjoy themselves, but to do so responsibly.”<br>Pittsburgh Bureau of Police DUI Patrols will actively seek anyone who drives under the influence. Plan ahead, use Lyft, Uber and Z-Trip, and never drive while under the influence or get in a vehicle with a driver who is intoxicated. Pittsburgh Police will also have undercover officers and uniformed officers targeting law-breakers.<br>State, County and City Mounted Units will be deployed, and River Rescue will be active on the waterways. State Police, County Police, the Sheriff’s Department and police agencies from local universities and other public safety partners will be out as well.<br>Be mindful of pedestrian safety. Wearlight-colored clothing so motorists can see you. Don’t wear headphones while walking. Be aware of your surroundings.<br>In addition this year — and in light of COVID-19 concerns — focus on personal hygiene and social distancing. Wash your hands regularly, do not share drinks, and maintain personal space of at least six feet from others.Public Safety understands that social distancing will be a challenge in bar or restaurant settings, which is why officials are urging businesses to lower their occupancy rates and give people more space. Police, firefighters andinspectors from Permits, Licenses and Inspectionswill be on the ground, strictly enforcing occupancy maximums. | 13/3/2020 11:40:49 |

On April 2, the officer was tested. The results came back positive on April 4.<br>The officer is in self-isolation at home.<br>The officer is an instructor with the Police Academy and was recently in contact with recruits. Police officials are in the process of identifying and notifying everyone who had contact with the officer and placing them in self-quarantine.<br>All equipment and gear the officer used has been thoroughly cleaned. Officials are checking in daily with the officer.<br>For privacy reasons, Public Safety is not releasing the officer's name.<br>**UPDATE:**<br>**The following is a statement from Chief Scott Schubert on the positive test of a PBP officer:**<br>“The safety and well-being of our officers is always a top priority for me and my Command Staff, but officer health is especially important now as the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police are on the front lines of this battle day in and day out. Simply put, for us to help the public, we need officers to be healthy.<br>“For that reason, and out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily suspended a 28-person recruit class as we identify who among them might have been exposed to a firearms instructor that has tested positive for COVID-19. Any exposure would have occurred at the outdoor Police firing range in Zone 5 and not in the Academy.<br>“We’ve made several adjustments as we face this virus, including the suspension of all in-service training more than three weeks ago. We suspended the training of a new recruit class, but continued the training of this class because they were close to satisfying their training requirements. The class was isolated from other officers and was instructed to maintain social distancing. It is not known where the officer who tested positive contracted the virus. We have instructed numerous recruits who might have come into contact with him at the range to self-quarantine, and we will be monitoring their health daily. Anyone who shows symptoms will be tested. At this time, one recruit has shown symptoms and has been tested, but the results are not in yet.<br>“These are stressful times. And First Responders simply cannot work from home. I stand in awe of my officers for the way they have dedicated themselves to our communities during this most difficult time.”<br>**A statement from Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich on the positive test:**<br>“We are taking every possible preventative measure to ensure the safety of all our First Responders. But we are dealing with an unprecedented and unpredictable threat. This is our first officer to test positive, and the second member of Public Safety after a firefighter tested positive last week. Hopefully we will have no more positive tests. But as we have seen in other cities, First Responders are often deeply impacted by this virus.” | 6/4/2020 14:43:49 |

| Police Chief Responds to Tragic and Senseless Death of George Floyd | PITTSBURGH, PA (May 29, 2020)—The following is a message Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Chief Scott Schubert sent bureau-wide at 6 a.m. today. Public Safety is releasing it publicly in response to questions from the public and media about PBP’s response to the tragic and senseless death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.<br>Colleagues,<br>I'm certain many of you have by now viewed the video of George Floyd’s in-custody death in Minneapolis on May 25.<br>Like you, I was deeply disturbed and saddened by what I saw.<br>This is not how we are trained to restrain people and it's not what we stand for as police officers.<br>Regardless of the original crime or what occurred prior to the arrest, a person in handcuffs and face-down on the ground should not lose their life due to the action or inaction of the involved officers. It was difficult to watch Mr. Floyd pleading for help and gasping for breath before saying his final words—all while pedestrians frantically pleaded with officers to help him. I simply cannot comprehend the actions of the officers or their lack of moral courage and duty to intervene and stop the action before it was too late. My prayers are with Mr. Floyd and his family during this most difficult time.<br>As police officers, we have a fundamental duty to care for and safeguard everyone and anyone in our custody. That did not occur with this particular incident. A man was deprived of his life, a family wasdeprivedof their loved one, a community wasdeprivedof their faith in the people who are entrusted to keep them safe and our noble profession wasdeprivedof its legitimacy by the incomprehensible and senseless actions of a few.There was no consideration for the value of human life and that is inexcusable. These officers don’t represent any of us in law enforcement and must face the consequences for their actions! We are better than this. We must continue to do what's right. <br>I'm thankful for the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. I know the high level of training each of you have received and I know firsthand the high level of professionalism, bravery, courage and compassion our officers display on a daily basis. We have sworn an oath and I trust that all of us will use our moral courage to intervene when we see something wrong. We owe it to each another, we owe it to our noble profession and we owe it to the community we protect and serve.<br>I have asked the Academy to review this senseless death and share additional information that can help reinforce our training and policies. Excessive force is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at any level.<br>Thank you for your commitment to selfless service. Please stay safe and healthy!<br>Scott<br>Chief Scott E.

| Law Enforcement Creates Taskforce Related to Pittsburgh Protests | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 5, 2020)—The majority of the recent protests in the City of Pittsburgh have been peaceful, with only a small group of people intent on causing destruction.<br>The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in partnership with multiple local agencies and the general public, has launched investigations into individuals within that small group—people who have attacked journalists, looted business, caused property damage and committed other crimes such as arson. The unified body overseeing these investigations—the Damage Assessment and Accountability Taskforce (DAAT)—was formed earlier this week.<br>In connection to this taskforce, police arrestedMatthew Michanowicz, 52, of Duquesne Heights after police recovered a backpack with homemade explosives on Monday. After reviewing security camera footage, investigators determined Michanowicz placed the bag there on Sunday and then left. Pittsburgh Police are working in conjunction with federal investigators on the case.<br>“The DAAT will continue to review previous intelligence indicating past violence against property, journalists, private citizens and law enforcement,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “That intelligence includes online threats to damage and loot businesses, and detailed instructions on how to make a Molotov cocktail. These threats are real: On Saturday, a protester threw an improvised incendiary device at a Pittsburgh Police Officer near Mellon Square, which exploded on the ground and caused a nearby officer to suffer concussion-like symptoms. Police are actively investigating.”<br>The taskforce is also investigating the looting and/or vandalism of dozens of businesses in the city, and assaults on at least five journalists.<br>The City, Public Safety and Police Bureau have long held as a guiding principle the belief that all people have a fundamental right to protest peacefully, as is guaranteed by the First Amendment. Police will monitor all protests, try to anticipate the group’s movement and then close roadways in advance of the protesters in order to keep them safe. Law enforcement intervenes only when violence occurs and a gathering has been deemed unlawful. At that time, orders to disperse are issued.<br>DAAT is amulti-agency team comprised of local, state, and federal Law Enforcement partners, to include: Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office, Allegheny County Police, Allegheny County Sheriff’s Department, Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office, Pennsylvania State Police, FBI Pittsburgh, the US Attorneys Office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.<br>The taskforce is interviewing witnesses and victims of crime and assessing all property damage related to the protests. They are analyzing digital evidence gathered from police body worn cameras, City cameras and all available private CCTV footage.More arrests are pending.<br>Members of the public can also help.

| Fireworks Taskforce Formed | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 26, 2020)—Pittsburghers love Fourth of July fireworks shows.<br>But with public shows cancelled this year due to Covid-19 concerns, many people across the city are conducting private shows in neighborhoods citywide. Indeed, from June 1 to June 21, Pittsburgh Police received 137 fireworks complaint calls— _a 389 percent increase_ over the 28 calls received over the same period last year.<br>While this spike is also occurring in cities across the country, Public Safety officials remind local residents and visitors that consumer fireworks—even those that were recently legalized—pose significant dangers to people and property, and that fireworks can almost never be set off legally inside city limits.<br>“As a Pittsburgh native myself, I understand that fireworks are an important part of the way we celebrate our Independence Day,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “Unfortunately, as a result of the ongoing battle against the deadly Coronavirus, all fireworks and public gatherings have been cancelled this year. Please remember that fireworks are a real fire hazard and can be very dangerous. I urge everyone to exercise caution this year and not use them.”<br>To address the illegal use of fireworks in city neighborhoods, a Fireworks Taskforce made up of Pittsburgh Police and Fire Investigators was formed this week. The taskforce will patrol city nieghborhoods and respond to 911 calls for illegal fireworks.<br>City law prohibits the use of fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of any structure. Fireworks are also prohibited in all parks, any public space and on private property without consent of the landowner.<br>Anyone caught violating fireworks law is subject to a $100 fine and the possible seizure of their fireworks.<br>“Fireworks are not safe, especially in the hands of children,” Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire’s Fire Prevention Officer Lisa Epps-Cuda said. “Not even sparklers are safe. Think about it: Water boils at 212 degrees, wood burns at 575 degrees, glass melts at 900 degrees and sparklers burn at 1,200 degrees. Why would you put something like that in the hands of a child?” | 26/6/2020 09:41:07 |
| Fourth of July Safety Announcement | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2020)—The Fourth of July, like everything else these days, will take on a different look and feel this year.<br>As a result of the ongoing global pandemic, there will be no City-sponsored fireworks show, no mass gatherings at the Point or North Shore, and no alcohol consumption at bars Downtown, in the Southside or anywhere else in the county.<br>As such, Public Safety’s approach this year will also change.<br>Pittsburgh Police and several partner law enforcement agencies will still be out on Saturday, but rather than assuring safety for large crowds of revelers, they will seek to counsel people not adhering to proper physical distancing or public mask-wearing, instructing any large groups that do assemble to disperse, and enforcing laws.<br>“This is certainly going to be a unique Independence Day in Pittsburgh, and not necessarily in a positive way,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “We all know that these are uncertain and trying times. But if we can pull together as a city and each of us do our part to keep ourselves and our neighbors safe, hopefully we can come together as a city next year and have a Fourth of July celebration that no one will ever forget.”<br>Director Hissrich, EMS Chief Ron Romano, Fire Chief Darryl Jones and Police Chief Scott Schubert provide the following safety tips for this year’s holiday weekend:<br>—Do not use fireworks illegally.<br>Although some consumer fireworks were recently legalized, they remain a fire hazard and safety concern. As a reminder, fireworks are not allowed in Point State Park or any City park. In addition, the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, are prohibited within 150 feet of any structure, on any public land and on private property without the landowner’s permission.<br>Due to a dramatic surge in fireworks complaints, Public Safety formed a Fireworks Taskforce to patrol city neighborhoods and target anyone using fireworks illegally. For more information, follow this link to the taskforce press release:<br>[https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4096](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4096)<br>—Do not fire guns in the air.<br>Celebratory gunfire is dangerous and, frankly, stupid. But it remains a problem in many cities, particularly on the Fourth of July and New Year’s Eve. Bullets fired into the air must come down, and when they do the results can be deadly. Pittsburgh Police in all six zones will respond to ShotSpotter activations and arrest anyone caught firing a gun in public.<br>—Practice water safety.<br>With City pools closed, some residents will take to private pools and rivers to swim. These options carry significant risk as there is typically not a qualified life guard on duty. River Rescue, the Fire Boat and the Coast Guard will be on the city’s three rivers to enforce boating laws and teach water safety.<br>—Follow pandemic guidelines.<br>Maintain proper physical distancing. Wear a mask. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds often. Avoid large crowds. Stay home if you’re not feeling well.<br>In other words, all of the advice health experts have been repeating for months, follow them. Allegheny County is experiencing a spike in new Covid-19 cases. We can reverse this trend, but only if we follow the experts’ advice.<br>—Prepare for heat.<br>The Fourth of July traditionally brings heat and humidity, and this year will be no different. Temperatures are forecast to be above 90 for many days in a row. Limit alcohol intake and drink plenty of water.<br>—Do not drink and drive.<br>Ever. Patrols will be out actively searching for and arresting impaired drivers. When it comes to drinking and driving, Public Safety has a zero-tolerance policy.<br>—Remember your pets.<br>Please keep them in a safe place. Many dogs are panicked by fireworks and will run away when they hear them. Animal Care & Control sees an increase in lost pets every year in the weeks leading up to the Fourth of July.<br>Again, we understand that 2020 has been challenging on multiple fronts and that this year’s celebrations will necessarily be different. Let’s all keep a level head during these strange days, with the understanding that our best days as a city are ahead of us. Public Safety thanks you and wishes all a happy, albeit muted, Fourth of July. | 1/7/2020 10:02:22 |
| Fireworks Incidents Underscore Fourth of July Public Safety Concerns | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 3, 2020) -- As we head into the Independence Day weekend, last night kept the Fireworks Taskforce extremely busy with a total of 85 fireworks complaint calls across all six police zones.<br>Three of those calls proved to be another strong reminder of the dangers of fireworks in the City. <br>At around 11 p.m. taskforce members warned a group of people shooting off fireworks from the baseball field at Horace Mann School on the 2800 block of Shadeland Avenue to stop and clean up their debris. About 40 minutes later the roof of the abandoned school was discovered to be on fire. <br>Firefighters battled and put out the 2-alarm blaze that caused an estimated $50,000 to $60,000 damage. <br>Another incident resulted in an injury. A firework was thrown into the gym at McNaugher School in the 2600 block of Maple Street during a dance class. One juvenile female received a minor burn to her foot.<br>Earlier in the day, a large brush fire on Rose Street in the Hill District was extinguished before it could spread to any structures or cause injuries. That fire was also believed to have been caused by fireworks.<br>These incidents are being investigated. There are no arrests at this time, but anyone with information is urged to call the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police at (412) 323-7800. <br>State law prohibits the use of fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of any structure. Fireworks are also prohibited in all parks, any public space, and on private property without consent of the landowner. Anyone caught violating fireworks law is subject to a $100 fine and the possible seizure of their fireworks. <br>The Fireworks Task Force would also like people to know that the release of sky lanterns is illegal.<br>"We at Public Safety know this Fourth of July weekend is not the kind Pittsburghers are used to. It's frustrating that we can't gather and celebrate with our usual, grand fireworks display that everyone can enjoy," Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. "Many people will be tempted to put on their own displays, but I urge them to refrain and celebrate in other ways in order to stay safe during these challenging times." | 3/7/2020 11:18:56 |
| Statement from the Family of Officer Calvin Hall | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 17, 2020) — The following is a statement from the family of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officer CalvinHall:<br>“It has been one year since our loved one was abruptly taken from us, and not a day goes by that we do not mourn him. The pain is just as present today as it was a year ago. His death represents so many others who are gone too soon, gone due to the unnecessary violence that continues to plague our communities.<br>“We are still trying to process what happened and why. But we remain in constant hope that justice will be served, not only for Calvin but for all who have lost their lives at the hands of others due to ignorance, hatred, and prejudice.<br>“The Hall Family would like to thank the Pittsburgh Police and the city of Pittsburgh for standing in solidarity to combat racial inequities. We would also like to thank Mayor William Peduto, Braddock Police, Point Park University Police, and the Housing Authority for keeping Calvin’s legacy alive.<br>“We are keeping everyone in our thoughts and prayers during these trying times. Thank you, and be safe.”<br>Officer Hall was shot in the early morning hours of July 14, 2019. He died from his injuries July 17, 2019. As the investigation is ongoing, Pittsburgh Police will have no further comment on his murder. But we will continue to pray for Officer Hall’s family, and to be ever thankful that the PBP was blessed, albeit briefly, with Calvin’s presence. | 17/7/2020 09:56:34 |

| Pittsburgh Police and Global Links Bring the, “Need a Mask, Take a Mask” Initiative to a Close | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 30, 2020) - The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and Global Links are winding down their successful campaign to help protect Pittsburgh residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>Since May, more than 100,000 free masks have been distributed to residents through the, “Need a Mask, Take a Mask” initiative. Protective cloth masks were made available at all six Pittsburgh Police zones and two substations, placed inside newspaper boxes on loan from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Tribune-Review.<br>Additional masks were also handed out with Grab and Go lunches at Citiparks – City of Pittsburgh Department of Parks and Recreation senior and recreation centers and to 70 other community partners.<br>This innovative collaboration was made possible thanks to Global Links, which donated the masks to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police in an effort to help community members comply with Governor Tom Wolf’s facemask order and flatten the curve at the height of the pandemic.<br>“Pittsburgh Police jumped at the chance to collaborate with Global Links, a renowned medical relief and development organization that repurposes surplus resources to meet local and international needs,” said Pittsburgh Police Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa. “Through this initiative we were able to help play a small part in safeguarding our communities and educating our neighbors about the importance of protective mask use during COVID-19.

| Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Enhances Swift Water and Flood Response Capabilities | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 2, 2020) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire is pleased to announce that it has completed training to become recognized as a Type-3A swift water and flood response team by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Bureau of Emergency Medical Services and the Office of the State Fire Commissioner. <br>Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones began putting together a swift water rescue team shortly after a severe rain storm caused flash flooding along Washington Boulevard in August 2011, killing four people.  <br>“We were not prepared at that time and now we are prepared. We’ve been working toward this certification that now recognizes the technician-level training our teams have achieved and officially states that we meet the standard to perform this task, this rescue, this duty,” said Jones. <br>Under the guidance of Chief Jones, Captain Patrick Shaw with Engine Truck 17 has headed up the training program over the past eight years.  <br>“Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire is on PEMA’s radar now. If a hurricane comes through the Eastern part of the state, PEMA can request our Type 3-A team. We’re actually providing a better service to the citizens, they pay their taxes and we’re here to give them a better service. We are trained at the technician level and a top notch rescue team is what they have now.” said Shaw. <br>Thirty-eight firefighters are trained and certified at the technician level, split between two separate squads. The Type-3A certification makes the teams a regional asset deployable outside of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County for flash flood and disaster response.  <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11537_IMG_3462_(1).jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11538_IMG_3461_(1).jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11539_IMG_3460_(1).jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11541_IMG_3470_(1).jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/11542_IMG_3471_(1).jpg) | 2/10/2020 10:32:07 |

Multiple others have been placed in quarantine out of an abundance of caution in order to stop the spread, including about 100 Police officers. <br>“The number fluctuates daily, but understand that those who are in quarantine are not positive. They are off as a precaution,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said Tuesday. “All but one of the (positive) employees are recuperating at home. One was hospitalized, but has been improving daily. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected.” <br>Public Safety’s positive test rates remain significantly lower that what other major city First Responders are experiencing. The low infection rates have allowed Public Safety to proactively quarantine everyone who was possibly exposed, and to maintain normal staffing levels. <br>“When you call 911, rest assured you’re going to get the assistance you need,” Hissrich said. “We’re going a step above what is required. Our numbers have been so low that we can take these precautions. … We have to be cautious and we have to make sure our First Responders have the equipment and the training they need to respond to every call.” <br>Several preventative steps are in place across all Public Safety bureaus, and have been since March, including: Mandatory masks and social distancing, daily screenings upon entry to any Public Safety facility, and strict quarantine/isolation procedures. <br>EMS, Fire and Police officials meet daily via Teams Meetings with Director Hissrich and the City of Pittsburgh’s Medical Director, Dr. Ronald Roth, to discuss the pandemic. EMS has reactivated a second specialized EMS unit with enhanced decontamination capabilities and advanced PPE to respond to suspected Covid cases. <br>“We’re taking all the precautions we can,” Hissrich said. “We’ve learned a lot over the last few months (and) we’re taking this very seriously | 17/11/2020 14:13:22 |
| Public Safety Statement on a Different New Year's Eve | PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 30, 2020) — As with nearly everything in this challenging and tumultuous year, Pittsburgh’s New Year’s Eve celebrations will be different from years past. <br>Dec. 31 is traditionally a night that draws tens of thousands of people to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Highmark First Night Pittsburgh celebrations at venues throughout Downtown. <br>Not this year.<br>Due to the pandemic, venues are closed, large gatherings are prohibited, fireworks have been cancelled and First Night has transformed into a [made-for-TV-only](http://firstnightpgh.trustarts.org/) event. <br>“I know that we all want—and absolutely deserve—to celebrate New Year’s Eve as we always do: With family and friends, with fireworks and with fanfare,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “That’s just not possible or responsible this year. Better times are certainly ahead, but we must maintain our resolve now in order to see this pandemic through to the end.” <br>Hissrich re-issued his traditional New Year’s Eve message, with a caveat: Celebrate responsibly—ideally at home—and do not engage in dangerous or illegal activities. <br>Such activities include shooting guns off in the air. What goes up will come down, and the results are [tragic](https://www.shotspotter.com/system/content-uploads/MYTHS_about_Celebratory_Gunfire.pdf) when people are hit by celebratory gunfire. Just last year, a woman in Texas was [struck and killed](https://abcnews.go.com/US/houston-woman-apparently-killed-celebratory-gunfire-years-police/story?id=68021884) by a descending bullet as she stood in her driveway to watch fireworks. There have been many other documented cases of celebratory gunfire killing innocent people. Police will monitor and respond to ShotSpotter activations throughout the city. Officers will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. <br>As a reminder, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure.<br>Never drink and drive. Officers will be actively looking for impaired motorists. <br>Lastly, please adhere to the Governor’s health regulations regarding Covid-19. Wear a mask, social distance and do not attend gatherings with people from outside of your home. <br>Be safe, Pittsburghers, as we rightfully banish 2020 to the ash heap of history and turn a hopeful eye to what might lie ahead. | 30/12/2020 09:20:20 |
| Pittsburgh Police, FBI, ATF Investigate Two Separate Explosives Incidents | PITTSBURGH, PA (January 4, 2021) - Last evening, Pittsburgh Police Zone 2 officers, the Fire Investigation Unit, and the Bomb Squad responded to two separate incidents involving explosives. <br>The first incident that occurred in the 3600 block of Penn Avenue just after 9 p.m. involved an Improvised Explosive Device (IED). A parked vehicle sustained damage to its undercarriage as a result of the blast.

| Two Women Honored in Council Chambers for Saving a Stranger on the Homestead Grays Bridge | February 24, 2021 (PITTSBURGH, PA) -- On the morning of January 28 of this year, a series of unpredictable detours resulted in a mother and daughter from West Mifflin driving over the Homestead Grays Bridge and ultimately saving the life of a stranger.<br>Tanikka Pinnix and Layla Gooden spotted a woman in distress, not wearing a coat, with one leg up on the bridge railing. They quickly pulled their vehicle over and managed to calmly convince the woman to come down to safety, all before emergency services personnel had arrived at the scene.<br>Today in Council Chambers, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, on behalf of Mayor William Peduto and City Council, proclaimed Wednesday, February 24, 2021 Tanikka Pinnix and Layla Gooden Day, recognizing them as outstanding citizens who undoubtedly prevented a tragedy through their kindness and empathy.<br>Director Hissrich was on the bridge that day, along with Bureau of Emergency Medical Services Division Chief Richard Linn and District Chief Justin Sypolt, to witness the positive outcome, thanks to the selfless actions of Ms. Pinnix and Ms. Gooden.<br>“I have responded to well over a dozen of these types of incidents and most don’t turn out well for the victim. It is comforting to know that by your work, that this one, this incident, even though it was a personal tragedy for the individual, that stranger that you saved continues to be able to live today and receive the help that she needs,” said Director Hissrich.<br>EMS District Chief Sypolt honored the women and thanked them on behalf of the Public Safety and EMS Bureaus.<br>“I know that on that day you probably didn’t wake up thinking that today’s the day I’m going to change the world, but due to a series of unpredictable events, change the world you did.

| Pittsburgh Police and Regional Law Enforcement Partners Address Off-Road Vehicle Use in Urban Centers | March 2, 2021 (PITTSBURGH, PA) -- In 2020, the City of Pittsburgh began witnessing large numbers of unlawful, off-road vehicles such as ATV’s and dirt bikes riding recklessly on city streets, taking over roadways and intersections, driving on sidewalks and, in many cases, even driving the wrong direction. <br>Major cities across the country have also been experiencing the same issues associated with these illegal vehicles, sometimes with deadly consequences. Last September in New York City, an ATV rider was struck and killed by an SUV when he drove into a crosswalk against a red light. Two years ago another rider lost an eye during a collision. In Pittsburgh last summer, a dirt bike rider driving in a bicycle lane on Liberty Avenue was injured when he clipped a turning vehicle and was thrown from his dirt bike onto the back of a parked car. <br>Participants in these so–called “flash mobs” or “ride-outs” are now taking their actions to alarming new heights in the City of Pittsburgh, with as many as 50 to 200 riders roving through neighborhoods at any given time, disobeying traffic rules. Just this past week in the City, police issued eight citations and towed two vehicles from a ride-out event. One of those citations stemmed from a traffic stop where a dirt-bike rider was driving the wrong way toward police on N. Beatty Street. These all-terrain vehicles are not designed to be driven on public roads and they pose a serious danger to the general public, law enforcement, and to the illegal riders themselves.  <br>“It is just a matter of time before this irresponsible behavior leads to a serious injury or death either of the rider, or to an innocent pedestrian or motorist in Pittsburgh,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. <br>As a result, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in collaboration with its regional law enforcement partners, has devised a comprehensive operational plan to address this issue. The three-pronged response will focus on the following:  <br>1. Education and community outreach    <br>2. Law enforcement collaboration     <br>3. Investigation and enforcement <br>As part of the investigative process, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and its law enforcement partners will utilize any available technology to stop these unauthorized vehicles from driving on city streets.<br>“Police want people to enjoy their ATV’s and dirt bikes, but to do so in a legal and safe way. We cannot address this problem alone and we are asking for the public’s help to put an end to these dangerous and disruptive ride-outs in the City,” said Pittsburgh Police Commander Eric Holmes.   <br>The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has created an email address for the public to provide information and tips to Police. Emails can be sent to:  <br>[412\_TIPS@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:412_TIPS@pittsburghpa.gov).   <br>As always, please dial 9-1-1 in an emergency. | 25/2/2021 06:42:44 |

Kari Burnham, one of five women in the Bureau, is now the highest-ranking female in the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, and the first woman promoted to Lt. since 1995.<br>Such ceremonies typically occur in Council Chambers at the City-County Building.

| Opioid Overdose Dashboard to Address Unsafe Opioid Use | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 5, 2021)—The Office of Mayor William Peduto, Pittsburgh Public Safety and the Office of Community Health and Safety announce the creation of the [Opioid Overdose Dashboard](https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/overdose-dashboard), a public tool that will help form and guide policies and programs to more effectively address unsafe opioid use in the City of Pittsburgh.<br>The dashboard compiles Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS data to map monthly opioid overdose calls and Public Safety’s response. Data will include the number of people who overdose, neighborhood-level mapping, demographic information, and other statistics regarding care provided by on-scene First Responders.<br>"While this is a data-driven initiative, it's really about using all the resources at the City's disposal into giving our residents a helping hand. That means cross-department coordination, best practices in care and support, and now a Dashboard to help guide our work as effectively as possible," Mayor William Peduto said.<br>First Responders, to include Pittsburgh EMS, Fire and Police, respond to drug overdoses and have saved many lives through their training and the use of Narcan and CPR, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said.<br>“And they will continue to save lives,” Hissrich said. “But to more effectively address the root of the problem, everyone must join together. Having more data will lead to a better understanding of the issues and, hopefully, actionable solutions.”<br>In addition to the public dashboard, the Office of Community Health and Safety will issue weekly reports to City staff and partner organizations, including healthcare, public health, and harm reduction organizations, with the goal of coordinating an equitable public health-informed response to the overdose crisis. This data will also provide the Office of Community Health and Safety and its partners with a more complete picture of the impacted neighborhoods, allowing for direct engagement with community leaders who best understand the needs of their neighbors.    <br>“In response to the worsening crisis, the Office of Community Health and Safety is committed to utilizing insights gained from improved data analysis to inform progressive opioid overdose prevention strategies that seek to reduce harm associated with drug use, employ a person-first approach, and address social determinants of health,” said Laura Drogowski, Office of Community Health and Safety Manager.<br>Within the Office of Community Health and Safety, this work will be led by the Overdose Prevention Program Coordinator in partnership with Pittsburgh EMS and the Allegheny County Health Department’s CDC-funded Overdose Data to Action program, which aims to strengthen local capacity to address overdoses across the county. The City of Pittsburgh is among stakeholders partnering with ACHD through this county-wide program to monitor emerging trends to inform prevention activities that reduce harms associated with substance use.<br>Mayor Peduto created The Office of Community Health and Safety in June with the goal of redirecting city resources to better meet community needs by housing social services, public health and social work experts who can assist first responders in situations that require longer-term assistance, harm reduction support and other services.  For more information on the office, click [here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4052). | 5/3/2021 10:08:49 |
| Public Safety Statement on St. Patrick's Day Celebrations | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 12, 2021) — For a second consecutive year, St. Patrick’s Day celebrations in Pittsburgh will be decidedly different and muted because of ongoing Covid-19 safety measures.  <br>Health officials continue to encourage pandemic protocols restricting large crowds and encouraging mask-wearing, social distancing and hand-washing. Bar and restaurant occupancy restrictions will reduce crowd sizes at traditional holiday gathering spots, including the Southside, North Shore and Downtown. The annual St. Patrick’s Day parade has been moved to the fall.  <br>While many people are understandably weary of pandemic restrictions, Pittsburgh Public Safety urges continued vigilance, and promises a continued focus on keeping everyone safe and catching law-breakers.  <br>“Now is not the time to let down our guard,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “Covid-19 has forced us down a long and unwanted path, but this journey will near its end if—and only if—we maintain our discipline in fighting this virus.”  <br>As always, Director Hissrich announced a zero-tolerance policy for disruptive and illegal behavior, to include underage drinking, public intoxication and drinking and driving. Pittsburgh Police and partner law enforcement agencies will monitor crowds for any illegal activity, and DUI Patrols will actively seek anyone who drives under the influence.  <br>Open container laws will be strictly enforced. While the state has allowed restaurants to sell cocktails-to-go during the pandemic, it is illegal for such beverages to be consumed in public spaces. Please note that anyone caught with an open container will be cited.  <br>Pittsburgh Fire officials will conduct occupancy checks, and will clear and close any establishment that exceeds occupancy limits.  <br>Law enforcement will also cite and arrest anyone caught [illegally driving](https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4727) off-road vehicles on city streets. We ask the public to send tips on such illegal rides to [412\_TIPS@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:412_TIPS@pittsburghpa.gov).   <br>Police will monitor City Security Cameras for illegal activity. Officers on horseback, bicycles, motorcycles and foot patrols will also be utilized.  <br>Lastly, Public Safety encourages anyone who chooses to go out to wear a mask, wash your hands and maintain social distancing.  <br>With more people getting vaccinated and practicing common sense precautions, life will return to normal. The time to celebrate publicly will come. But in the continued age of Covid-19, Public Safety urges everyone to celebrate at home, avoid large crowds and—if you do go out—act responsibly. | 11/3/2021 08:08:31 |
| New Firefighters Are Sworn In | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 19, 2021)—The latest Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire recruit class was sworn in during a ceremony Friday morning at the Fire Academy on Washington Boulevard. <br>“Today, after 32-plus weeks, you have patches on your sleeve; you represent the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire,” Fire Chief Darryl Jones said. “A lot of pride comes with that. I appreciate that because I am also very proud to have the patches on my sleeve. <br>“But there’s more than just pride. There’s responsibility. And there is privilege. You have the privilege to serve the people of Pittsburgh—our residents, our visitors, our guests. That is a privilege.” <br>Mayor William Peduto administered the oath to the 23 recruit graduates, who started their journey at the academy in April. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich applauded the recruits' hard work, but also took time to acknowledge their families for the sacrifices they have and will make. <br>“To the families, thank you very much for loaning us your loved ones,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “They will have good days, they will have bad days. They will need your support. So in advance, thank you.” <br>The class started and finished during a pandemic, which required patience and adjustments to how skills were taught. For example, a typical class has 32 recruits, but this one started with 24 and graduated 23. The smaller class was needed in order to comply with the Governor’s Covid-19 measures banning gatherings larger than 25 people. <br>Still, they endured. And on Monday, they will begin their careers as Pittsburgh Firefighters.  <br>“It’s not a career that many people would be willing to do knowing the possibility of having to be in a situation where you’re valuing somebody else more than yourself—you’re willing to put yourself at risk in order to help someone else,” Mayor Peduto said. “It’s a job unlike other jobs. It’s a calling.” <br>The graduation ceremony and a skills demonstration were livestreamed and can be found on the [Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire](https://fb.watch/4kGw1sL41n/) and [Pittsburgh Public Safety](https://www.facebook.com/PghPublicSafety/posts/3935797799815708) Facebook pages.<br>[![Firefighter graduation](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13589_FireGrad1.jpg)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13580_FireGrad1.jpg)<br>[![Firefighter Graduation](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13587_FireGrad2.jpg)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13582_FireGrad2.jpg)<br>[![Firefighter Graduation](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13588_FireGrad3.jpg)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13585_FireGrad3.jpg)<br>[![Firefighter Graduation](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13590_FireGrad4.jpg)](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/13583_FireGrad4.jpeg) | 19/3/2021 15:19:30 |

| City Launches New Victim Assistance Website | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 25, 2021)—Often overlooked in the criminal process are the victims, people whose lives are instantly altered through no choice of their own. <br>The City of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department strives to help victims of crime through The Office of Victim Assistance Services, which connects victims to any type of service they might need, including crisis intervention, referrals, information and advocacy.  <br>“As a victim of crime, you’ve just experienced trauma, an unexpected trauma,” said Victim Services Coordinator Alexandra Abboud. “At the flip of a switch, your whole life has changed—the way you see the world, the way you interact with the world, the way you lived your day to life has changed. And (victims) don’t know where to go and they don’t what to do. They need guidance to get them through this and to say, okay, what is our next step?” <br>Abboud checks crime reports daily to identify victims of crime, contact them and offer support. Any other victims seeking resources can now find it on the City’s newly-launched [Victim Assistance website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/victim-assistance-services), which provides contacts to the Office and numerous other city and regional resources. <br>“Victims of crime experience trauma from the incident itself and trauma from the barriers encountered when accessing systems that were created to provide support and resources,” said Shatara Murphy, Public Safety Assistant Director, Community Affairs. “The Victim Assistance Office is the support that families need, helping to eliminate some of those barriers and connect them to service providers and support. This isn’t just a warm hand off. The office is dedicated to the victim and their family and will be by their side throughout the process. When Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich created this office and asked me to manage it, we were clear that we didn’t just want to be another resource. We will serve as a partner to the community and we are committed to that partnership.” <br>Mayor William Peduto said the effort is part of the City’s goal of helping all residents. <br>"Public Safety provides many services but at the department's heart is one main goal, and that is to be there for people in need of help. Having a coordinator in place whose sole job is providing assistance to victims is a major part of the City's efforts to give help to all, and especially those who are most vulnerable,” Mayor Peduto said.<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he is proud of the work of the Victims Assistance Office, as it speaks to the City- and Department-wide desire to put others first. <br>“Public Safety is a dynamic department that doesn’t only include First Responders who save lives daily in times of urgency and emergency,” Hissrich said. “It also includes compassionate people who methodically consider the long-term needs of those who need help, and then take steps to provide it.” <br>Abboud, who started in her position on Aug. 3, 2020, said her goal is to help victims throughout the process, which often means multiple follow-up contacts. <br>“They need somebody to talk to, somebody to listen to them and say, ‘I’m here for you. I got you, I’m on your side. What are your needs? We’ll get through this together,” she said. <br>For more information on the Office of Victim Assistance Services, please see [this post](https://fb.watch/4tDyyRC5eG/) on the Public Safety Facebook Page. | 26/3/2021 09:34:04 |

| Pittsburgh Police Address Increase in Violence in the City | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 19, 2021) -- The recent surge in violent crime in the City of Pittsburgh is causing concern and even fear among some residents. Pittsburgh Police share that concern, especially as many of the victims of these crimes have been young people. <br>So far this year, there have been 20 homicides in the City and close to 50 non-fatal shootings, marking 80% and 90% increases respectively from the same time last year.<br>Pittsburgh is not alone in dealing with this, as the escalation of violent crime is currently a national phenomenon. <br>"Although this uptick in violence appears to be a trend across the country, this is not our city. This is not Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will not allow this senseless loss of life to continue. Our officers will work directly with the community to get to the root cause of these crimes and stop them from occurring," Police Chief Scott Schubert said.<br>Police have been taking a proactive approach to address the violence in the most affected neighborhoods. Community Resource Officers (CROs) and Neighborhood Resource Officers (NROs) from the Community Engagement Office have been walking through several communities each week, speaking with residents and business owners, listening to concerns and sharing ideas about ways to make their communities safer. <br>Group Violence Intervention (GVI) outreach workers have also stepped up their presence. GVI is a partnership between law enforcement, outreach, social services and the faith community who mediate and interrupt violence.<br>"Public Safety will ensure police have the investigative tools, technology, and resources they need at this time. But, more importantly, we encourage members of the public to come forward and share their ideas, concerns, and information with police. Police can only solve crimes when everyone works together. That cooperation and collaboration is key," says Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich.<br>Anyone with information about these violent crimes is asked to call Pittsburgh Police at (412) 323-7800. | 18/4/2021 15:56:21 |
| Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert on the Verdict in Derek Chauvin Trial | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 20, 2021) -- Pittsburgh, and indeed the whole world, closely watched the trial of former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin in wake of the in-custody death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020.<br>Today, a jury found Mr.Chauvin guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.<br>"As police officers, we have a fundamental duty to care for and safeguard everyone and anyone in our custody. That did not occur. A man was deprived of his life, a family was deprived of their loved one, a community was deprived of their faith in the people who are entrusted to keep them safe," said Police Chief Scott Schubert.<br>George Floyd's death sparked some of the largest civil rights protests in decades and shone a spotlight on police accountability and reform.<br>"The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police recognizes that our legitimacy is highly dependent on the mutual trust and respect we have with the communities we serve. Law enforcement is always evolving and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police remains steadfast in its commitment to working hand in hand with the public to implement professional law enforcement services that are fair, equitable, transparent and procedurally just to all members of the community," said Schubert. | 20/4/2021 20:18:25 |

Between the global pandemic, civil unrest, calls for social justice reform and a tumultuous presidential election, it made for one of the most challenging years I've experienced in my 27 years as a member of the PBP. But every challenge provides an opportunity. I believe we have an opportunity now to reevaluate and reconfigure how we think and operate as an organization and profession. We embrace this opportunity," said Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert.<br>The report includes statistics compiled by the Crime Analysis Unit on everything from the distribution of personnel based on rank, gender, and race, to information on arrests and citations, to crime statistics by neighborhood.<br>Chief Schubert also acknowledged the Bureau’s ongoing commitment to establishing strong ties with each and every community in the City, even walking a beat in all of Pittsburgh's 90 neighborhoods and encouraging his officers to do the same. Officers with the Community Engagement Office, under the direction of Chief Schubert, are now literally following in his footsteps with weekly walks in different communities.<br>"I am a firm believer in relational policing and the positive impact it has on our personnel and the community. We recognize that our legitimacy largely depends on a mutual trust and respect between police and the communities we serve. For that reason and others, the PBP will continue to implement relational policing into everything we do," said Schubert. <br>Most importantly the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police remains more committed than ever to providing transparency, building relationships and defining and scaling success within the Bureau based on the doctrine of 21st Century Policing.<br>“Behind the numbers in this report are the hundreds of dedicated men and women who make up the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.

| Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Partners with Duquesne Light Company on Hazardous Materials Safety Training Initiative | PITTSBURGH, PA, (June 10, 2021) – June is National Safety Month and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire is pleased to announce an exciting new partnership with Duquesne Light Company (DLC) to provide our Hazardous Materials Response Team (HazMat) with an innovative training tool to learn safe containment of chemical and fuel spills from highway tank trailers.  <br>The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire replicates hazardous materials spills for HazMat technicians with a highway trailer training prop at its facility on Washington Boulevard. Now, a critical assist from Duquesne Light's hydraulic service truck and mechanics, will help provide a “real-life” experience for first responders who encounter a tanker rollover emergency. <br>“We are now able to position this prop to simulate a rollover of a tank or fuel trailer in transit. If a transportation emergency occurs, we can arrive and it’s in a variety of different configurations or positions. This one-of-a-kind training prop gives our team the opportunity to practice on a real-life, hands-on tool,” said Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Assistant Chief Brian Kokkila. “Duquesne Light is uniquely positioned with the equipment and expertise in hydraulic systems. We were able to ask for their help to power the hydraulic system and they really stepped up and helped us solve some challenges.”  <br>The simulator is set up with multiple different leak spots to ensure the HazMat team is presented with the most authentic scenarios to better prepare them for emergencies in the field. <br>“When the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire approached us about this partnership, we jumped at the opportunity. We were honored that they came to us knowing we have the right skills and equipment to do the job safely and effectively. With the help of our mechanics and hydraulic service truck, we were able to successfully complete the rollover and enable the firefighters to begin their critical training. We’re grateful for the chance to support this effort and the positive impact it will have on the community, said Chuck O’Neill, DLC's Transportation Manager."   <br>The HazMat team responds to emergencies involving the release or potential release of hazardous material. It is a National Incident Management System (NIMS) Type 2 - Hazardous Materials Response Team certified by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency.<br>“Safety is always the top priority at DLC. With June being National Safety Month, it’s an ideal time to recognize our longstanding relationship with the City of Pittsburgh and our efforts to keep our customers and the public safe. We look forward to growing this partnership in the future and reinforcing our commitment to maintaining a safe community," said Kevin Walker, Chief Operating Officer, DLC. <br>The City of Pittsburgh Hazardous Materials Response Team was established in 1986 as a joint effort between the Bureau of Fire and the Bureau of EMS. The team is comprised of Firefighters, Paramedics and Police Officers.   <br>Watch the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2vCvGXv\_j0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2vCvGXv_j0)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14533_HAZMAT_Setup-01.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14536_HAZMAT_Setup-05.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14537_HAZMAT_Setup-06.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14535_HAZMAT_Setup-04.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14539_HAZMAT_Setup-10.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14542_HAZMAT_Setup-14.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14546_HAZMAT_Setup-20.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14570_HAZMAT_Setup-21.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14571_HAZMAT_Training_2nd_Visit-03.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14581_HAZMAT_Training_2nd_Visit-08.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14582_HAZMAT_Training_2nd_Visit-09.jpg) | 26/5/2021 15:48:14 |

Officers meet with community members, hear concerns and ideas on how to minimize crime and violence, and form vital relationships with children and youth.<br>Unfortunately many of the planned walks and events were postponed due to more inclement weather than usual, but officers met with as many community members as possible during the week of June 7 to June 13.<br>The weekly Chess with Cops meet-ups in Market Square are still going strong. In fact, the event's popularity has even reached out-of-state chess aficionados.  This past Tuesday, the Seguin family traveled from Charlotte, NC, not only to visit relatives in Shadyside, but also so their daughter Sydney, age 7 and son Baxter, age 5, could play chess with officers. Turns out, much to Officer Washington's surprise, that Baxter is a bit of a prodigy. <br>Wednesday was a ribbon-cutting ceremony Officer Shifren attended to open a new dek hockey rink in Lincoln Place. Generous support from the Pittsburgh Penguins helped make the rink a reality. Also on Wednesday, CEO officers participated in a Stop the Violence prayer vigil at Lighthouse Cathedral with Reverend Porter. This event was hosted by South Pittsburgh Coalition for Peace.<br>And finally, thanks to a collaboration between Community Engagement officers and members of the Mount Washington Community Development Corporation, some big improvements are planned for the Shiloh Parklet on Shiloh Street. <br>The Community Engagement Office welcomes all suggestions and opportunities to meet with its officers.

| Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris to Visit Pittsburgh on Monday, June 21, 2021 | PITTSBURGH, PA, (June 20, 2021) -- The Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, will be visiting the City of Pittsburgh on Monday, June 21, 2021.<br>In preparation for the Vice Presidential visit, Public Safety would like to inform residents that certain streets will be closed completely, while others will experience rolling closures as the motorcade moves around the City. Motorists should expect delays and detours in some areas.<br>E. Carson Street between S.28th Street and Sarah Street will be shut down from approximately 12 p.m. until 4:30 p.m.<br>"The public should pack a measure of patience, have an alternative route or routes in mind, and expect traffic delays as the Vice President's motorcade travels through the City on Monday," said Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Commander, Eric Holmes.<br>Public Safety will inform residents via social media when the motorcade has passed and the streets have reopened. | 20/6/2021 08:07:10 |
| Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Encourages Safe Swimming with Youth Life Vest Giveaway | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 21, 2021)  -- Members from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (EMS), Citiparks, and the Office of Community Health and Safety will be distributing youth-sized personal flotation devices (life vests) and safe swimming information packets to youth and parents at three of the City’s [summer lunch grab-and-go locations](https://pittsburghpa.gov/citiparks/summer-food-service-program) on Wednesday, June 23. <br>The Safe Swim initiative, led by EMS, aims to increase swimming and water safety throughout the City of Pittsburgh. The initiative began last summer in response to the widespread closures of community pools due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased the possibility of children and youth swimming in less-supervised settings, such as backyard pools or open water. <br>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after motor vehicle crashes, drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional injury death among children ages 1-14. There is an additional racial disparity, as Black children ages 10-14 years drown at rates 7.6 times higher than other children.   <br>Thanks to a donation of youth-sized personal flotation devices from Allegheny Health Network and Highmark, the initiative will provide the free life vests and educational materials to encourage children and parents to adopt safe swimming practices this summer.  <br>The life vests will be available at the Mellon, Beechview, and Troy Hill [spray parks](https://pittsburghpa.gov/citiparks/spray-park) from 9:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. | 21/6/2021 11:06:19 |
| Fireworks Task Force Begins Enforcement Initiative | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 22, 2021) – It’s no secret that Pittsburghers love their fireworks. From Pirates games to Independence Day at Point State Park, elaborate fireworks displays are a time worn tradition in the City. <br>Consumer-grade fireworks became legal to purchase in Pennsylvania in October 2017, resulting in a sharp annual increase in fireworks-related calls for service in the City of Pittsburgh.  <br>Last year, private use of fireworks in Pittsburgh resulted in seven structure fires, several brush fires, reported injuries, and multiple noise complaints. The Fireworks Task force handed out 22 citations. <br>Beginning tonight, June 22, the Fireworks Task Force (FTF) will be out in all zones beginning at 7 p.m. until 2 a.m. every night until July 5.  <br>Although fireworks may now be legal to purchase, it is not legal to discharge them within 150 feet of a structure. They are also not permitted for use in any City park, ball field, or any City-owned property. <br>When Fireworks Task Force members and uniformed police officers respond to initial fireworks-related complaints they will explain the laws and regulations governing consumer fireworks in the City. Subsequent calls to the same address could result in a $100 citation and confiscation of the fireworks. <br>“The use of fireworks in the City can result in serious injuries and destruction of properties, as well as being very disruptive and unnerving for both people and pets,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. “That’s why this year, in a concerted effort to keep everyone safe, we will also be utilizing the City’s Shotspotter system to help track illegal fireworks use.” <br>The Fireworks Task Force is comprised of eight members from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. | 22/6/2021 17:27:10 |
| Pittsburgh Police to Conduct Abandoned Vehicle Blitz in Homewood on Wednesday, June 23 | PITTSBURGH, PA (June 22, 2021) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will be conducting another blitz on abandoned vehicles in the City.<br>On Wednesday, June 23, motorcycle units and abandoned vehicle officers from multiple police zones will focus on citizen complaints regarding abandoned vehicles in the Homewood neighborhood beginning at 10 a.m.<br>The first blitz at the end of April focused on the Allentown, Beltzhoover, Carrick, Arlington Heights and Knoxville neighborhoods. Police investigated 124 complaints and towed 17 vehicles.  <br>Police will repeat the blitzes throughout the city in the coming weeks and months to clear as many 311 complaints as possible. <br>Residents may report abandoned vehicles to the 311 Response Center by calling 311, 412-255-2621, or by filing [an online 311 Request Form](https://pittsburghpa.gov/311/form). | 21/6/2021 16:58:19 |
| Pittsburgh Police, ATF, Community Partners, and Families of Victims Address Spike in Gun Violence in Pittsburgh | (PITTSBURGH, PA) --  The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police today addressed the marked escalation in the number of homicides and non-fatal shooting incidents in the City of Pittsburgh this year.<br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, members of Police command staff, Gun Violence Intervention (GVI), representatives from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Community Outreach members, and families of gun violence victims gathered at the Center for Victims on E. Carson Street.<br>Year-to-date there have been 31 homicides, compared with 20 homicides at the same time in 2020. There have been 76 non-fatal shootings since January.<br>"I'm tired of going out to scenes and seeing families and communities grieving," said Director Hissrich. "It's going to be a long fight and it's going to be a a very hard summer for us, but I'm sure with the help of our communities and our partners, that we'll end what we're facing."<br>Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert made an impassioned plea for the violence to stop, referencing recent cases of homicides and non-fatal shootings involving young people, including a teenager shot multiple times and killed just steps from his family home, and a six-year-old girl shot and wounded in a car.<br>“There's so many guns on the street. No community, no zone in the City of Pittsburgh is immune. We're losing our loved ones to the senseless violence," said Chief Schubert. "This stuff has got to stop. We're going to use every partner we have to make sure that happens and we're going to work as a team. But I implore you, we need the community to help us. We cannot do this alone. We have to do it together."<br>Matthew Varisco, ATF Special Agent in Charge from the Philadelphia Field Division, provided a snapshot of the guns used in crimes in Pittsburgh.<br>"Of the firearms that were recovered and traced, the vast majority were pistols and they were recovered unfortunately from felons, " said Varisco. He added that approximately 75% of those firearms were purchased in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and that Pittsburgh Police are on pace to recover as many as 800 firearms this year. <br>The ATF is creating a firearms trafficking unit in Pittsburgh, assigning two of its agents to work with Pittsburgh Police to help stem the flow of illegal guns in the city and reduce gun violence.<br>Assistant Chief of Police Lavonnie Bickerstaff pointed to some of the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic posed in trying to support and provide resources to young people and keep them from resolving disputes with firearms.<br>"During the pandemic, our violence prevention strategy, which has proven to be successful over the last four to five years, has been hampered to a degree because of our inability to have face-to- face contact with our young people. We were restricted from our custom notifications, we were restricted from hospital visits after shootings. We did not have the support and the mediation that we normally have from our coaches, from our teachers that help to calm down disputes before people pick up a gun and, of course, our recreation centers were closed," Bickerstaff said, adding that Police and Community Outreach workers had to retool their supportive efforts and find healthy ways to provide resources to the neighborhoods they serve.<br>Valerie Dixon and Preeti Tuli, two mothers who lost their sons to gun violence twenty years apart, spoke about the lasting pain and the trauma caused by gun violence.<br>Tuli's 18-year-old son Ahmir was murdered in February outside of her Strip District business. <br>"He was a good kid. He didn't deserve it. None of these kids do," said Tuli. "We really need to come together. People need to start talking. There's tip lines. You can remain anonymous."<br>Valerie Dixon's son Robert was shot and killed on Friday, June 25, 2001 in Lincoln-Lemington.<br>"Twenty years later that pain is still the same. Twenty years later my friends now are people who are interrupters. People who want to stop the violence, people who work with victims. I have a whole new set of friends who have helped me heal over the years because the pain never goes," said Dixon.<br>Pittsburgh Police are increasing patrols in active areas and will continue focusing on deterrence measures in an effort to curb gun violence. Anyone with information about a violent crime is urged to call Pittsburgh Police at (412) 323-7800. | 24/6/2021 15:37:31 |

| A Message from Pittsburgh Public Safety Ahead of the Fourth of July Celebrations | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2021) --- After muted Independence Day celebrations in the City last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pittsburgh is set to mark the Fourth of July with fanfare this coming weekend.<br>The City-sponsored fireworks display is back with the City of Pittsburgh’s 2021 Independence Day Celebration in Point State Park on Sunday, July 4. The celebration and activities leading up to the main event are sure to draw large crowds to the Downtown core.<br>In preparation, Pittsburgh Police are working with their local law enforcement partners, Community Engagement officers, and Community Outreach members in an effort to keep everyone safe this holiday.<br>“We expect this to be one of the busiest nights of the year with people eager to celebrate after a challenging time. We are all looking forward to getting back to some semblance of normalcy, but Public Safety’s primary focus will always be to protect residents and visitors so they can safely enjoy Independence Day with their families and friends,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich.<br>"Schubert quote??"<br>“To that end, there will be increased lighting in key locations Downtown. Pittsburgh Police and Allegheny County Mounted Units will be in place to ensure crowds keep moving so there are clear ingress and egress points for first responders to reach people should an emergency occur.”<br>State Police will also be paying close attention to the Fort Pitt and Fort Duquesne bridges which are popular vantage points to watch the fireworks display. For everyone’s safety, police will ensure vehicle traffic keeps flowing on the bridge decks.<br>Motorcycle medics with the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS will be operating at various points Downtown to more easily reach and treat patients in crowded areas.<br>Traditional medic units will also stage near key fireworks viewing points on Mount Washington, the North Side, and Downtown.<br>One of the things they will be watching out for is heat-related ailments. Temperatures are forecast to be in the high 70’s with high humidity and a 40% chance of precipitation on Independence Day.<br>Dr. Donald Yealy, Chief Medical Officer with UPMC, says the most important thing to remember is that everyone’s body is a heat generator and we have to learn how to dissipate, or get rid of heat.<br>“Things that either increase the amount of heat we are making or decrease our ability to get rid of the heat will put us at risk for having a complication, whether that is heat exhaustion or heat stroke,” says Yealy.<br>“We become dehydrated from not drinking enough fluids or drinking the wrong fluids… alcohol is the wrong fluid as it goes out quickly. Certain medications can make us prone to either dehydration or less responsive to heat stresses. Those are things that either make us lose fluids or impair our ability to respond to heat.”  <br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich would like to remind people of another hot weather danger.<br>“Forgetting children in the back of hot vehicles is more common than most people might imagine and the results can be tragic. Leaving a window open even a crack is not enough. Temperatures inside a vehicle can rise by 20 degrees within 10 minutes even with a window open, putting children at risk for heat stroke and even death. The same is true for pets. Please remember to look before you lock,” Hissrich said.<br>Due to a dramatic surge in fireworks complaints last year, Public Safety formed a Fireworks Taskforce to patrol city neighborhoods and respond to complaints of those using fireworks illegally. The Fireworks Taskforce will continue its nightly enforcement efforts until July 5.<br>"Chief Jones quote???"<br>“The challenge about using even consumer-grade fireworks is that they are miniature explosives or flame-inducing events. So, you have the risk of not only the blast injury, but also of heat injuries and with the case of sparklers, the flecks that come from this. So people have to be careful because often fireworks are being used in a celebratory setting, which means there sometimes alcohol or other forms of impaired judgment. That just multiplies the risk. These things can kill you. They can hurt your fingers or extremities. They can hurt people nearby and even occasionally, there’s ocular injuries from the explosion or sediment out there. Every year we see someone with a  serious injury due to mishandling of fireworks.”<br>And finally, Dr. Yealy would like to remind people that the pandemic is not over. Even though the activities are primarily outdoors, the virus still poses a risk to those who are not inoculated with one of CDC-approved COVID-19 vaccines.<br>“This will always involve a certain amount of congregation. That’s what people do during holidays. If you’re fully vaccinated, that’s not a concern. But if you’re not, please wear that mask. The COVID-19 virus is still here with us,” says Yealy.<br>For more information on the City of Pittsburgh Independence Day Celebration: https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/5043<br>For more information on the Fireworks Task Force, follow this link to the press release: https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=5039 | 29/6/2021 17:11:35 |
| Pittsburgh Police Enhance Safety and Security Measures in the South Side Business District | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2021) --- As COVID-19 mitigation measures continue to be lifted and businesses are back to full occupancy, large numbers of young people have returned to the South Side on the weekends and evenings to patronize the area's many bars and restaurants.  <br>On East Carson Street, the increased volume of people has resulted in nearly impassable sidewalks, pedestrians flowing into the road amid traffic, and parked vehicles blocking safety lanes. There have also been fistfights, pedestrians struck by vehicles, and incidents of gun violence.  <br>“While we are glad that Pittsburgh is returning to some semblance of normalcy since the height of the pandemic, the situation on the South Side has become dangerous and untenable,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. “First responder vehicles must have access to East Carson in case of an emergency and overcrowded sidewalks pose hazards to pedestrians who then spill onto the streets and into vehicle traffic. Without changes, someone is going to get seriously hurt or killed.” <br>In response, beginning Friday, July 2, 2021 and going forward, Pittsburgh Police will first be issuing warnings and then citations to those who obstruct public passageways. If violators fail to comply, there may be physical arrests. The citations could carry penalties of up to $300, plus court costs.<br>Police motorcycle and bicycle units will also be in place to enforce parking. All vehicles in violation of the posted measures will be towed. <br>Public Safety encourages everyone to celebrate safely on the South Side, and throughout the City of Pittsburgh, and we wish you a happy and safe Fourth of July holiday weekend. | 1/7/2021 13:04:25 |

The family-friendly celebration and activities leading up to the main event are sure to draw large crowds to the Downtown core.<br>In preparation, Pittsburgh Police, Allegheny County Police, Pennsylvania State Police, Port Authority Police, Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Officers, and the Street Outreach team will be working together to keep everyone safe this holiday weekend.<br>“We expect this to be one of the busiest nights of the year with people eager to gather together after a challenging time. We are all looking forward to celebrating in true Pittsburgh style with a grand fireworks display, but Public Safety’s primary focus will always be to protect residents and visitors so they can safely enjoy Independence Day with their families and friends,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich.<br>“To that end, there will be more than a dozen mobile light towers at key locations to increase visibility Downtown. The Pittsburgh Police, PA State Police, and Allegheny County Mounted Units will be activated to ensure crowds keep moving, allowing first responders to reach people should an emergency occur.”<br>The City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Police will not allow violence and unruly revelers to ruin what should be a safe event. Fights and violence of any kind will not be tolerated. Point State Park Rangers and Pittsburgh Police will be doing light bag screenings at the Park’s entrances. The list of prohibited items can be found on the event website: [https://pittsburghpa.gov/july4/](http://https//pittsburghpa.gov/july4/)<br>The fireworks are scheduled to end at 10 p.m. and police will be working closely with Port Authority personnel to move people out of the downtown core as quickly as possible to decrease some of the past problems related to overcrowding in some areas at the end of the evening. Riders are strongly encouraged to check schedules in advance as some bus and rail routes do not operate, and most service ends early, on Sundays. Schedules can be found at [www.portauthority.org/all-schedules](http://www.portauthority.org/all-schedules).<br>Bridges are often popular vantage points for vehicles to stop and watch the fireworks. A Pennsylvania State Police helicopter will monitor from overhead to ensure traffic keeps flowing on the bridge decks, reducing congestion and the possibility for collisions.<br>Two River Rescue boats with Pittsburgh EMS, Police, and Fire personnel on board will be out on the rivers. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire boat will also be on the water with three firefighters.<br>It should also be noted that the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural resources will close the Point State Park wharves to boat mooring on the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers on Sunday, July 4.  <br>Motorcycle medic units with the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS will be operating near the various viewing points in the City to more easily reach and treat patients in crowded areas.<br>Traditional medic units will also stage near key fireworks viewing points on Mount Washington, the North Side, and Downtown.<br>One of the things they will be watching out for is heat-related ailments. Temperatures are forecast to be in the 80’s with mostly sunny skies on Independence Day.<br>Dr. Donald Yealy, Chief Medical Officer with UPMC, says the most important thing to remember is that everyone’s body is a heat generator and we have to learn how to dissipate, or get rid of heat.<br>“Things that either increase the amount of heat we are making or decrease our ability to get rid of the heat will put us at risk for having a complication, whether that is heat exhaustion or heat stroke,” says Yealy.<br>“We become dehydrated from not drinking enough fluids or drinking the wrong fluids…alcohol is the wrong fluid as it goes out quickly. Certain medications can make us prone to either dehydration or less responsive to heat stresses. Those are things that either make us lose fluids or impair our ability to respond to heat.” <br>The Public Safety Director would also like to remind people of the dangers that consumer grade fireworks pose.<br>“Although sales of consumer fireworks are legal, they remain a fire hazard and a safety concern. As a reminder, fireworks are not allowed in Point State Park or any City park. In addition, the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, are prohibited within 150 feet of any structure,” said Hissrich.<br>“And please, remember your pets. Fireworks can startle pets, which are more sensitive to loud noises and flashing lights, sometimes causing them to run away or hide.”<br>In an effort to curb the illegal use of fireworks, the Fireworks Task Force will continue with its enforcement efforts until July 5.<br>And finally, although the situation has vastly improved, the pandemic is not over. Those who are not vaccinated are strongly encouraged to wear a mask. Even though Sunday's activities are primarily outdoors, the virus still poses a risk to those who are not inoculated with one of CDC-approved, COVID-19 vaccines.<br>“This weekend will always involve a certain amount of congregation. That’s what people do during holidays. If you’re fully vaccinated, that’s not a concern. But if you’re not, please wear that mask.

Temperatures are forecast to be in the 80’s with mostly sunny skies on Independence Day.<br>Dr. Donald Yealy, Chief Medical Officer with UPMC, says the most important thing to remember is that everyone’s body is a heat generator and we have to learn how to dissipate, or get rid of heat.<br>“Things that either increase the amount of heat we are making or decrease our ability to get rid of the heat will put us at risk for having a complication, whether that is heat exhaustion or heat stroke,” says Yealy.<br>“We become dehydrated from not drinking enough fluids or drinking the wrong fluids… alcohol is the wrong fluid as it goes out quickly. Certain medications can make us prone to either dehydration or less responsive to heat stresses. Those are things that either make us lose fluids or impair our ability to respond to heat.” <br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich would like to remind people of another hot weather danger.<br>“Forgetting children in the back of hot vehicles is more common than most people might imagine and the results can be tragic. Leaving a window open even a crack is not enough. Temperatures inside a vehicle can rise by 20 degrees within 10 minutes eve nwith a window open, putting children at risk for heat stroke and even death. The same is true for pets. Please remember to look before you lock,” Hissrich said.<br>And finally, although the situation has vastly improved, the pandemic is not over. Those who are not vaccinated are strongly encouraged to wear a mask. Even though the activities are primarily outdoors, the virus still poses a risk to those who are not inoculated with one of CDC-approved COVID-19 vaccines.<br>“This will always involve a certain amount of congregation. That’s what people do during holidays. If you’re fully vaccinated, that’s not a concern. But if you’re not, please wear that mask. The COVID-19 virus is still here with us,” says Yealy.<br>From everyone at Public Safety, please enjoy this Independence <br>For more information on the City of Pittsburgh Independence Day Celebration: https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/5043<br>For more information on the Fireworks Task Force, follow this link to the press release: https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=5039 | 1/7/2021 16:20:21 |

| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Partners with Books Bridge Hope to Assist Unsheltered Communities | PITTSBURGH, PA (July 8, 2021) – When Lillie Leonardi, a 26-year veteran of law enforcement and former FBI Community Affairs Coordinator, lost her job and livelihood after being diagnosed with PTSD, she turned to intensive therapy, meditation, journaling, and reading books.<br>A 9/11 first responder at the Flight 93 crash site in Shanksville, PA, books helped her heal and ultimately guided her toward a new career as an independent speaker, publisher, and founder of _Passages & Prose, LLC_ and its non-profit subsidiary, Books Bridge Hope.<br>“A wonderful life turned upside down by an unexpected, traumatic event…it’s a common story among the unsheltered community, but it could be anyone’s story,” Leonardi explains.<br>“Through my community service work, past and present, I began to see that I had common ground with the homeless. I lost my job due to mental health issues. My fear was insurmountable. I couldn’t function well. That is the genesis of “Box of Goodness.”<br>Since its launch in May of this year, Books Bridge Hope has distributed more than 50 boxes of goodness in partnership with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and its 25-member-strong team of Community Engagement officers. Officers now have the boxes in their vehicles to hand out to people where needed. <br>“It’s an unfortunate reality, but Pittsburgh Police encounter our unsheltered community members throughout the City every single day, many of whom our officers know by name and try to assist with their differing and varying needs. But, sometimes receiving a gift; a surprise box full of items that lift a person’s soul and makes them smile, is just as important as helping provide some of the other critical care and assistance people need. That’s why the Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office jumped at the chance to partner with Books Bridge Hope – because that’s exactly what they do; they provide hope to those who need it most,” said Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa of the Community Engagement Office.<br>Leonardi, who has personally funded the initiative since its inception, also works with an impassioned network of volunteers who help source and assemble contents for each box. Each Box of Goodness is filled to the brim with books, magazines, and writing supplies in direct response to countless requests for reading materials that help fill the long, empty hours on the street or in a shelter. Warm socks, toiletries and non-perishable food are also included.<br>“This initiative not only provides compassionate care to the unsheltered community during these unprecedented times, but also allows law enforcement, the Books Bridge Hope Board of Directors, community collaborators, and volunteers to bring forth their best efforts in service to others," said Leonardi.<br>To learn more about **Books Bridge Hope** and its **Box of Goodness** initiative, visit [**passagesandprose.com/pages/books-bridge-hope**](http://passagesandprose.com/pages/books-bridge-hope) or contact founder, Lillie Leonardi, at [authorlillieleonardi@gmail.com](mailto:authorlillieleonardi@gmail.com)<br>To contact the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Community Engagement Office, email Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa at tiffany.kline-costa@pittsburghpa.gov.<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14671_174145283_2872892252949607_1805282372716545960_n.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14666_IMG_4895.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14667_IMG_4898.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14668_FullSizeRender.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/14669_IMG_4897.jpg) | 17/6/2021 13:18:40 |
| Department of Public Safety Makes Modifications to South Side Vehicle Traffic Pilot Project | PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 12, 2021) -- In recent weeks, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety implemented a pilot project on the South Side to address mounting concerns regarding overcrowding, increased violence, and pedestrian safety on and around East Carson Street. <br>The primary intent of the plan has been to stem the flow of vehicle traffic into the commercial corridor to alleviate some of the density in the area during the busiest evening hours on the weekends. <br>While the strategy has been largely successful in helping to prevent violence and congestion on East Carson Street, Public Safety has remained in ongoing discussion with business owners who have asked for slight adjustments to ensure ease of access to restaurants and retail stores in the early evening hours.  <br>With that in mind, Public Safety is making modifications to the times of day during which the measures will be implemented. <br>Beginning **at 9:30 p.m.** on Fridays and Saturdays, East Carson Street will convert from two-way to one-way traffic traveling eastbound (outbound) between S. 10th and S. 18th. The previous start time was 7:00 p.m.   <br>On Fridays and Saturdays, 'No Parking' measures will be strictly enforced on these blocks of East Carson Street starting at **8 p.m**., including the towing of vehicles, to keep this stretch clear for Public Safety vehicle access. Signage along East Carson will be clearly marked to reflect the altered parking hours for these days. <br>Side streets from S.11th to S.17th will remain open to through-traffic until 9:30 p.m., at which time vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. In previous weeks, the side streets were closed at 7:00 p.m. <br>"The only way to ensure the South Side will remain safe and accessible to everyone will be to continue to engage in communication with residents and business owners, working together and truly listening to their needs, balanced with the overall goal of preventing violence. That dialogue will be open and ongoing, and we continue to thank everyone for their patience and cooperation," said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. <br>The pilot project in the South Side will remain in effect for the near future and Public Safety will continue to monitor its impact and effectiveness. | 12/8/2021 12:41:47 |
| Public Safety Temporarily Pauses South Side Traffic Pilot During Building Demolition | PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 13, 2021) -- Due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson Street last night, Public Safety is temporarily halting its traffic calming pilot project.<br>The upper level of a two-story building sustained severe damage during heavy rainstorms and engineers are concerned the integrity of the structure, and that of the adjacent buildings, may be compromised.<br>As such, Public Safety will be closing E. Carson Street between S.16th and S.17th streets to begin the demolition of 1604 E. Carson. A large crane has been staged in the street to begin that process. During this time, traffic will be diverted around this block. Tractor trailers and longer industrial-type vehicles will need to divert via the 10th Street Bridge or the Birmingham Bridge.<br>As stated earlier, the traffic pilot project implemented on July 30 will **NOT** be in place for the time being. <br>Some businesses on this block will be impacted during the demolition. There is no timeline for its completion. This is an evolving situation and Public Safety will provide information to the public as it becomes available. <br>Public Safety would like to thank residents, business owners, and visitors to Pittsburgh for their patience and understanding with these last minute changes and the inconvenience they may cause. | 13/8/2021 15:34:21 |

All of the backpacks were handed out during the popular drive-up event and more than 600 masks were distributed.<br>Earlier in the week, Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa and CEO officers spoke with children at Homewood YMCA about how to prepare and protect themselves in the event of an active shooter incident in their school.<br>“Obviously police do not want to worry or scare young children, but we want them to have the tools and the knowledge to protect themselves and their classmates should such an incident occur. We tell them it’s much like doing regular fire drills to prepare for the possibility of a fire. It’s not likely to happen, but if does, they will know exactly what to do,” said Sergeant Kline-Costa.<br>And finally, the Chess with Cops event in Market Square continues to draw new players every Tuesday and, as these photos demonstrate, the game doesn’t have to be a serious and somber affair!<br>If you have an event you’d like the Community Engagement Office to participate in or an idea you’d like to share, please contact Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa at [tiffany.kline-costa@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:tiffany.kline-costa@pittsburghpa.gov).<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15427_Image_(22).jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15426_Image_(21).jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15429_Image_(23).jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15430_Image_(24).jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15431_Image_(25).jpeg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15425_IMG_1025.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15424_8.17.21_market_sq_chess_handshake.jpg) | 20/8/2021 15:35:36 |

Signage along East Carson will be clearly marked to reflect the altered parking hours for these days. <br>Side streets from S.11th to S.17th will remain open to through-traffic until 9:30 p.m., at which time vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. In previous weeks, the side streets were closed at 7:00 p.m. <br>The pilot project on the South Side will remain in effect for the near future and Public Safety will continue to monitor its impact and effectiveness. | 25/8/2021 15:06:42 |

These first responders play a vital role in the continuum of care for cardiac and stroke patients, and they continue to expand on their skills and training daily,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. <br>Each year more than 250,000 people experience a STEMI heart attack and Pittsburgh EMS is uniquely qualified to provide optimal care for patients from the first 9-1-1 call, to treatment and transport, through to coordination with the healthcare system. <br>“I am proud to work with our outstanding team of Emergency Medical Services caregivers who continue to provide the most up-to-date treatment to improve patient care and positive outcomes for Pittsburgh’s residents and visitors who experience cardiac emergencies,” said Ronald Romano, Chief of Pittsburgh EMS. <br>The American Heart Association’s Mission: Lifeline EMS program helps reduce barriers to prompt treatment for heart attacks.  <br>“While the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to pose unique challenges with infected patients and the increased burden of additional personal protective equipment for first responders, Pittsburgh EMS Paramedics and EMTs have never wavered in their quality of care for cardiac care patients, relying on the Mission: Lifeline EMS guidelines and knowledge and putting that into practice each and every day,” said Pittsburgh EMS Assistant Chief, Mark Pinchalk. <br>Congratulations Pittsburgh EMS! | 26/8/2021 13:22:56 |

| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and FBI Pittsburgh Investigate Threats to City Churches | PITTSBURGH, PA (September 14, 2021) – On the morning of Sunday, September 12, officers with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police were dispatched to two separate Catholic churches in the City of Pittsburgh after threats to harm congregants were received by telephone. <br>At the same time, parishioners at one of the churches, located on the North Side, called Police after one of their fellow congregants was observed to be carrying a gun on his person during the service. During their initial investigation, the man provided police with a valid conceal carry permit. It was determined that he did not commit a crime and was permitted to leave. <br>The other church that received a threat was in the Greenfield area of the City. When responding officers arrived, they secured the scene and established that there was no visible threat inside or outside of the church before the congregants were escorted to safety. <br>In response to these threats and perceived danger, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is working directly with the FBI to thoroughly investigate the source and determine any connection between the two incidents.  <br>"Pittsburgh Public Safety takes all threats of violence or terrorism extremely seriously. Pittsburgh Police Intelligence Unit detectives are working closely with our federal partners within FBI Pittsburgh, sharing information and intelligence to determine the origin of the threats. In the meantime, we are reassured that in one instance, citizens called Police when they observed suspicious behavior. We encourage everyone to adhere to the tenet, ‘if you see something, say something.’ It is only by working together that we can keep our communities safe,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. <br>Police have added extra patrols and are taking additional precautions to safeguard these churches and all houses of worship in the City of Pittsburgh. The Bureau does not discuss specific operational details.  <br>This investigation is very active and ongoing. Updates to the public will be provided when they become available. | 14/9/2021 12:49:19 |

Nearly 5% of children ages 12 to 17 have reported non-medical drug use over the past year, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.<br>Together with the Drug Enforcement Administration, Pittsburgh is working towards making the community safer, starting at home. <br>**On Saturday, October 23 from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m.**, Pittsburgh will participate in the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 21st Annual Prescription Drug Takeback Day.<br>In April, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police collected 34 boxes with a combined total weight of 672 pounds of prescription medications. <br>Nationally, 420 tons of expired or unused medications were collected at over 5,000 collection sites. <br>“Many people may not realize the proper disposal of unused or expired prescription drugs can actually save lives,” said Sergeant Rebecca Bassano, Pittsburgh Police Narcotics and Vice. “Dropping off pill bottles at a disposal location can prevent them from getting into the wrong hands.” <br>Expired or unused prescription drugs can be a public safety hazard leading to poisoning, accidental overdoses, or abuse.

| Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Promotes Three to District Chief, Crew Chiefs | PITTSBURGH, PA (November 29, 2021) - On Monday, November 29, the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS held a swearing-in and promotions ceremony in the Mayor’s conference room.<br>Jeffrey Tremel was promoted to district chief, while Nicholas Lawrence and Justin M. Miller were promoted and sworn in as crew chiefs.<br>EMS Chief Ronald Romano commended all three on their outstanding effort and dedication which earned them their distinguished titles within department leadership. <br>"I want to thank these three individuals for having the ambition to pursue these promotions, and to continue to be leaders in the Bureau of EMS now and in the future," said Romano. <br>Medical Director for the City of Pittsburgh Dr. Ronald Roth congratulated the chiefs, emphasizing the importance of leadership in a time of change. <br>“This is really a time where we need leaders,” said Roth. “We know that Pittsburgh EMS has a good moral compass. We know which direction we want to go. And with good leaders, we can make that happen.” <br>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich praised the strong leadership already provided by the incoming crew chiefs in stressful, often chaotic situations in the field. <br>“The crew chiefs are the ones that are making life and death decisions daily,” he said. <br>Hissrich also addressed the extensive career of Jeffrey Tremel, who has served over 32 years with Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS in the Ambulance and Rescue Divisions. Tremel also served as President of Local 1 of the Fraternal Association of Professional Paramedics.

I am so proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with you these past eight years,” said Peduto. “As we look at these promotions, we’re looking into the next ten years, because it’s going to be hard to find qualified leaders in order to be able to train a next generation. It’s going to be hard \[...\] to find people willing to put their lives at risk in order to help and serve others, and it will require a strong leadership in order to be able to make sure there are people out there to help to serve, and save, Pittsburghers.” <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16579_IMG_0277.JPG)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16580_IMG_0275.JPG)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16581_IMG_0272.JPG)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16577_IMG_0280.JPG)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16576_IMG_0282.JPG)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16575_IMG_0284.JPG)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/16583_IMG_0264.JPG) | 29/11/2021 17:00:06 |

| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Announces Policy and Procedural Changes Following Critical Incident | PITTSBURGH, PA, (December 21, 2021) – On Wednesday, October 13, 2021, Jim Rogers was placed in Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) custody after officers responded to a call in Bloomfield. The officer on scene deployed his Taser during the response. Following his arrest, Mr. Rogers was transported to Mercy Hospital by police, where he passed away the following day.  <br>Pursuant to policy, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police empaneled an internal Critical Incident Review Board (CIRB) to evaluate officers’ actions and gauge policy compliance. Additionally, the Allegheny County Police Department is independently investigating the incident with the full cooperation of the PBP. Over the course of two months, the CIRB has reviewed evidence including all available video, officer statements and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police general orders and training. The Board found that a series of procedural failures contributed to this tragic outcome.  <br>Eight Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers, including two supervisors, will face varying levels of discipline in accordance with the Fraternal Order of Police collective bargaining agreement. We are not permitted to discuss details of the disciplinary process. <br>In recent years, the City of Pittsburgh implemented several measures to ensure accountability, including mandatory de-escalation and implicit bias training for officers and participation in The National Initiative for Building Community Trust & Justice, which examines policy and aims to increase trust within our community.  However, it is clear more needs to be done.  <br>Therefore, the CIRB recommended the following policy and procedural changes:  <br>- Any use of force incident will require the presence of a supervisor on scene to complete a medical assessment and request appropriate personnel  <br>  <br>- Any incident involving the positive deployment of a Taser will require emergency medical services personnel to assess the patient  <br>  <br>- Pittsburgh Bureau of Police personnel will be retrained in accordance with established PBP Training Academy Duty to Intervene policy <br>  <br>- PBP will streamline its organizational review of Use of Force by both appropriate command staff and the Training Academy to expeditiously ensure policy compliance <br>  <br>“It is imperative that every critical incident is reviewed promptly,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. “By identifying the problem, it allows us to make corrections that are put into policy in a timely manner.” <br>Immediately following this incident, all sworn PBP officers were required to complete a Taser refresher course followed by an exam. This course is in addition to the yearly mandated Taser recertification requirement for all officers. <br>Further, the PBP will require its officers to become fully certified Emergency Medical Responders.  <br>The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police would like to express its most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Jim Rogers. We thank them for their patience in affording the CIRB the time and latitude to investigate the events that led up to his tragic death.  <br>“Jim Rogers will serve as a sober reminder of the tremendous responsibility all officers bear when they wear the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police badge. Every resident and visitor to the City of Pittsburgh is owed the highest standard of care when they are in the custody of Pittsburgh Police. In the case of Jim Rogers, we failed our fellow citizen. The disciplinary measures and procedural changes we are announcing today are intended to ensure a tragedy such as this never occurs again in the City of Pittsburgh,” said Police Chief, Scott Schubert. <br>Pittsburgh Public Safety will not be offering any further comment at this time. | 21/12/2021 15:53:14 |

| Public Safety Statement on First Night as Pittsburgh Welcomes 2022 | PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 30, 2021) – After a moderated “made-for-TV” format last year, Pittsburgh’s annual “First Night” returns to the streets and event venues of Pittsburgh to ring in 2022. <br>Dec. 31 traditionally draws tens of thousands of people to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Highmark First Night Pittsburgh celebrations at venues throughout Downtown. Last year, those crowds stayed home due to pandemic concerns, but this year organizers are adapting the event again by moving much of it outdoors. <br>Of course, COVID-19 is still at the forefront of many minds, given the emergence of the Omicron variant. This year, there are some new requirements to keep crowds safe. Proof of vaccination, a valid ID and a mask are required for admission at any indoor venue. <br>“There are ways to both stay safe and have fun,” said Medical Director for the City of Pittsburgh Dr. Ronald Roth. “Even if you are fully vaccinated, wear a proper mask when inside or outside if you will be within close proximity of others from outside your own household.” <br>Further, a proper fitting, three-layer surgical-type mask is a better choice than a cloth mask. As always, proper social distancing is suggested where possible. <br>First Night is a long-standing family-friendly tradition and members of the Pittsburgh Police and Public Safety will be on-hand to help ensure residents and visitors are able to celebrate in a safe environment. <br>“As always, we encourage people to celebrate responsibly,” said PBP Police Chief Scott Schubert. “Public Safety officials will be highly visible and we encourage participants to engage with our personnel if they are in need of assistance or directions. Safety is everyone’s responsibility, so if you see something, say something!” <br>As a reminder, Police urge people to never drink and drive. Use public transportation or Uber, Lyft and designated drivers. Police will actively be looking for impaired drivers throughout the night. <br>For more information on First Night celebrations, go to firstnightpgh.trustarts.org. | 30/12/2021 12:01:46 |

The Bureau itself boasts firefighters from diverse backgrounds, including former chefs, police officers, scientists, paramedics, and more –  which works well to prepare them for the unique challenges of firefighting. <br>“Firefighters today are expected to respond to everything from fire alarms to structure fires, medical emergencies to hazardous materials situations, from swift water rescues to vehicle extrication,” said President of Pittsburgh Fire Fighters IAFF Local No. 1 Ralph Sicuro . “And remember, firefighting is still one of the few professions that makes house calls.”<br>In addition to the experience they already bring to the table, recruits endure an intensive, 32 week program to prepare them for the hazards and challenges of the job. <br>“I daresay these recruits are the best trained, most physically fit, most street-ready to ever emerge from any fire academy in the country,” said Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones. “We are very proud of that fact.” <br>Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt spoke of the community that often forms with the job. <br>“You have a whole group of other fellow firefighters that are here to support you. Some days are going to be harder than others, but you can persevere and you can make it through as long as you have the support that you need.” <br>Mayor Ed Gainey administered the Oath of Office after calling for a standing ovation and thanking families. <br>“To the families, I want to say ‘thank you.’ Thank you, because at the end of the day, I know you watched them grow as they arrived at this moment. We know the power of love and support and what it does. Thank you for your dedication to making them believe in themselves.” <br>After being granted the traditional weekend off after graduation by Chief Jones, firefighters will begin work with their platoons next week. <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17277_BEFCDB21-CDF7-4827-B7BC-C821FE1F7CAA.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17273_A403A7EA-1927-4B79-A96C-9BCE0418B3BC.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17274_08BE54A7-463D-4144-9D53-A87AF2D7C1AB.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17275_4789C0CD-A85F-4C93-B5FC-96625C5ACC9F.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17268_A1EBBCE4-CA69-469F-AEF5-77839714DC9F.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17270_F37D4C9E-572C-4A8B-86E3-B6381D0AE51F.jpeg) | 11/2/2022 13:46:24 |
| Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Holds Swearing-In and Promotions Ceremony | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 4, 2022) – Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services held a swearing-in ceremony Friday for EMTs and paramedics. The ceremony was held in Council Chambers at the City-County Building. <br>Three new EMTs and ten paramedics were sworn in during the ceremony. One paramedic received a promotion. <br>Romi Chaouk, Williams McHenry and Logan Ondos were sworn in as EMTs.      <br>Robert Catley, Willem deBoer, Ryan Kesting, Zachary Koenecke, Brandon Prevost, Samuel Rest, Andrew Schartner, Michael Schmidt, Cameron Rogers and Graham Weston were sworn in as paramedics. <br>Paramedic Edward Parker was promoted. <br>Kicking off the ceremony, EMS Chief Ronald Romano directly addressed the families. <br>“Thank you for supporting them in the work they do for the city’s citizens. Thank you for sharing them with us and understanding when they miss a family event because they are helping someone else.”<br>Medical Director for the City of Pittsburgh Dr. Ronald Roth cited the foundational and revolutionary history of emergency care in Pittsburgh by the Freedom House Ambulance Service. Established in 1967, it was the first emergency medical service to provide training beyond basic first aid. The team of mostly Black paramedics set the standard for emergency care not only for future Pittsburgh paramedics, but programs around the country. <br>“This legacy continues today,” he said. “Not satisfied with that success, Pittsburgh EMS is on the forefront of treating victims of opioid overdose. We actually start treating victims in the field. We are one of only three or four other agencies in the country to do this.” <br>Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt connected that past with the new potential in the Bureau of EMS. <br>“You are now a part of that history. I want you to think about the future, and think about what we as Pittsburgh can continue to do to create new pathways for EMS and care for the people we serve. I want you to think of new, innovative ideas that we can implement. Bring those ideas forward.” <br>After administering the oaths of office, Mayor Ed Gainey encouraged the newest members of Pittsburgh EMS to lean on each other, and commended them for their heart to serve the city.<br>“As you serve each other, you will be able to serve the public with greater respect, love, admiration,and tolerance. You will help us build a city that is welcoming.”<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17456_EMS_1.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17457_EMS_2.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17458_EMS_3.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17459_EMS_4.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17460_EMS_5.jpg) | 4/3/2022 12:48:12 |
| Pittsburgh Public Safety Prepares for St. Patrick's Day Festivities | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 10, 2022) – Following two years of subdued celebrations due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Pittsburgh Public Safety is anticipating a more robust turnout this St. Patrick’s Day. Larger-than-usual crowds are expected to gather for the full return of the annual parade. <br>In addition, the traditional post-parade gathering spots on the South Side, Downtown and North Shore are also likely to see a return to pre-pandemic crowd sizes as Covid-19 mitigation measures such as mask-usage and social distancing ease across the United States.   <br>“After two very challenging years, it’s understandable that people will be in the mood to celebrate one of Pittsburgh’s more beloved traditions; St. Patrick’s Day,” said Public Safety Director, Lee Schmidt. “We encourage everyone to have fun and enjoy the day, but to do so safely, remaining mindful that while the worst of the pandemic appears to have waned at this moment, it has not disappeared entirely.” <br>Director Schmidt reminds everyone that disruptive and illegal behavior will not be tolerated. Pittsburgh Police and its County and State law enforcement partners will be monitoring crowds for underage drinking, public intoxication, and drinking and driving. Officers from the Pittsburgh Police Mounted, Motorcycle, Bicycle and K9 units will be assisting zone officers on regular patrol.  <br>Temporary light towers will be positioned in the busiest club and restaurant districts to provide an additional level of security. A reminder that it is illegal to consume alcohol in unlicensed public spaces. Open container laws will be strictly enforced.  <br>Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire officials and the PA Liquor Control Board will conduct occupancy checks and clear and close any establishment that exceeds occupancy limits.   <br>In addition, paramedics and EMTs from the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS will be staging near celebration spots around the City. <br>Most importantly, please do not drink and drive. We urge everyone to use alternatives such as a designated driver, public transportation, taxis or ride-sharing platforms. Drivers are reminded to use proper pullover areas so as to keep lanes clear for public safety access. Those drivers who stop and block traffic will be cited. If you do plan to drive, please slow down and use extra care on the roads as an accumulation of between 3-6 inches of snow is predicted.<br>As always, Pittsburgh Public Safety encourages everyone to report any suspicious activity to 9-1-1 and to celebrate safely and responsibly. | 9/3/2022 17:34:34 |
| Pittsburgh Police Launch Community Engagement Initiative Involving Local Faith-Based Organizations | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 22, 2022) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is pleased to announce its partnership with and participation in the OneCOP (One Congregation, One Precinct) program to strengthen ties between police and the communities they serve.  <br>The national initiative coming to Pittsburgh was created by the Atlanta-based social change organization, MovementForward, Inc. OneCOP is the organization’s signature program which facilitates positive, ongoing partnerships between local law enforcement agencies and diverse congregations of every faith tradition. This includes organizing various crime and violence prevention-solving efforts, hosting public safety briefings, providing cultural and sensitivity training, conducting officer appreciation events, holding community safety workshops and hosting forums focused on improving the relationship between police and citizens.  <br>“The OneCOP initiatve is a cutting-edge enhancement to the community outreach that our law enforcement community has long engaged in. In our continuing efforts to build and expand upon existing relationships with the citizens we serve, we appeal to every faith leader who presides over a congregation to learn more and potentially join in this partnership,” said Police Chief Scott Schubert. “During a crisis is not when relationships are built. Rather, it’s when relationships grow and become established through a commitment to open conversations happening routinely before the crisis occurs, that makes all the difference.”  <br>MovementForward Inc. CEO Reverend Markel Hutchins says the OneCOP program is a holistic approach to easing tensions and building trust between the police and the community. <br>“Police reform will not happen overnight, and the long-term solution will require a substantial effort to address the grievances and negative perceptions civilians have about law enforcement. Collaborations between police agencies and local groups, especially faith-based organizations, are invaluable force-multipliers for creating safer and more engaged neighborhoods.”  <br>**For the launch of OneCOP in Pittsburgh, media members are invited to attend an inaugural luncheon on Thursday, March 24 at the IBEW Local Union 5.**<br>In advance of the luncheon, on Wednesday, March 23, Pittsburgh Police and MovementForward, Inc. will gather a select group of prominent local business, civic and faith-based community leaders to participate in mock training exercises at the Pittsburgh Police Training Academy. Attendees will experience in-person, officer-civilian reality-based scenarios, including traffic stops and an introduction to the firearms simulator. **Media is invited to attend and capture visuals of the training stations throughout the afternoon. Interviews with Pittsburgh Police and MovementForward, Inc. will be possible at the 4:15 p.m. news conference.**<br>**Details below:**<br>**Training Day**<br>Date and time: Wednesday, March 23 at 12 p.m. <br>Location: Pittsburgh Police Training Academy <br>900 N.

| Statement from Police Chief Scott Schubert Following Increased Violence in Pittsburgh | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 1, 2022) – I have been profoundly troubled by the recent spate of violent crimes in the City. In a matter of five days, there have been three shootings that have taken the lives of three young people, aggravated assaults, multiple shots fired, and now, two children, two young boys, have suffered critical stabbing injuries.  <br>While the number of violent crimes has been rising around the United States since 2020 and the onset of the pandemic, this is an oversimplified explanation. This is unacceptable in Pittsburgh. This is not reflective of the city we know and love. People are clearly hurting. <br>As the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, we strive daily to work with all of our communities to build a safer, more equitable city for everyone. Our officers will investigate all crimes, but we are also there to help, listen, and connect people with valuable social services before a crisis occurs. We urge citizens to utilize Pittsburgh Police as a resource. We are here to help.<br>We need to do this together. We need to look out for one another and take care of one another. Only then will we begin to heal the deep trauma that is at the root of violence. | 1/4/2022 11:27:32 |

| Chief Scott Schubert Announces Retirement from Pittsburgh Bureau of Police | (PITTSBURGH, PA),  May 27, 2022 – After 29 years with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, Chief Scott Schubert is announcing his retirement from the force.  <br>“Following deep reflection and significant discussion with my family, I have come to the decision that it is time to step away from the Chief’s position and allow one of my brothers or sisters in blue the opportunity to serve this great city and this storied institution. There has been no greater professional or personal joy than to have represented the City of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police," said Schubert. <br>Over his nearly three decades in public service, he rose through the ranks from Patrolman to Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Commander, Assistant Chief, and Acting Chief before being promoted to Chief of Police in February 2017. <br>"Being a police officer is truly the only profession I have ever wanted to pursue, but not just any police officer. From the time I was a young child I knew that I only ever wanted to be a Pittsburgh Police officer. I watched my father wear this iconic badge and patch each and every day and I knew I would follow in his footsteps. I have never regretted that decision for one moment. To serve alongside such dedicated and professional officers who continuously put their lives on the line for total strangers will always leave me awestruck. To put on this uniform every morning still fills me with such intense pride, but it's been the opportunity to work with our officers and the community to create a more equitable, safe, and inclusive City of Pittsburgh that has been my greatest passion and motivating force as Chief,” he added. <br>During his tenure, Schubert spearheaded the implementation of the pillars of former President Obama's Task Force Report on 21st Century Policing, the most important of which is to build trust and legitimacy in the community. By establishing a Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office, Community Resource and Neighborhood Resource officers created and participated in a number of community engagement-related activities in schools, churches, and neighborhoods that helped build and foster positive relationships between officers and the people they serve. Schubert created  partnerships with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pirates and Penguins to build relationships with inner-city children and youth. These partnerships have impacted hundreds of lives and continue to expand each year. <br>Chief Schubert is extremely proud of his work and relationships with Special Olympics, 412 Boxing, The Hear Foundation, and OneCOP (One Congregation, One Precinct), to name a few initiatives. <br>Back in 2016, when he was serving as Acting Chief of Police, the Bureau received a Community Policing Commendation from the U.S. Justice Department for its innovative community outreach efforts in Pittsburgh. <br>"My goal has always been to continue implementing the tenets of President Obama's Report on 21st Century Policing, building and improving on those principles year after year. One of the programs I'm most proud of, which has grown out of the National Initiative, is the creation of Group Violence Intervention (GVI). GVI is a partnership between law enforcement, social services and the faith community to mediate and interrupt violence to keep it from spreading. The Bureau has wholly embraced GVI for its emphasis on preventing crime. As the entire country has fallen victim to increased violence over the past two years, I'm confident that the PBP's GVI approach will continue to be the most successful and holistic answer to reducing violence in the long term," said Schubert.<br>Among the many accomplishments during his time as Chief of Police, Schubert led efforts to:<br>\- create a Real Time Crime Center (RTCC) to promote increased safety by utilizing crime-solving technology<br>\- fully adopt the use of Body Worn Cameras for all officers in a concerted effort to increase transparency and accountability <br>- establish the Office of Strategy, Accountability, and Resiliency (OSAR) responsible for incubating, fostering, and implementing Pittsburgh Police initiatives; advancing the strategic mission of the Chief of Police by supporting short-, mid- and long-term goals, while continuously auditing established protocols and procedures to promote economy, efficiency, diversity, accountability and accreditation in the face of external challenges, and adhering to best practices in policy and procedural review and development. <br>\- partner with the US Attorney’s Office -  Western PA District, to establish a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) unit within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. This multijurisdictional unit allowed the PBP to redeploy its focus from street impact, to strategic investigations that identify and disrupt drug trafficking and gun violence at the highest levels.  <br>\- establish a Civil Affairs Unit to ensure well-trained, experienced and compassionalt police officers serving as liaisons with activists and other stakeholders before, during and after first amendment-protected activities to increase communication, situational awareness and community trust.<br>\- make all Pittsburgh Police policies and procedures readily available on the City of Pittsburgh website <br>\- publish an extensive Annual Report with detailed crime statistics, arrest information and a demographic breakdown of the Bureau of Police to create one of the most comprehensive annual police reports of its kind in Western Pennsylvania <br>\- strengthen ties and increase information-sharing/cooperation with both federal and local law enforcement partners. <br>- enter into an agreement with the Allegheny County Police Department to ensure an independent law enforcement agency investigate all Pittsburgh Police officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths.<br>He is also a long-standing member of the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the national ATF Crime Gun Intelligence Governance Board.<br>Schubert's final day as Police Chief is Friday, July 1, 2022.<br>Deputy Chief Tom Stangrecki will serve as Acting Chief until a new Chief is named.<br>Schubert is looking forward to new opportunities to merge his public safety skills with his passion for working with the community.<br>The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the City of Pittsburgh thank him for his tireless and dedicated service to keeping residents safe, creating numerous community partnerships, and documenting the beauty of his beloved city of Pittsburgh through his photography along the way. <br>Good luck Scott!<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/18323_IMG_6781.jpg) | 27/5/2022 09:18:56 |

Thankfully no one was killed and we are keeping all of the victims in our thoughts as they recover. <br>"I'm both saddened and angry that we as a Bureau were reminded last night of the inherent risks of the profession as officers work to take violent individuals off the streets. We are grateful that our officer is out of the hospital and doing well following this traumatic experience. There is no question that his ballistic vest saved his life. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and its peer support team will ensure that he and his family receive all of the assistance they require. These incidents underscore the urgency we all feel to continue addressing the underlying causes of this increased violence. In the meantime, our officers will not waver in their commitment to keep Pittsburgh's communities safe and peaceful, answering 9-1-1 calls without hesitation," said Police Chief Scott Schubert. | 25/6/2022 23:16:19 |

Transit riders should consult schedules, as some bus and rail routes do not operate, or service ends early, on holidays. Schedules can be found here: [https://www.portauthority.org/all-schedules/](https://www.portauthority.org/all-schedules/)<br>The Public Safety Director would also like to remind people of the dangers that consumer grade fireworks pose.<br>“We all know Pittsburghers love their fireworks and while sales of consumer fireworks are legal, they remain a fire hazard and a safety concern. It is important to remember that fireworks are prohibited in Point State Park or any City park. In addition, the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, is prohibited within 150 feet of any occupied structure,” said Schmidt.<br>The City’s Fireworks Task Force enforcement initiative that began on June 27 will be in place each night until July 6 to respond to fireworks-related calls and complaints. The Fireworks Task Force is comprised of members from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.<br>And please do not forget about the welfare of your pets over the holiday weekend. Some pets can be extremely sensitive to the loud noises and flashing lights caused by fireworks, prompting them to run away or hide. Finally, temperatures are expected to reach highs in the 90s, with little to no precipitation in the forecast. With that in mind, it is important to remain hydrated with the right liquids and seek shelter from the heat and humidity throughout the day if you plan to spend several hours outside. <br>Pittsburgh Public Safety is always here if you need us and we wish you a happy and safe Independence Day weekend! | 30/6/2022 16:23:30 |

| Pittsburgh Police Sergeant Carla Kearns Graduates as Member of FBI National Academy | PITTSBURGH, PA (December 14, 2022) - On Thursday, December 8, 2022, Pittsburgh Police Sergeant Carla Kearns graduated as a member of the 284th session of the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Nationally, fewer than one percent of officers have the opportunity to attend the prestigious program. <br>Internationally known for its academic excellence, the National Academy offers ten weeks of advanced communication, leadership, and fitness training.  On average, officers who attend the program have 21 years of law enforcement experience and must have proven records as professionals within their agencies. <br>In addition to her duties as a Pittsburgh Police zone supervisor, Sergeant Kearns manages the Pittsburgh Members Assistance Program (PMAP), the Bureau's peer-to-peer support program for police. During the graduation ceremony, FBI Director Christopher Wray praised Kearns for creating the program following the tragic death of FBI Special Agent Sam Hicks. Hicks was shot and killed during the takedown of a violent drug trafficking organization while Kearns was working with him as part of an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force near Pittsburgh in 2008.  <br>“That event stuck with Carla and as she went through the grieving process, Carla realized there weren’t enough resources in place for officers struggling to process trauma from their jobs so Carla took the initiative to build a peer support program to help other officers who went through similar experiences to make sure they had the support and tools they needed to be well,” said Director Wray. <br>The 284th session of the FBI National Academy consisted of 237 law enforcement officers from 49 states and the District of Columbia, as well as from 25 countries, five military organizations, and five federal civilian organizations.  <br>A total of 53,908 graduates have completed the FBI National Academy since it began in 1935. The FBI National Academy is held in the same facility where the FBI trains its new special agents and intelligence analysts. <br>Congratulations Sergeant Kearns! <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/19944_IMG_7747.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/19945_IMG_7746.jpg) | 29/10/2022 10:30:49 |

| Statement from Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt and Acting Police Chief Thomas Stangrecki on the Death of Tyre Nichols | Our hearts are with the family and community of Tyre Nichols as they grieve their son, friend, brother and father; lost to senseless violence at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve. <br>What happened on January 7 was a violent, inexcusable failure by the officers involved.<br>The swift action of Tennessee law enforcement to investigate and charge those officers makes a strong statement, and sets an important precedent for the future of police accountability. <br>Additionally, we would like to thank all those who have gathered, and continue to gather, for exercising their right to protest peacefully. <br>Following the release of Friday's video, many have inquired whether Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has a unit similar to the Memphis "SCORPION Unit" that was involved in the death of Tyre Nichols and has since been deactivated. <br>The PBP does not have a street unit like SCORPION, which operated in a capacity to target "hotspot" areas. Such a unit will not have a place in the policies or philosophy of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.    <br>We continue our commitment to ensure fair, community-based policing, based in transparency and dignity for those we serve. | 15/12/2022 15:45:58 |

And we are always up to the challenge.” <br>Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt spoke directly to promotees about the responsibility that comes with leadership.<br>“This promotion is much more than pay raises.

| Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Holds Swearing-In Ceremony | PITTSBURGH, PA (March 10 , 2023) – Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services held a swearing-in ceremony Friday for two paramedics.The ceremony was held in the Mayor’s Conference Room. <br>The two paramedics recently completed their 180-day probationary period and will now begin their advancement through the ranks of EMS. <br>Alex Cappellini and Adam Croci were both sworn-in as paramedics. <br>EMS Chief Ronald Romano reminded the two promotees that they are part of an important tradition in the city.<br>"This is the 48th year of working in Pittsburgh, not far off from 50 years. You are now the continuation of that 48 years. It's up to you to keep us moving forward and keep us on the cutting edge of what we do everyday, and I know you're up for the task."<br>Associate Medical Director Dr. Lennie Weiss spoke about emerging from the most challenging time in the history of  prehospital care, as challenges seem amplified in the wake of the pandemic. <br>“Now more than ever, we need you. You provide access to emergency care to those who struggle. You support people with mental health needs; you care for victims of illness and injury during the scariest minutes of their lives.You are the patient advocate. As an EMS professional, you are a vital asset to our nation and our city."<br>Director Schmidt reminded the new paramedics that Pittsburgh EMS grew out of the creation of Freedom House in 1967, where first responders developed new and innovative protocols for prehospital care.<br>“Remember, as you are now part of this team, that you are also part of building new futures for EMS; not just here in Pittsburgh, because what we do in Pittsburgh <br>spreads around the world." <br>Before administering the oath of office, Mayor Ed Gainey recognized the paramedics' families and reminded them of the important role they would play as they serve the city.<br>"There are going to be things they see on the job that when they come home, they're going to need ten minutes just to decompress. They're going to need that love and support." <br>Mayor Gainey gave the two a chance to talk about why EMS is important to them.<br>The paramedics spoke of their desire to help people in the community who may not have the means or access to mainstream healthcare, their love of the city, and the work of EMS as a calling. <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20650_B31E42B9-5AC2-425F-BE54-A0E4ABEC4DAF.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20651_94BF9A88-E062-4836-8031-6B7BFB45AC17.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20652_639BA34C-ED2F-4185-A98D-9375C1A0D34B.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20653_580DE682-8AD9-427C-96D1-B49FEEEFB1F5.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20655_C7DCFEA2-4B2C-48AE-8A74-4CE8B0F5D0F9.jpeg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20654_F94A623E-335B-4641-8398-9019B1638CA8.jpeg) | 10/3/2023 14:59:30 |
| Pittsburgh EMS and the Office of Community Health & Safety Launch Community Paramedicine Program | PITTSBURGH, PA (March, 14, 2023) -- Pittsburgh EMS and the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) are proud to announce the implementation of a Community Paramedicine Program in Pittsburgh. As the birthplace of both modern paramedicine and the field of community paramedicine, this is the evolution and advancement of a long-standing tradition of public health-driven care in the city.<br>Under the direction of EMS Community Paramedic Crew Chief John Mooney and OCH&S Manager Laura Drogowski, the program will be designed to address the needs of the most vulnerable in our community. An alarming number of people in Pittsburgh are living with untreated conditions - and dying - because they do not have access to resources to manage their chronic health needs. Even when services and support systems are available, they are unable to reach them and calling 9-1-1 can become their only lifeline.<br>"The City, through Community Paramedicine, has a unique opportunity to truly "see" these residents. Ongoing support by EMS Community Paramedics and OCH&S social workers will help connect patients with the proper health services, allowing them to remain stable in their own homes and avoid future hospitalization. This reduces their reliance on the 9-1-1 system and improves patient outcomes," said EMS Assistant Chief, Mark Pinchalk. <br>Prior to the program's official launch, Crew Chief Mooney and EMS personnel have been working closely with OCH&S social workers since late 2021 to provide care to patients outside of 9-1-1 calls. <br>"Paramedics and EMTs most often see these patients on an emergency call basis, unable to help them long-term with their treatable conditions. It's devastating for first responders to regularly witness patients decline in health over multiple visits. With this dedicated, full-time program, we will be able to provide ongoing support for patients, in collaboration with other Department of Public Safety bureaus, community partners, and health systems," said Community Paramedic John Mooney.<br>Many of the patients who frequently call EMS are living with difficult-to-manage chronic health conditions such as obstructive lung diseases (asthma and COPD), diabetes, seizure disorders, and heart disease. Patients with higher rates of EMS calls also use the emergency system for minor falls, mobility challenges, and mental health issues. If their needs go unaddressed, they can experience increasingly serious or catastrophic outcomes without the ability to access resources outside of calling 9-1-1.<br>Recognizing that EMS is public health, Office of Community Health & Safety Manager Laura Drogowski helped spearhead and design the Community Paramedicine program. OCH&S community social workers, in partnership with EMS personnel, provide a continuum of care, so that residents may receive sustained, durable, health support.<br>"A devastating number of our residents are in desperate need of assistance, be that medical, social, psychological or systems navigation. The ability to access promised resources can often take hours on the phone, knowing exactly who to call and what to say; even then people fall through the cracks. Falling through the cracks means that people die, alone, from treatable conditions. Our first responders see them every day. We are committed to changing these outcomes, providing advocacy, connecting patients with resources, and fighting for what is needed," said Drogowski.<br>Moving forward, the Community Paramedic Crew Chief will work with three EMS-OCH&S liaisons and OCH&S social workers, with intensive engagement from EMS colleagues and other Department of Public Safety bureaus to provide patient care, build program infrastructure and referral partners, and train personnel to advance and grow the program.<br>Other public health-informed care programs between OCH&S and Public Safety bureaus are already operational, including collaborations with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and its People In Need of Support (PINS) program, and with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police through the Trauma Survivor Assistance Program (TSAP) and co-response unit - an ongoing pilot program operating in the North Side since February 15, 2023. <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20656_F21EDBED-6387-4354-A69D-68BBDAB53274.jpeg)<br>**EMS Community Paramedic Crew Chief John Mooney and City of Pittsburgh Community Social Worker Anmol Baxi** | 13/3/2023 10:22:04 |
| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Holds Promotions Ceremony for New Sergeants and Lieutenant | PITTSBURGH, PA, (March 30, 2023) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police held a promotions ceremony today in Council Chambers as four members advanced to the next stage in their law enforcement careers.<br>Sergeant Andrew Baker was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant, while Detective Anthony Barber, Detective Gino Macioce, and Officer Sean Gavin advanced to the rank of Sergeant.<br>Acting Chief of Police Thomas Stangrecki acknowledged that the success of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police depends on the strength of its leadership team, of which the newly promoted officers are a part. <br>“These individuals have proven their knowledge, skills and ability to be great leaders, as evidenced through their hard work and extra duties that they have taken to achieve this promotion,” said Stangrecki.<br>Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt addressed the promotees, reminding them they have been leaders throughout their careers, which isn't always an easy road. <br>"It means putting respect before popularity, which takes empathy. It means you have to care about your people more than your own discomfort - your own fear, your apprehension, and your awkwardness. You have to have the difficult conversations, you cannot be everyone's friend. True friends won't expect you to treat them differently."<br>Before Mayor Ed Gainey administered the Oath of Office, he acknowledged the importance of police officers having a support system in place.<br>“I just want to say thank you to the families that are here today. Thank you, because without love, none of them would get to this level. Without love it’s hard to grow up and advance in your career. So today, even though they are being promoted, this is also your promotion.”<br>The promotees will complete two weeks of supervisor training at the Academy, followed by three to six weeks of field training before being assigned to their new duty locations.<br>Congratulations to Lieutenant Baker and Sergeants Barber, Macioce, and Gavin! <br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20891_IMG_0688.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20892_IMG_0709.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20893_IMG_0746.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20894_IMG_0711.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20895_IMG_0731.jpg)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20896_IMG_0724.jpg) | 30/3/2023 11:37:28 |
| Department of Public Safety Marks Retirement of Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Chief, Ronald Romano | PITTSBURGH, PA (April 3, 2023) - After 45 years of devoted service to the City of Pittsburgh, EMS Chief Ronald Romano is retiring from the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS.<br>Friday, March 31, 2023 was his last day in uniform.<br>Romano began his EMS career in 1975 with Perman Ambulance Service in Pittsburgh. In March of 1978, he was hired as a paramedic with the City of Pittsburgh. He first worked on the city's North Side at Medic 4, where he spent two years. He was promoted to Crew Chief and spent five years at Medic 3 in the West End and a little more than two years at Medic 13, which has since been taken out of service. <br>He rose through the ranks over the years to first become a Field Supervisor, which later became the District Chief position. In February 2005, he advanced to Division Chief of the Ambulance Division, a position that also handled all EMS planning for major events in Pittsburgh.<br>Romano became Deputy EMS Chief in March 2016 and was promoted in October 2018 as the City's 7th Chief of Pittsburgh EMS by then-Mayor, Bill Peduto. <br>City Council honored his more than four decades of service with a proclamation, declaring March 28, 2023, Chief Ronald Romano Day in the City of Pittsburgh. <br>During the ceremony, Chief Romano thanked his wife Lucy, his daughters Rachel and Leah, his son, Ron Jr. and his extended family for their support over the years. He reflected on the many pivotal moments he experienced during his career, but acknowledged that his most fulfilling accomplishment occurred relatively recently, following one of the most challenging periods during his tenure; the global COVID-19 pandemic. <br>"We did not have one employee get admitted to the hospital, let alone pass away during the pandemic. We were able to continue to support the system and put the trucks on the road every day when numerous systems across the country were shutting down.

This left her unable to continue her service to our great Pittsburgh communities. Dawn served honorably, respectfully, and with great empathy toward those in need.<br>Her policing career began in 2007, after she decided to leave the teaching field. After completing the police academy at age 37, Dawn’s first assignment was at the Zone 2 police station. Here she worked as a uniformed patrol officer before being selected for a plainclothes detective position. Detective Mercurio then transferred to the Zone 6 police station where she continued to work as a plainclothes detective before earning a promotion to sergeant early in 2018. She remained assigned to Zone 6 before her illness forced her into early retirement at the end of 2021.<br>In addition to her supervisor duties, Sergeant Mercurio was an adjunct instructor at the Pittsburgh Police Training Academy. Sergeant Mercurio also worked closely with Pittsburgh SWAT as a negotiator. This gave her the opportunity to work alongside her husband, Sergeant Larry Mercurio, who is a long time member of Pittsburgh SWAT. His additional duties include supervising the Calvin Hall Public Safety Center located in the Northview Heights section of Zone 1.<br>Dawn and Larry both grew up in Sheraden, located in the West End of Pittsburgh. Their fairytale relationship began at age 12 for Dawn and age 13 for Larry. They have never left each other’s side since.<br>The couple married on Sept 19th, 1995, although Larry argues their true anniversary date is February 14th, 1983. This was the day they made their relationship official at the Langley H.S. Valentine’s Day dance. Larry asked Dawn if she would “go with him,” and off they went forever together, as one.<br>Dawn and Larry raised three amazing children together. Dawn loved them with everything in her. She was deeply faithful and the Lord gave Dawn the most beautiful gift imaginable when both of their daughters, Taylor and Alexis, gave birth to Dawn and Larry’s two grandsons within two days of each other. Colton and Ryder were born January 22 and January 24, 2023.<br>Sergeant Mercurio spent her last months of life with a smile ear to ear, playing with her grandbabies and spending precious time with her loving husband and children. While Dawn will be incredibly missed, we know for a fact she is in heaven worshiping Jesus face to face."<br>\- The Mercurio Family<br>“He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain.

| Public Safety Statement Following Active Shooter/Critical Incident in City's Garfield Neighborhood | PITTSBURGH, PA – (August 23, 2023) – On Wednesday, August 23, 2023, Pittsburgh Police and Pittsburgh SWAT responded to the city’s Garfield neighborhood following calls for shots fired as Allegheny County Sheriff’s deputies served an eviction notice to the resident of a home in the 4800 block of Broad Street. <br>Multiple units from every police zone, as well as Public Safety personnel from Pittsburgh EMS, Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, and the Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, responded to assist, in addition to our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners.  <br>Following the nearly six-and-a-half-hour standoff, the subject was ultimately pronounced deceased at the scene by Pittsburgh EMS, shortly after 5 p.m. There were no serious injuries to any Pittsburgh Public Safety - or its partner agency - personnel.  <br>“I am immensely proud of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers from every single unit who responded to the scene immediately to support Allegheny County Sheriffs as they found themselves under fire," said Pittsburgh Police Chief, Larry Scirotto. <br>"Our officers worked seamlessly and communicated expertly, not only with each other, but also with their local, state, and federal law enforcement partners, under extremely dangerous circumstances. It's clear that our officers relied on their extensive training to prepare them for such incidents. While we had hoped that this incident would not reach this unfortunate conclusion, I am grateful none of our officers was injured in the process of trying to negotiate a peaceful surrender,” added Scirotto.<br>In the coming days and weeks, City of Pittsburgh social workers and trauma support teams from the Office of Community Health & Safety will be making themselves available in Garfield and throughout the city to ensure community members have access to the support services they might require following this traumatic event.  <br>“Our Public Safety personnel - a family -,  the community of Garfield, and indeed the entire City of Pittsburgh, suffered a collective trauma today in experiencing this unfortunate incident. I want to commend all of the Department of Public Safety officials who worked tirelessly throughout the day in an effort to bring this to an end. I will ensure that our Public Safety employees, in addition to community members, are afforded all of the services they need to help process what they have witnessed today,” said Public Safety Director, Lee Schmidt. <br>Pittsburgh Public Safety would also like to thank all of its local, state, and federal law enforcement partners who assisted in this effort, including:  <br>The Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office, the Allegheny County Police Department, Pennsylvania State Police, the FBI, the ATF, North Hills SRT, SHACOG SWAT, HSI, Port Authority Police, the Allegheny County Crime Lab, the Attorney General's Office, and the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office.  <br>Pennsylvania State Police will be investigative agency for this incident. | 23/8/2023 22:20:39 |

| Pittsburgh Police Launch New Crime Data Portal | PITTSBURGH, PA (October 4, 2023) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is pleased to announce a new publicly-available dashboard, created by the Crime Analysis Unit, which provides a general overview of criminal activity that occurs across the city. <br>Information for the **Police Data Portal** is collected from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) records management system which stores all records of **reported** criminal activity.  <br>The timeframe for the data is year-to-date for 2023 and will be manually updated on a monthly basis between the first and fifth to reflect the preceding month. As the Bureau transitions to the new Records Management System (RMS), it aims to establish as close to a real-time data feed as possible, which would allow for more frequent or automatic updates to the information. <br>“By making comprehensive crime data publicly available and easily accessible, residents are better informed about their own neighborhoods, the city as a whole, and the work of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. As Chief, I am committed to driving accountability through transparency and the Police Data Portal is another building block toward that goal,” said Pittsburgh Police Chief, Larry Scirotto.  <br>The data portal allows users to filter the information by police zone, neighborhood, crime type, and date. All of the information is provided at the incident level. Violent crimes of a sexual nature have been excluded from the data set that populates the dashboard. In addition, no personally identifying information is attached to the incidents and all locations have been masked to the block-level, meaning that no specific addresses are made public. <br>It should be noted that the data included in this portal is gathered from police reports. A police report is a formal document detailing circumstances of a criminal incident that has been brought to the attention of law enforcement. Police reports are not the same as "call for service" records. While reports may be filed as a result of a call for service, not all calls result in a police report.  <br>Check out the Police Data Portal on the City of Pittsburgh website: https://pittsburghpa.gov/police/data-portal<br>Scroll down the page to the Interactive Activity Map section and click on the "Police Data Portal" link for the dashboard.<br>Below is an image for reference.<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/22666_Image_Portal.jpg) | 2/10/2023 12:13:21 |

Additionally, he is a team physician for the Pittsburgh Steelers football club<br>“Citizens and healthcare professionals alike are fortunate to reside in Pittsburgh, the founding place of EMS in our country, because of outstanding local programs like Freedom House and the Center for Emergency Medicine. Dr. Roth has expanded that heritage during a tenure of over 30 dedicated years and carved a future to continue partnerships with the strongest emergency medical service and public safety program in the nation. I am proud to continue his legacy,” said Dr. Lenny Weiss, incoming City of Pittsburgh Medical Director.<br>The entire Department of Public Safety thanks Dr. Roth for his selfless service to the city and wishes him a happy and well-deserved retirement.<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/22787_Roth_Image.jpeg) | 10/10/2023 16:15:35 |

| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Makes Transition from Uniform Crime Reporting Method to National Incident Based Reporting System | PITTSBURGH, PA, (November 14, 2023) -- Beginning today, in accordance with the national shift in crime data collection and reporting methods, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will switch over to the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). <br>NIBRS is the law enforcement community's standard for quantifying crime, replacing the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) method which was formally discontinued on January 1, 2021. <br>With this changeover, the public should be aware that there are important differences between the two reporting methods that result in crime statistics that initially appear to be higher than usual, due to the specificity of the information gathered using the NIBRS system. <br>Here are some of the key differences between the two reporting methods:<br>**Changes in offenses** \- Both NIBRS and UCR collect data on "crimes against persons" and "crimes against property" for such offenses as homicide, aggravated assault, rape, robbery, burglary, arson, auto theft, and others.<br>But unlike UCR, NIBRS also documents the additional category of "crimes against society" which do not actually involve an injured party or piece of property. These would include prohibitions against certain types of activity such as drugs, gambling, pornography, prostitution, and weapons law violations.<br>NIBRS also documents offenses such as animal cruelty, extortion, and identity theft.<br>**Seriousness of offenses -** NIBRS tends to show higher figures than UCR due to the manner in which offenses are counted.<br>UCR data recognizes the most serious offense committed during an incident, whereas NIBRS essentially eliminates the "hierarchy" of offenses, as officers can collect data on up to 10 criminal offenses within an incident. <br>For example, using the old UCR system, in a reported incident where a homicide occurs, but the actor also breaks into the home, vandalizes it, and then steals a vehicle to leave the crime scene, only the most serious offense of homicide would be reported. Using NIBRS, every offense would be included in one report, provided the offenses are separate and distinct crimes and each are mutually exclusive crimes. <br>**Changes in crime classification -** Under the old UCR system, offenses are categorized as Part I - serious crimes against persons and property -  and Part II - all other non-miscellaneous offenses. These will be replaced by Group A and Group B offenses under NIBRS. Group A is comprised of more than 20 indexed crime categories, as opposed to the eight indexed offenses in the UCR. Officers will have to determine which category an offense belongs to in order to determine whether an arrest report or an incident report will be required.<br>Under UCR, attempted crimes are reported as crime. The new NIBRS system focuses on whether the crime was attempted or completed. <br>NIBRS does not allow duplicate offenses based on incident-based reporting (IBR) codes. For example, possession of cocaine _and_ possession of heroin would qualify as one drug offense, not two. As mentioned previously, officers may report multiple offenses, provided they are separate and distinct crimes, each mutually exclusive.<br>Pittsburgh Police Acting Commander of Administration, Patrick Fosnaught, headed up the team that has been working since 2021 to build out the new records management and reporting system.<br>"With a great deal of assistance from our partners in Allegheny County, as well as help from other police agencies that are currently using the system, the team has worked to meet the more specific needs of the Pittsburgh Police through data input, design, and focused outputs. The new system will provide better data collection, upgraded functionality, improved performance, and enhanced search and investigative capabilities.

| Pittsburgh Police Mark the Passing of Therese Rocco, Pittsburgh's First Female Assistant Chief | PITTSBURGH, PA, (December 12, 2023) -- It is with deep sadness that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police acknowledges the death of Therese Rocco at age 97. <br>Rocco began at age 19 as a clerk in the Bureau's then all-female Missing Persons Unit, before becoming an officer in 1952.<br>Also known as "The Rock," her storied law enforcement career spanned more than 40 years. <br>She rose through the ranks to become a Captain, then a Commander in 1986, before being promoted in 1989 to Assistant Chief of Police, the first woman in the department, and the country, to reach such a high-ranking position. She also became a nationally renowned expert in the field of missing persons, particularly children.<br>Rocco grew up in the Hill District and later lived in Brookline, retiring in 1994.<br>"With her courage and tenaciousness, Therese Rocco blazed a trail not only for women, but for all those who may have once believed a career in law enforcement was out of reach for them.

She also acknowledged the case of Mary Ann Verdecchia, a 10-year-old girl who disappeared in 1962 from Bloomfield and was never found. Rocco was the lead investigator and said the unsolved case still troubled her. <br>The Bureau's thoughts are with Therese Rocco's family, friends, and former colleagues during this difficult time. <br>On Monday, December 18, Frank F. DeBor Funeral Home located at 1065 Brookline Blvd. will hold a viewing and prayer service from 09:30-10:30 a.m. Pittsburgh Police will provide ceremonial honors during this time.    <br>A funeral mass will follow at St.Teresa of Kolkata Parish, St. Pius X Church located at 3040 Pioneer Avenue. Mass will begin at 11:00 a.m.<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/23511_IMG-4220.jpg)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/23512_20230614_190915252_iOS.jpg) | 12/12/2023 06:33:07 |

City of Pittsburgh tax money funds the program to ensure that the population of dogs and cats in Pittsburgh remains at sustainable levels.<br>However, during a recent evaluation of the program, it became clear that services were being used in inappropriate ways disingenuous to the spirit of the program.

| Pittsburgh Public Safety Prepares for Busy St. Patrick's Day Weekend | PITTSBURGH, PA -- It's that time of year again when Pittsburgh puts its black and gold pride aside to don shades of green and celebrate the city's Irish heritage on St. Patrick's Day.<br>This year, March 17 falls on a Sunday, while the St. Patrick's Day parade will be held on Saturday, March 16, making for a full weekend of celebrations in the city. <br>"Department of Public Safety employees from all of the bureaus have been preparing for months to ensure residents and visitors can safely enjoy the parade and entertainment areas of the city this weekend. Working closely with the Pittsburgh Police Intelligence Unit, I am confident that the city is hosting a world-class parade in which everyone should feel comfortable participating," said Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt.<br>For more than 150 years, the annual St. Patrick's Day parade has attracted huge crowds. This year, as many as 200,000 spectators are expected to line the route. The parade kicks off at 10 a.m. on Liberty Avenue and 11th Street at the edge of the Strip District, with staging beginning at 26th and Liberty at approximately 7 a.m. **(See map below)**.<br>The route proceeds down Grant Street from Liberty and turns right onto the Boulevard of the Allies before ending at the reviewing stand at Stanwix Street. "No Parking" signs have been placed along the 1.4 mile long parade route 48 hours in advance of the event, which is estimated to last about three-and-a-half hours. Tagging and towing will begin at 6 a.m. Saturday morning.<br>Pittsburgh Police are fully staffed for the parade and festivities downtown, the South Side, and on the North Shore with law enforcement support from the Allegheny County Police, Pennsylvania State Police, and Port Authority Police. Pittsburgh EMS, Fire, Emergency Management and Homeland Security, and dozens of Public Safety Crossing guard personnel will also be supporting both the parade and entertainment areas throughout the city.<br>The South Side, with its unique entertainment district along E. Carson Street, has traditionally been the focal point for St. Patrick's Day revelers. <br>"The South Side is known for its hospitality. The residents, business owners, and City of Pittsburgh staff are excited to welcome guests from all over the region to our great neighborhood. Public Safety has assembled an extensive team to keep everyone safe and Public Works will be on hand to keep the neighborhood clean. I look forward to seeing your Irish pride on Saturday," said District 3 Councilperson, Bob Charland. <br>Starting this weekend and moving forward, Pittsburgh Police will also have a new substation on Mary Street which will be open from **7 p.m. to 5 a.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.** This will give officers the ability to attend roll call, complete paperwork, or take breaks when needed, while remaining close to the action on E. Carson, rather than having to return to the main station in Allentown. The building will not be open to the public and it will not be used as a place to hold or detain arrestees.<br>The Department of Public Safety strongly encourages everyone who is celebrating this weekend to find a safe ride home either from a designated driver, via rideshare platforms, or public transit. This year, there are some convenient new ways to help make that easier. Rideshare drivers will have two assigned pick-up and drop-off lanes in the South Side. One will be located at S.18th St. from E. Carson to Wrights Way. The other will be at 20-26 Bedford Square off of S.12th Street. These designated lanes will help mitigate foot and vehicle traffic gridlock on Carson Street when the bars close.<br>If you must drive into the city, please consider parking - free of charge - in the Second Avenue Parking Plaza. The large surface lot is a short walk to downtown restaurants and bars, as well as to the South Side via the 10th Street Bridge. **(See map below)**.<br>The weather is expected to be seasonal over the weekend with temperatures in the 40s and 50s and a chance of showers on Sunday, so please dress accordingly. <br>"The Department of Public Safety wishes everyone the luck of the Irish this weekend and I ask that you assist our first responders by celebrating responsibly and doing your part to keep our beautiful city safe this St. Patrick's Day," said Director Schmidt.<br>For more tips on how to celebrate responsibly please visit the Office of Nighttime Economy Facebook page: [https://www.facebook.com/PGHnightEcon](https://www.facebook.com/PGHnightEcon)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/24431_image.png)<br>![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/24430_st_pats_parking_map.JPG) | 14/3/2024 21:10:12 |
| City of Pittsburgh Office of Community Health and Safety Celebrates Launch of the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) Program | _LEAD is an effective, replicable, and equitable diversion method that seeks to address the root causes of criminal justice involvement._<br>**PITTSBURGH —** The Department of Public Safety’s Office of Community Health and Safety (OCHS) and Mayor Ed Gainey today celebrated the official launch of the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program in the City of Pittsburgh. <br>The LEAD initiative is a community-based diversion approach with the goals of improving public safety and public order, and reducing unnecessary justice system involvement of people who participate in the program. It will provide individuals with substance use disorder and mental and behavioral health challenges with intense case management and person-centered social services focused on harm reduction in lieu of criminalization. <br>“When we unveiled the Pittsburgh Plan for Peace, we talked about the need to create high quality, diversionary programs and opportunities for those at risk for falling into a life of violence," said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Signing onto this MOU will help us provide these types of programs, and is a promise kept to the residents of Pittsburgh.”  <br>The city has been exploring a diversion program since 2019. In other cities, similar programs have been shown to pay for themselves in the long run by decreasing court costs and crime. Thanks to the collaboration amongst various stakeholders, the City of Pittsburgh’s program has been awarded funding to cover start-up costs and most programmatic expenses for the first three years. <br>“A law enforcement assisted diversion program has been a work in progress for a number of years in the City of Pittsburgh,” said Lee Schmidt, Director of Public Safety. “We are excited to launch this prevention-focused program that connects critical communities to resources and social services and ultimately allows our first responders to focus on emergent needs.” <br>The program will launch in Spring 2024 in Police Zones 1 and 2 and will center on individuals repeatedly arrested for low-level offenses associated with unmet behavioral health needs, trauma, and/or extreme poverty. Examples of such offenses include Retail Theft, Simple Possession, Possession of Paraphernalia, Prostitution, Public Intoxication, Simple Trespass, Defiant Trespass, Criminal Trespass, and Disorderly Conduct. <br>“The LEAD program has demonstrated a reduction in recidivism, homelessness, overdoses, and the high utilization of 911 services,” said Chief of Police Larry Scirotto. “The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is proud to partner on such an initiative and looks forward to even better relationships between law enforcement personnel and the community.”  <br>LEAD is made possible through the committed coordination and support of numerous stakeholders, including the Allegheny County Health Department, Department of Human Services, CONNECT, District Attorney’s office, Public Defender’s office, Allegheny County Courts, Allegheny County Probation and Parole, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, and the national LEAD Support Bureau. <br>Additional information on the City of Pittsburgh’s Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program can be found [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/24603_OCHS_What_is_LEAD.pdf). <br>### | 11/4/2024 13:57:53 |
| Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Updates Response Protocol for Burglar Alarms | PITTSBURGH, PA -- In an effort to serve city residents and businesses in the most efficient and effective manner possible, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is making adjustments to the manner in which officers are dispatched to burglar alarm system activations in the city. <br>Under the current model, Pittsburgh Police respond to all burglar alarms as priority calls, even if the alarm company is unable to reach the homeowner, business owner, or key holder to verify the alarm. This results in thousands of police staff hours each year for officers dispatched to alarms; the overwhelming majority of which are false. In response to this, the Bureau's Crime Analysis Unit was asked to compile data on the number of calls for service in 2023 for burglar alarms, and the police reports generated from those calls.<br>The audit found the following:<br>- There were 9,097 calls for service for burglar alarms in 2023<br>- Of those 9,097, 39 of those - or 0.43% - generated police reports<br>- Of the 39 incidents, 6 involved a verified (non-false) alarm, a break-in occurring, and an actor near the incident<br>- The majority of the burglar alarms with police reports - 25 out of 39 (64%) - resulted from vandalism or objects being thrown through windows; or in total 25 out of 9097 (0.27%)<br>"These 9,097 calls resulted in 4,166 police staff hours, or 174 days, with an average of 13.5 minutes per unit spent on burglar alarm responses. This is not a cost-effective or productive use of officers' time that could be spent bolstering community engagement efforts, increasing training time, expanding proactive patrols, and prioritizing officer wellness initiatives. Several cities across the U.S. have adopted this model which has resulted in cost savings for residents without sacrificing service quality or public safety," says Police of Chief, Larry Scirotto.<br>Under the new model, officers will be dispatched to the following types of alarms as a priority response:<br>- Hold-up alarms (human-activated) <br>- Panic alarms (human-activated)<br>- Medical alert alarms (secondary to Pittsburgh EMS) <br>- Priority locations such as, but not limited to, government buildings, critical infrastructure, firearms sales/storage locations, medical facilities, or any other location where a burglary or unauthorized intrusion has the potential to become a larger threat to public safety<br>- Verified burglar alarms where the homeowner, business owner, key-holder, witness, or alarm company provides reliable information to support a belief that a crime has happened or is in progress, i.e., video or audio of unauthorized individuals in or around the property, second authentication factor, or eyewitness reports on-scene to verify a break-in<br>- Multiple progressive alarm activations, i.e. activation of a window alarm, followed by activation of a motion detector alarm inside of the building <br>**Verified burglar alarms will be dispatched as high priority calls. U** **nverified burglar alarms will be dispatched with the same level of response given to other non-priority calls for service and placed in a queue.**<br>In advance of implementation, Chief Scirotto has outlined the new standard operating procedure for burglar alarm response in a bureau-wide memorandum to officers. The Allegheny County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) has also been made aware of the changes as they pertain to dispatch roles and responsibilities for residential and commercial burglar alarms. Upon receiving a burglar alarm activation, EOC dispatchers will attempt to verify the alarm and assign call priority based on whether the alarm is verified or unverified. <br>In an effort to minimize Pittsburgh Police response to false alarms, the Pittsburgh Police Telephone Reporting Unit will begin documenting officer responses to false alarms and enforcing City of Pittsburgh ordinance 611.07, which pertains to penalties for false burglar alarms. In line with the ordinance, the alarm holder will be permitted two false alarm responses. For each false burglar alarm thereafter, the permit holder will be required to pay a fee. Upon the fifth documented false alarm activation in a calendar year, Pittsburgh Police supervisors are permitted to disregard the call. <br>Last year, officers responded to nearly 1,500 repeat addresses, which generated 6,857 burglar alarms - or approximately 75% of all burglar alarm calls. One single address in the city resulted in 81 calls for service for burglar alarms in 2023, reinforcing the need to hold permit holders financially responsible for police response to multiple false alarms.<br>To register your home or business security system, please visit [HERE](https://onestoppgh.pittsburghpa.gov/pghprod/webui/#) on the City of Pittsburgh website.
