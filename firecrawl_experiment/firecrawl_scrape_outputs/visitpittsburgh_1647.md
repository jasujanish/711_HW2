# 6 Things You Didn’t Know About Pennsylvania’s Whiskey Legacy (and Where to See It Today)

When it comes to America’s whiskey origins, few states have a richer story to tell than Pennsylvania.

Long before Kentucky took the spotlight, Western Pennsylvania was crafting what would become one of the nation’s most influential spirits, Monongahela rye. From trailblazing distillers to dramatic shuttering during Prohibition, the region’s history is steeped in whiskey lore, and you can experience it all today at [**West Overton Village and Museum**](http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=7013690370&iu=/76691750/WestOvertonVillageandMuseum), less than an hour from downtown Pittsburgh!

## Let’s explore six surprising facts about Pennsylvania whiskey.

## 1\. Pennsylvania is the Birthplace of American Rye Whiskey

In the late 1700s and early 1800s, many Pennsylvania farmers—particularly German, Scottish, and Irish immigrants—began distilling surplus rye grain into whiskey as a way to supplement their income. By 1810, the state was home to approximately 3,600 distilleries, including the one at West Overton. These distilleries primarily produced rye whiskey, made from a mash bill with its rye grain content much higher than the 51% as defined by today’s standards.

**Experience it today:** In the spirit of stewardship and resourcefulness, most of what was needed to produce and sell their whiskey was created on the property at West Overton. Rye was grown in the fields, grain was processed in the gristmill, wooden barrels were built on site, and waste mash was fed to the hogs. Learn how a family farm was transformed into a thriving industrial village on a [**guided tour**](http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=7017564149&iu=/76691750/GuidedTour) of the 1838 Overholt Homestead.

## 2\. West Overton is Home to One of America’s Oldest Whiskey Brands

The story of Overholt™ Whiskey begins with Heinrich Oberholtzer, later anglicized to Henry Overholt, who established the family’s distilling tradition with a modest two-still operation at West Overton. In 1810, his son Abraham Overholt formally established the Overholt™ whiskey business. Passed down through generations, the brand grew steadily in reputation and reach. In 1987, Jim Beam acquired Overholt™ and moved its production to Kentucky, but its origins remain rooted in Pennsylvania. Today, Overholt™ holds the distinction of being the longest-standing whiskey brand in US history, continuously maintained since 1810, with West Overton as its spiritual home.

This in-depth tasting connects the past and present in the very place where it all began.

## 3\. Monongahela Rye Was Once a Global Export

By the mid-1800s, Monongahela rye, named for the Monongahela River Valley where it was first produced, had gained popularity not just across the United States but also as an export to Europe and other international markets. Its reputation was built on consistent quality and a bold, spicy flavor. Monongahela rye solidified Pennsylvania’s status as a major player in early American distilling. While today's Monongahela rye is not exported at the scale it once was, its global reputation endures among whiskey enthusiasts.

Redeem your stickers for Pour Tour collectibles along the way.

## 4\. By 1900, Pennsylvania Had 73 Whiskey Distilleries

Pennsylvania distilleries industrialized over the course of the 19th century, and by 1900, there were 73 distilleries producing 7.2 million gallons. Small, farm-based distilleries struggled to compete with larger operations in an era of industry consolidation, stricter taxes and regulations, and growing competition from other regions. The rise of the temperance movement, World War I, and finally Prohibition in 1920 spelled the end of the industry at large. While several Pennsylvania distilleries reopened after Prohibition ended in 1933, rye whiskey could not regain its pre-Prohibition prominence, and the last of the old distilleries closed in 1990.

Step into the [**Sam Komlenic Gallery**](http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=7016196388&iu=/76691750/SamKomlenicGallery), where over 270 vintage Pennsylvania whiskey bottles—many from now-defunct distilleries—along with barrels, crates, advertisements, signage, and memorabilia tell the story of an industry nearly erased.

## 5\. Pennsylvania Whiskey Created Infrastructure and Entire Towns

Distilling wasn’t just a side business; it was an economic engine. Farmers converted rye into whiskey for higher profit margins, employed local workers, supported grain suppliers, and helped build communities in the process. West Overton became a company town, home to hundreds of people and 50 buildings.

**Experience it today:** West Overton Village is the best surviving example of these historic whiskey towns. The museum tells the story of industrialization in the region through the eyes of various workers in the award-winning exhibition [**"Forging Ahead and Falling Behind: Industrial Growth in a Rural Community."**](http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=7017568718&iu=/76691750/ForgingAhead)

## 6\. Pennsylvania is Experiencing A Whiskey Revival
