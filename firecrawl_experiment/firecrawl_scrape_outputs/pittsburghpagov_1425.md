# Black History Month

Black History Month 2025 celebrates the National Negro Opera Company (NNOC), founded in 1941 in Pittsburgh as the first African American opera company in the United States. Mary Cardwell Dawson established the company with the goal of promoting African American performers in the opera world, which was predominantly white at the time. The NNOC was instrumental in breaking racial barriers within the classical music world, offering a platform for Black opera singers to showcase their talents and gain recognition for more than two decades.

## Tribute to Mary Cardwell Dawson

Mary Cardwell Dawson (1894 – 1962) was a trailblazer in the world of opera and classical music. This gifted opera singer and music educator served as the founding force behind the National Negro Opera Company. Dawson was committed to improving opportunities for African American musicians, particularly in the opera world, where Black artists faced significant discrimination.

Her vision for the NNOC was to create a space where African Americans could perform opera at the highest level and gain the same recognition and opportunities as their white counterparts.  She believed that opera was a powerful medium through which African American culture could be showcased and celebrated.
