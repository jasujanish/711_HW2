# About Finance

The Department also manages tax abatements (including homestead and senior citizen exemptions), tracks tax increment financing, and performs audits designed to help business taxpayers to submit returns correctly. The Department is also the designated tax collector for the Pittsburgh School District as well as the Carnegie Library.

In addition to collections of revenue, the Finance Department performs a number of other functions. This includes the sale of tax delinquent property through Treasurer’s Sales, sale of City-owned property, tax assessment appeals, and city-wide cash management. The Department performs tax audits and ensures that money owed to the City is collected fairly. The Department also manages City debt through bonds and borrowing as well as manages the City’s Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund, with liabilities exceeding $1.2 billion dollars.
