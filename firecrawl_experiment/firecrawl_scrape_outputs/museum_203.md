Enjoy a free guided tour of the bird banding lab and research facility including the flight tunnel. Visit the bird banding lab and see up-close how researchers safely capture and band birds, and learn about the data they gather. Learn about how we’re studying avian perception of glass to provide glass manufacturers and building designers with important information that will help reduce bird-window collisions.

This event takes place in an area typically closed to the public—don’t miss it! Guests must pre-register for the tour and arrive at Powdermill Avian Research Center by 8:00 a.m. The tour is 1.5 hours long.
