## 1\. Overview

### Learn more about City Planning's Boards, Commissions, and Panels

The Department of City Planning (DCP) facilitates a number of Boards, Commissions, Panels, and Development Activities Meetings (DAMs) which review zoning variances and elements of development, design, public art, and historic preservation.

For additional information on a Board, Commission, or Panel, such as appointed members or past meeting minutes, please choose from the above table of contents or navigate through sections at the bottom of this page.

## 2\. Contextual Design Advisory Panel (CDAP)

_CDAP meets every other Tuesday, alternating with Planning Commission_

The Contextual Design Advisory Panel (CDAP) is comprised of eight members with expertise in the physical development of the City. The panel's mission is to promote quality of life in the City of Pittsburgh. CDAP achieves its mission through professional, voluntary design assistance to maximize the economic, civic, contextual, and aesthetic value of new development projects impacting the public realm. To fulfill this mission, CDAP advises the Department of City Planning by reviewing and providing design guidance on selected, higher profile projects throughout the City.

CDAP is an advisory panel, not a commission. Together with staff design review, the panel works to resolve design issues through professional peer critique before a Commission conducts its review. This frees the the Commission to focus on its responsibility of assuring that new developments are consistent with the overall planning objectives of the City. Some examples of these core considerations are:

- _The extent to which each development proposal addresses successful design, public space enhancement, context sensitivity and sustainable urbanism._
- _Ensuring that projects feature well designed buildings and landscapes that engage both users and the streetscape. Buildings should also make appropriate connections to adjacent sites and to the larger neighborhood._
- _The use of sustainable building materials and designs which consider the longer-term impact and use of a single project._

**CDAP Members**(show below)

**Contextual Design Advisory Panel Members**

- _Eric Booth, AIA_
- _Bruce Chan_
- _Ryan Indovina, RA, LEED AP_
- _Greg LaForest, AIA, LEED AP_
- _Cassandra Osterman, AIA_
- _Peter Quintanilla_
- _Bob Reppe_
- _Claudia Saladin, ASLA, LEED AP_

**CDAP's Role in City Planning Design Review Process**(show below)

Design review is a collaborative process between City Planning and project's design team. Staff Design Review is the initial design review phase using information submitted by the applicant. City Planning staff develop a set of Urban Design Targets, which are tailored to the development proposal, the unique site conditions, and the neighborhood and context of the development. Staff work with the applicant to address the Urban Design Targets and to satisfy design-related zoning requirements.

During the initial Staff Design Review phase, City Planning staff will recommend projects for review by CDAP. CDAP review is voluntary, but highly recommended for some projects. The applicant will update the design to address the Urban Design Targets and incorporate the staff’s comments, in preparation for the CDAP meeting. At the meeting, the project representative presents and discusses the project, surrounding context, and design concepts. CDAP members ask questions and make recommendations to the project representative.

**Projects Reviewed by CDAP**(show below)

Projects that CDAP may review range from building additions to multi-parcel developments. Staff evaluates each project and its surrounding context and determines whether CDAP review would be beneficial. This determination will be made early in the review process. The criteria considered include the size of the project, complexity of the design context, and impact on the public realm. Generally, CDAP reviews:

- _Project Development Plans_
- _Final Land Development Plans_
- _Projects undergoing Site Plan Review_

**CDAP Meeting Material**(show below)

1. Revisions to any items previously submitted for Design Review
2. Site plan showing proposed project and surrounding context
3. Landscape plan showing surrounding context and proposed planting list
4. Building elevations showing surrounding context and proposed materials
5. When applicable, building sections showing site context
6. Perspective views and renderings showing project in surrounding context
7. Perspective views and renderings showing pedestrian context and sidewalk-level views
8. Items that address Staff Design Review comments and Urban Design Targets

**Meeting Format**(show below)

The most common format used for CDAP meetings follows the below outline. City Planning staff will introduce the Panel, provide a brief project introduction, and then refer to the project team for a presentation. The presentation should include a project outline and discuss context and design-related concepts and goals. The presentation should focus on design review and does not need to discuss Zoning or DOMI related reviews unless related to the overall design goals.

- _Project introduction by City Planning staff (5 minutes)_
- _Project presentation by project representative (10-15 minutes)_
- _General Panel discussion (30-40 minutes)_

After the CDAP meeting, City Planning staff sends a summary of the comments to the applicant. The applicant follows up with staff and responds to the comments by updating the design accordingly. City Planning staff will summarize the Design Review, including comments from CDAP and subsequent revisions, to convey design feedback and guidance to the Planning Commission, as the final approval determines.

In some situations, projects will be reviewed twice by CDAP. At the second meeting, the project representative presents changes since the last meeting and provides additional visuals on the project as the design has developed. The second meeting may not be necessary for projects that meet the design objectives in the first full CDAP meeting.

**Workshops**(show below)

In addition to the regularly scheduled CDAP meetings, CDAP also holds workshops. Less like a formal review, a workshop is a collaborative meeting. The project representative brings their project goals and current design to the panel members who provide design guidance. CDAP can help the project representative meet their objectives while helping to create successful urban spaces.

**Over-the-Counter Review**(show below)

Over-The-Counter (OTC) review is conducted by City Planning staff for low-impact projects that meet certain eligibility criteria. Reviews are limited to proposed projects that will have a relatively minimal impact on the public realm. Projects may be eligible for Over-The-Counter approval based on the following criteria:

1. Replacements: Projects which replace the form or content of existing elements or fixtures in order to repair, improve, or update existing implementations. Replacements may be either of the following:
   - In Kind: Repair or replacement of existing elements or fixtures with identical products, or products of a similar aesthetic that have been slightly modified due to changes in cost, product availability, or updates.

   - Content: Changes made to written content or images in order to provide updated information, branding, or imagery which maintain the same overall aesthetic.
2. Negligible Changes: Projects that will have minimal to no impact on the public realm. Negligible changes may be either of the following:
   - Low Visibility: Changes or additions that cannot be easily viewed from public property or the right-of-way.

   - Minor change: Changes or additions that will not affect the general aesthetic of the site, would go unnoticed by a large portion of visitors to the site, or would be assumed by most viewers to be a standard element of City infrastructure.
3. City Standards: Projects that fit within the City’s established design standards.

4. Modifications: Changes to the design and/or aesthetic of projects that have previously been approved by the Public Art & Civic Design Commission.


To learn more about Over-the-Counter Review, please download the PACD Commission Manual. Applications for OTC Review are submitted through the PACD Commission Application form.

## 7\. Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA)

_The ZBA meets on the first three Thursdays of each month. Meetings start at 9:00 AM._

The Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) is an adjudicative body that reviews land use proposals in accordance with the requirements of the Zoning Code. The Board reviews such matters in public evidentiary hearings at which the applicant and impacted neighbors may submit evidence or testimony in support of or in opposition to the request.
