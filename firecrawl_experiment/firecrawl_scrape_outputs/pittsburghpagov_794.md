# Fallen Officer

**A Part of America Died**(show below)

Somebody killed a policeman today,

And part of America died.

A piece of our country he swore to protect,

Will be buried with him at his side.

The suspect that shot him will stand up in court,

With counsel demanding his rights.

While a young widowed mother must work for her kids,

And spend many long lonely nights.

The beat he walked was a battle field too

just as if he had gone off to war.

Though the flag of our nation won't fly at half mast,

To his name they will add a gold star.

Yes, somebody killed a policeman today,

In your town or mine,

While we slept in comfort behind locked doors,

A cop put his life on the line.

Now his ghost walks a beat on a dark city street,

And stands at each new rookies' side.

He answered the call,of himself and gave his all,

And a part of America died.
