# Ban the Box

**Equal Opportunity for Persons Previously Convicted**

The City of Pittsburgh "Ban the Box" ordinance went into effect on August 3, 2023. The Ordinance requires that City contractors inform applicants of their rights under the law, include applicable language in their contracts, and refrain from inquiring about applicants' criminal conviction history until after they are found to be otherwise qualified. This Ordinance is administered by the City of Pittsburgh Mayor's Office.
