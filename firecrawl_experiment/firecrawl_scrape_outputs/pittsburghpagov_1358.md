# Parks FAQ

**Do I need a permit to use park facilities?**(show below)

It would be best to acquire a permit to ensure your use of the facility (field, court shelter) and to inform the maintenance personnel. Per PGH Code 475.02 Groups of 25 people or more who want to picnic are allowed only in locations for that purpose. To rent facilities see City of Pittsburgh's [online registration website](https://registerparks.pittsburghpa.gov/).

Normal operating hours are from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.; however, some facilities do close at sunset.

**Are dogs allowed in the parks?**(show below)

Yes, but the dog must be on a leash at all times, unless utilizing one of the Off-Leash Exercise Areas (OLEA'S). Dogs are not allowed in playgrounds or courts at any time. (Ordinance 473.05b)

**About Off-Leash Areas**(show below)

Citiparks offers several special areas where your dog can legally run without a leash. Off-Leash Exercise Areas (OLEAs) are important for dog socializing and unhindered play. Please enjoy these parks with your furry friends!
