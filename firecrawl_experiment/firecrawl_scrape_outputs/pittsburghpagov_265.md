**Real Estate Tax is tax collected by the City**

## Who is Taxed

All owners of real estate located within the City and School District. The market value of the property is determined by the Allegheny County Office of Property Assessment. The taxes are calculated by applying the millage rate to the assessed value.

## Discounts

Taxpayers may take a 2% discount on either of the following if taxes are paid by February 10th:

- The total annual tax due, or
- The first installment of tax due

## Tax Payment Due Dates

- Last day of February for 1st installment or the annual amount at gross
- April 30th for 2nd installment
- July 31st for 3rd installment

If no payment is made by the last day of February, or if less than the entire first installment amount is paid by the last day of February, the entire yearâ€™s taxes become due and payable in full and incur interest charges from March 1st.

**Tax bills are mailed in January. Further installment bills are mailed in April and July.**
