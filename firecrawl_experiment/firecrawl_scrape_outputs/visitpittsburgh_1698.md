# Unique Date Nights in Pittsburgh

Celebrate the one you love with these unique Pittsburgh date night ideas!

If you're like me, Pittsburgh is your one true love. With so many fun and romantic [things to do](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/things-to-do/) in the city, Valentine's Day is a great excuse to get out and try something new! Whether you're looking to shake things up or keep it simple, celebrating with friends or a significant other, there are plenty of ways to make it a lovely day.

## Hands-On Activities

Get creative, make something to remember or just have some fun creating something or being active:

- Still need to shop for Valentine's Gifts? Skip the box of chocolates and flowers and get your someone special something high quality, local and handmade at [I Made It! Market](https://www.imadeitmarket.com/i-made-it-market-event-calendar/2024/1/3/i-made-it-mine-at-the-block-northway) Feb. 8 at The Block Northway.
- Take a class at the [Pittsburgh Glass Center](https://www.pittsburghglasscenter.org/) for a one-of-a-kind, hands-on experience with some truly talented artisans. For Valentine's Day, try their Make-It-A-Date events and created a sculpture glass flower Feb. 14 or stemless wine glass Feb. 21.
- Be a [Paint Monkey](http://beapaintmonkey.com/)! Fun for private parties, groups or a romantic evening, this class makes it easy to be an artist! Guests are welcome to bring wine, beer and snacks. Check out their Valentines Open Studio with a bottle of wine and your sweetheart to paint couples paintings, pre-sketched canvasses and more—TBA 2025.
- Create a custom flower arrangement with [Root + Bloom](https://www.rootandbloomflowers.com/book-online) (TBA 2025), that includes instruction and all materials. BYOB, too!

Lebo, Cranberry) and let your axe satisfyingly slam into wooden targets. Coaches help train you before your session to make this activity fun for all skill levels.
- Celebrate love at [Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/kamin-science-center/)'s [21+ Night](http://carnegiesciencecenter.org/individuals-and-families/science-after-hours/?utm_source=ecard&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=21-plus-night-vikings-01-26&utm_term=science-after-hours): Seductive Science on Feb. 14, 2025 where you can see a beating gallium "heart," explore relationships of the animal kingdom and enjoy the stars of the Buhl Planetarium.

## Sit Back and Relax

Enjoy a special experience while someone else does the work with one of these mesmerizing activities.

- If beer and a movie is more your speed, check out the adjoined [Row House Cinema](http://rowhousecinema.com/) and [Bierport](http://bierportpgh.com/) in Lawrenceville. Pick up some craft brews (they'll even chill the beers for you!) and take them over to see a film from 2025's lineup of "Love Bites" like _Deep Blue Sea_ and _Secret Shark Movie Hint_ _._
