# Towing License

In order for the owner or operator of a non-residential parking place/lot to remove or have a vehicle removed from the parking place lot, the City of Pittsburgh requires the person to obtain an annual limited towing license. The requirement does not apply to abandoned vehicles. Inspections are completed to insure that the parking place/lot meet applicable PennDOT Signage Regulations, and that the name and contact info of the towing company are prominently displayed.
