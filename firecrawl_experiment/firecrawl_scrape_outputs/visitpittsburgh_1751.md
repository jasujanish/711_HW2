# Burgh Bound from Buffalo \| Student Perspectives

Great connections. An incredible campus. Energetic Downtown. There's lots of reasons to love being a college student in Pittsburgh.

Incoming Students and their families,

Welcome to college! My name is Nicholas Monetti, and I would love to give you all a warm welcome to Pittsburgh. If you're a Pitt student like me, then congratulations!

The University of Pittsburgh is such a special school, and you all made the right choice to fully commit to being a Panther. As a rising sophomore majoring in Accounting and Finance, I have first-hand experience of why Pitt was the right choice.

Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, I knew I wanted to attend college out of state. Even though I love the Buffalo Bills and chicken wings, I wanted to attend a college where I would be able to enjoy a bigger city environment while not being too far from home. As an athlete, I remember loving the city of Pittsburgh when we visited for hockey and baseball tournaments. So, I decided to tour Pitt.

## Oakland: The Perfect College Campus Location

Turns out, Pitt became my dream school, as the school has strong academics, an awesome student body, and the city is a lot like Buffalo. I am now in love with Pitt and the city of Pittsburgh, and I don’t regret anything.

Pitt has so many benefits that many people take for granted, and I am here to emphasize these benefits for you. As Pitt resides in the [Oakland neighborhood](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/oakland/) of Pittsburgh, you get the best of both worlds: a college town and the city.

Located just outside the city, Oakland is full of life during the school year. All the students are passionate about what they do, keeping Oakland full of energy. When the school day is over, though, there are so many fun little things to do, and there is never a dull moment.

From [restaurants to eat at](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pittsburgh-dining-guide-oakland-neighborhood/) to museums to visit, there is so much to do in case you ever get bored. I love exploring Oakland with all my friends, creating lifelong memories. Do not take Oakland for granted, for you may have some of the best moments of your life here.

## Enjoying the Best of Downtown Pittsburgh

But, the city of Pittsburgh is truly my favorite part of being a Pitt student. I love how I can enjoy a nice day of classes and then take a quick [bus ride](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/a-weekend-around-pittsburgh-by-bus-student-perspectives/) downtown in the evening. With my Panther ID, I can get downtown for free and enjoy all the perks of the city.

I specifically love how Pittsburgh is just the right size that there is [enough to do](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/things-to-do/free-things-to-do/) without getting overwhelmed. This will be many students' first time living on their own, and the city of Pittsburgh is a safe while also fun option to start things off.

My parents love Pittsburgh so much that we have already formed a new tradition in our new favorite city. Every weekend they come down to visit me, we attend a [sporting event](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/things-to-do/pittsburgh-sports-teams/), using my student discount, and then get a milkshake at The Milk Shake Factory, located right on Forbes Ave.

Pitt and the city of Pittsburgh have a special place in our hearts now. The city is truly an awesome place, so take time to explore it.

## Making Connections

Pitt being so close to the city is also very beneficial for future job careers, too. Specifically, for me, a business major, I love how every semester, there are Career Fairs for me to attend. Employers from many recognized companies right Downtown can easily come to campus and connect with us students.

Because Pitt is known for producing such well-rounded individuals, employers love coming to visit. With Pitt’s credibility and efforts to allow me to excel, I am confident in saying that I will get my dream job, and I am just a sophomore. I have already built strong connections with so many employers, and I don’t think I would’ve had this opportunity if I went anywhere else.

In short, even if you're not a Pitt student, you all will have a great experience here as a college student in the city of Pittsburgh. If you spend time taking advantage of all the benefits, balancing schoolwork with your social life, you will have the best four years of your life. Pittsburgh is my new home, and I hope you all make it your home as well.
