McKinley Park is nestled between Pittsburgh's Beltzhoover, Bon Air, and Knoxville neighborhoods. The 79- acre park boasts historic trees, basketball courts, playgrounds, a skate park, and woodland trails.

It is also home to a mural called "Home Court Advantage," inspired by the positive role that the McKinley Park basketball courts have played in residents' lives.

The Lower McKinley Park shelter is available for rent at [https://registerparks.pittsburghpa.gov/Default.aspx?id=1](https://registerparks.pittsburghpa.gov/Default.aspx?id=1).

**Founded in 1898 as Maple Park.**

Mckinley Park was purchased from Thomas Maple on May 10, 1898, at a cost of $63,000 and consisted of 63 acres of wooded hillsides and ravines.

The residents of Knoxville and Beltzhoover knew the park by such names as Butcher's Grove, Maple Park and Ritter's Hollow. It was renamed McKinley Park in 1902 after the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901.
