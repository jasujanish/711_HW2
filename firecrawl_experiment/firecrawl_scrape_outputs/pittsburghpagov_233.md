_Online payment collected by Magic Collection Solutions_

Attention: Effective September 2, 2024 all Request to Purchase applications must be submitted through our [online portal](https://public-pgh.epropertyplus.com/landmgmtpub/app/base/landing). Paper applications and applications sent via email will no longer be accepted. A $25 application fee per property will apply.

The Real Estate Division of the Department of Finance accepts questions from the general public for purchase of properties.

The City makes certain that the requested property is not needed for public improvement. The prospective purchaser submits a request to become a qualified buyer.

A qualified buyer is one who:

- has paid taxes, water, sewage, etc.
- is in compliance with City codes and policies.

The approved prospective purchaser is notified of the price in the response letter to the Request to Purchase form.

## Pilot Home Buying Program

###### This new initiative is designed to remove longstanding legal and procedural barriers that have prevented many residents from acquiring homes directly from the City.

###### “The goal is to make homeownership more accessible for Pittsburghers and reduce the red tape that’s too often stood in the way,” said Mayor Ed Gainey.

# - **OPEN HOUSES -**

# 10/18/2025 - From 12pm - 3pm

_\*Feel free to bring your contractor or inspector with you_
