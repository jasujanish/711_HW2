| Statement from Mayor Gainey on First Anniversary of January 6 Insurrection | FOR IMMIDIATE RELEASE: Thursday, January 6, 2022 <br>Media Contact<br>[press@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:press@pittsburghpa.gov)<br>412-352-4674<br>**Statement from Mayor Gainey on First Anniversary of January 6 Insurrection**<br>**PITTSBURGH** – On the one-year anniversary of the January 6 Insurrection on the United States Capitol and attempted subversion of democracy, Mayor Gainey released the following statement:<br>“Last year, the heartbeat of our country’s democracy was attacked in a violent insurrection on our nation's Capitol. Since then, I have witnessed deliberate and malicious efforts in the Pennsylvania General Assembly to attack the legitimacy of the 2020 election, attempts at a sham “audit” and  efforts to roll back access to the ballot box by ending mail-in voting. Far right-wing extremists have been emboldened and without question there is division throughout our country. These challenges cannot be avoided blindly, but rather must be addressed directly through a lens of justice and freedom. Where there is division and inequity there is also an opportunity for unity and growth. While gerrymandered maps distort representation in the General Assembly, redistricting this year provides the single greatest opportunity in decades to ensure fair maps in Pennsylvania. Most importantly, in the United States Congress, there is an opportunity to ensure every American’s inalienable right to participate in free and fair elections remains true. Congress must pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act in order to protect our democracy, ensure everyone has access to the ballot box, and get dark money out of politics. The time is now.” <br>Mayor Gainey stands with US Attorney General Merrick Garland and the US Justice Department's dedicated servants for their commitment that "those involved must be held accountable, and \[that\] there is no higher priority for the Department of Justice."<br>### | 6/1/2022 11:56:30 |

Former Mayor Bill Peduto introduced the zoning text amendment personally, making the Office of the Mayor the applicant, and thus the party responsible for requesting a continuance. When Gainey assumed office on 1/3/2022, he also assumed the role of applicant in this case. In order to provide clarity on the technical language and ensure equitable development is prioritized by the City of Pittsburgh zoning code, more time is necessary to update the proposed legislative text. Over the next 30 days the Gainey Administration will engage with community and student groups, housing justice advocates, and the developer to devise a path forward.<br>Mayor Gainey released the following statement:<br>“I have formally requested this continuance to allow the Department of City Planning to review and make recommendations on the existing OPR-E legislative text. I look forward to discussions on this development and those across Pittsburgh and how they can promote equity and affordable housing. My administration will be engaging community and student groups, housing justice advocates, and the developer as we continue this work. I want to thank the developer and Councilman Kraus for their willingness to collaborate with the Department of City Planning even if it means extending the project’s timeline. I am hopeful we will find a solution that prioritizes equitable development, aligns with the priorities raised by residents in the Oakland Plan process, and delivers on much needed affordable housing prospects for the people of Pittsburgh.”<br>### | 10/1/2022 11:53:26 |

| Mayor Ed Gainey Joins Mayors Against Illegal Guns in Honor of Fourth Annual National Gun Violence Survivors Week | **Mayor Ed Gainey Joins Mayors Against Illegal Guns in Honor of Fourth Annual National Gun Violence Survivors Week**<br>**PITTSBURGH** – To honor those personally impacted by gun violence and mark the start of the fourth annual National Gun Violence Survivors Week taking place February 1-7, Mayor Ed Gainey announced today that he has joined [Mayors Against Illegal Guns](http://mayors.everytown.org/), a national nonpartisan coalition of more than 1,000 current and former mayors committed to ending gun violence in communities across America. These leaders implement and advocate for life-saving gun safety reforms from local programs and municipal ordinances to local, state, and federal legislation. While their backgrounds may differ, they speak with one voice – united against gun violence for the sake of saving lives.<br>“I am honored to join this coalition of mayors,” said Mayor Gainey. “The proliferation of illegal guns in our country poses a serious threat to public safety. As mayor, I will continue to advocate for common sense gun reform at the local, state and federal level. It is up to us to ensure the safety of our communities and our country.”<br>By early February, more people are killed with guns in the United States than are killed with guns in any other high-income country in an entire year. And millions more are shot and wounded, threatened with a gun, or witness an act of gun violence. The gun death rate in the United States is 13 times that of our peer countries. National Gun Violence Survivors Week is a time to share and amplify the stories and voices of gun violence survivors who live with the impact of gun violence every day.<br>“Behind every staggering gun violence statistic are the stories of individuals, families and communities who live with the lifelong trauma from gun violence,” said Keenon M. James, director of the Everytown Survivor Network. “I know their pain because in 1993, my brother, Sean, was shot and killed in Takoma Park, Maryland. More than just my brother, he was a son, a husband, a father, and a friend. By joining Mayors Against Illegal Guns during National Gun Violence Survivors Week, Mayor Ed Gainey is showing his commitment to stand with families like mine across the country and demand action on gun violence. “<br>As a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Mayor Gainey is committed to reducing gun violence in Pittsburgh. Mayor Gainey pledges to do all they can to keep firearms out of the wrong hands and encourage responsible gun ownership to keep the community safe.<br>The centerpiece of Gun Violence Survivors Week is [**Moments That Survive**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/dqskwc/x90z7hb/dm1oej), a year-round digital storytelling site and campaign in which Americans across the country share defining details of their experiences, in their own words. Moments That Survive builds community among gun violence survivors and helps the public understand how everyday life changes as a result of gun violence. All told, [58 percent](https://t.e2ma.net/click/dqskwc/x90z7hb/te2oej) of American adults, including 68 percent of Black and Latinx Americans, are survivors of gun violence, either experiencing gun violence themselves or caring for someone who has experienced gun violence in their lifetime.<br>**About Mayors Against Illegal Guns**<br>Since its creation in April 2006, Mayors Against Illegal Guns has grown from 15 mayors of major American cities to more than 1,000 current and former mayors. The nonpartisan coalition has united mayors, gun violence survivors and everyday Americans around these common goals: advancing enforcement and data collection strategies to prevent gun violence; investing in survivor services and violence intervention programs to address gun violence; and advocating for gun safety legislation at the local, state, and federal level. Mayors Against Illegal Guns is a joint program of Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund and Everytown for Gun Safety, the largest gun violence prevention organization in the country with over eight million supporters and more than 375,000 donors.

Temperatures are expected to be below freezing throughout the winter event followed by single digit temperatures on Saturday.<br>Department of Public Works (DPW) crews will start shifts at 6:00 p.m. Wednesday and will work throughout Thursday and overnight into Friday to treat and clear streets, but commuters should plan for difficult conditions. Due to the preceding rain before the wintery mix, DPW cannot pre-treat the roads. Crews will be sent out as the weather transitions from rain to snow early Thursday morning. There will be approximately 40 trucks on overnight shifts and 60 trucks during the day. Park crews will hand-clear steps, sidewalks, and bridges. As always, the City’s emergency services are ready to assist residents in need.<br>Due to the icy conditions, DPW response may be slowed as trucks may need to back up steep streets to provide service, as opposed to traveling downhill. This is done for the safety of our drivers but may lengthen the time it takes to clear side streets. DPW advises all motorists to avoid travel during the period of the winter storm as much as possible. Those with the ability to work from home should do so.<br>“Throughout this winter weather event, I want to urge all Pittsburghers to stay home if possible,” said Mayor Gainey. “The forecasted freezing rain, then ice, then snow is the worst combination for road conditions. If you must, drive slowly and leave space for our salt trucks to work. I have recommended that all City of Pittsburgh employees work from home on Thursday and Friday if possible. Remember that we’re all expected to clear the sidewalk immediately in front of our homes. If you have a neighbor who will struggle with that requirement, be a Snow Angel and give them a hand. And again, I want to express my thanks to our DPW workers who work tirelessly to keep our streets clear.”<br>Out of a concern for worker safety, Environmental Services will suspend all garbage and collection services for Friday. These are rescheduled to Saturday. At this time, services will continue with standard operating procedures on Thursday. Any change to Thursday’s collection service will be posted on the City of Pittsburgh’s social media sites.<br>Steep and problematic portions of the following streets will be closed beginning Thursday morning between 8:00 – 9:00 a.m. until conditions allow us to reopen safely.<br>- Capitol Avenue<br>- Newett Street<br>- Copperfield Street<br>- South Negley Avenue<br>- Suffolk Street<br>- Rialto Street<br>_A correction to this press release was posted at 6:39 p.m. noting that the winter weather is expected to start Wednesday Night._ | 2/2/2022 18:10:06 |

It implemented many innovative code practices that require the use of future climate rainfall projections as part of current stormwater design procedures. The City of Pittsburgh is one of the first cities to require these practices, based on extensive national and international peer reviewed research, review of global climate trends, and historic rainfall data trends. The SCORU Project demonstrated sensitivity to the community needs, safety, and forward-thinking actions that will provide a vital improvement to current practices.<br>The first round of stormwater management requirements was implemented in March 2019, to comply with state and federal mandates such as Pennsylvania Act 167 and the Allegheny County Model Stormwater Management Ordinance. However, it was understood that more comprehensive analysis, community engagement, and additional recommendations were needed for the consolidation and improvement of municipal stormwater policies, processes, and codes. This led to the SCORU Project kickoff in 2020. These updates were made possible by collaboration and engagement across the City, external agencies such as PWSA, and multiple stakeholder groups.<br>“Good stormwater management is necessary to ensure the health and safety of Pittsburghers by providing stable environmental and economic conditions through improved water quality, reduced flooding, and green infrastructure,” said Senior Environmental Planner Martina Battistone. “We are honored that our team’s hard work on these code updates has been recognized and look forward to the rollout.”<br>The updates to the Stormwater Code were accepted in October 2021 and will go into effect on March 31, 2022.

| MAYOR GAINEY ANNOUNCES LANDMARK DEAL WITH WALNUT CAPITAL ON PROPOSED OAKLAND ZONING | **MAYOR GAINEY ANNOUNCES LANDMARK DEAL WITH WALNUT CAPITAL ON** **PROPOSED OAKLAND ZONING**<br>_Gainey administration wins key concessions on affordable housing and equitable development_<br>**Pittsburgh –** Mayor Gainey announced today an agreement with the developer Walnut Capital on the proposed zoning for the Oakland Crossings project. The deal includes narrower and more clearly defined zoning and a public benefits agreement that covers affordable housing, food access, MWBE contracting, and will create 250 good paying union construction jobs.<br>“From the first day we walked into office I told my team that any development must move us forward on making Pittsburgh more equitable and affordable for everyone,” said Mayor Gainey. “This agreement is the first time a private developer has committed to using the Housing Authority Choice Voucher Program to reach inclusionary zoning requirements in Pittsburgh’s history and will include a new grocery store that will bring much needed options for fresh food to this neighborhood.”<br>"We thank Mayor Gainey and his hard working team for their leadership,” said Todd Reidbord president of Walnut Capital. “First, they took the time to listen. Then, they raised the bar higher on what's possible, motivating us to roll up our sleeves further and think bigger. We worked together to problem solve innovative ways that ensure the community receives its long-awaited grocery store and that we can build a sustainable, affordable, inclusive mixed-use development that lifts up everyone in the community.  Oakland Crossings will be a national model of how this can be done."<br>Mayor Gainey and his administration have been meeting with residents and stakeholders over the past two months in order to listen about what their priorities are for development in their neighborhood. Through this deliberate process the Mayor was able to ensure that any development is in line with the community goals identified through the Oakland Neighborhood Planning process and with his vision on creating a city for all.<br>“This agreement shows what can happen when we center the needs of our communities,” said Councilman Bruce Kraus. “This public benefits agreement is the result of listening to residents, students, and small businesses and addresses their concerns around equitable growth for their neighborhood. This deal will help Pittsburgh grow while ensuring fairness and inclusivity for all of us.”<br>Moving to a phased approach for this project has led to a smaller overall footprint for the zoning, protection of Zulema Park, expanded green space, and ensures that multifamily residential developments will include at least 10% of units at rent that are affordable to households at or below 50% of the area median income for a minimum of 35 years.<br>“My priority has been to make sure that Pittsburgh remains livable for all of us,” Mayor Gainey Added “But we have to create new opportunities for economic growth, pathways towards prosperity, and inclusive equitable development that helps us keep people here.” <br>These changes will be on the agenda for the Planning Commission meeting on Tuesday, March 8 to be presented for their review and recommendation to City Council.<br>A copy of the public benefits agreement can be found at [http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17546\_combinepdf.pdf](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/17546_combinepdf.pdf)<br>_###_ | 7/3/2022 14:28:10 |

Consequently, we saw a rise in litter in streets as well as debris and waste entering our storm water system.”<br>The resumed enforcement will allow crews to perform a more thorough cleaning. “Not only does this have positive impacts for our storm water system, but it also leaves Pittsburgh streets cleaner for residents,” Acting Director Chris Hornstein added.<br>Street sweepers operate every day of the week, with neighborhoods focused on Monday through Thursday.

| Pittsburgh Recognized for Exceptional Use of Data and Evidence to Improve Residents' Lives | FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>**Pittsburgh Recognized for Exceptional Use of Data and Evidence to Improve Residents’ Lives**<br>_Pittsburgh is One of Only 55 Cities in the U.S. to Achieve What Works Cities Certification_<br>**PITTSBURGH** — Pittsburgh is proud to announce that it has achieved What Works Cities Certification in recognition of its exceptional use of data to guide decision-making and improve residents’ lives. What Works Cities Certification - the national standard of excellence in data-driven city governance - evaluates how well cities are managed by measuring the extent to which city leaders incorporate data and evidence in their decision-making. What Works Cities Certification, a national Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative led by Results for America, has awarded Certification to 55 U.S. cities for outstanding data practices since 2017.<br>“It is a tremendous honor to be among just 55 cities across the country to receive the What Works Cities Certification,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “This certification is an acknowledgment of good governance and great teamwork across multiple departments. Our work is just beginning, and we are excited to continue building towards gold certification in the coming year.” <br>What Works Cities Certification assesses cities based on their [data-driven decision-making practices](https://medium.com/what-works-cities-certification/what-works-cities-certification-assessment-guide-5c514f1dff1b), such as whether they are using data to set goals and track progress, allocate funding, evaluate the effectiveness of programs, and achieve desired outcomes from contracts with outside vendors. The program also measures whether cities are publicly and transparently communicating about their use of data and evidence. Each city that participates in Certification receives a customized city assessment that highlights their unique strengths and opportunities for improvement. What Works Cities partners then provide coaching, training, and technical assistance to help city leaders improve their data and evidence capabilities, embrace new practices aligned to the Certification standard, and drive outcomes for their community.<br>"Receiving Silver Certification from the Bloomberg What Works Cities program is a meaningful recognition of the hard work many of our colleagues across multiple departments have executed over the past two years," said Director of Innovation and Performance Heidi Norman.  "It is also an announcement to the residents of Pittsburgh that their municipal government cares deeply about the data collected, how it is governed, secured, and shared - all towards twin goals of vastly improved performance and transparency about our operations and services provided to the community. And finally, Silver Certification for Pittsburgh is a beginning; it is the 'starting gun' for us to build upon this foundation and to leverage the resources provided by Bloomberg What Works Cities to go for the gold!"<br>Over the past year, Pittsburgh has demonstrated measurable progress on these foundational data practices. Some notable examples of the city’s use of data include:<br>- Pittsburgh’s open data platforms are empowering city planners to create evidence-based [neighborhood plans](https://medium.com/department-of-innovation-performance/open-data-is-helping-neighborhoods-plan-for-the-future-6ea9b00e58eb) in the Homewood, Manchester-Chateau, and Hazelwood neighborhoods with an eye towards economic development, sustainability, and equity.<br>  <br>- Since the establishment of Pittsburgh’s [Department of Innovation & Performance](https://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/) in 2014, the city has looked to coordinate with local and regional partners to centralize data, foster collaboration, and share governance best practices<br>  <br>- 311 data is helping measure how equitably city services are being deployed.

Cities are [awarded](https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/certification/) Silver, Gold, or Platinum Certification depending on their level of data sophistication. Fifty-five cities have achieved Certification.<br>“Cities using data are more resilient and better able to respond in crisis situations and service delivery,” said Lauren Su, Director of What Works Cities Certification. “ _Pittsburgh has done an outstanding job of using_ _311 call data to both measure whether city services are being equitably deployed, and to evaluate outcomes for city contracts, ensuring their investments are meeting the needs of residents_ _._ This is what excellence in data-driven government looks like.”<br>Pittsburgh is proud to join an elite group of cities leading a growing movement of data-driven decision-making in jurisdictions around the country. A [report](https://results4america.org/tools/closing-the-data-gap-how-cities-are-delivering-better-results-for-residents/) released last fall by the Monitor Institute at Deloitte, in collaboration with What Works Cities, detailed the increase in cities using data to drive decision-making and the benefits of this approach for residents. Since 2015, the percentage of cities tracking progress toward key goals has more than doubled (from 30% to 75%), the percentage of cities engaging with residents on a goal and communicating progress has more than tripled (from 19% to 70%), the percentage of cities with a platform and process to release data to the public has more than tripled (from 18% to 67%), and the percentage of cities modifying their programs based on data analytics has more than doubled (from 28% to 61%). These are several of the data practices assessed as part of What Works Cities Certification.<br>Certification was developed by a team of experts from Results for America in close consultation with the [What Works Cities Certification Standard Committee](https://medium.com/what-works-cities-certification/meet-the-what-works-cities-certification-standard-committee-524ed1394c74) and with support from other What Works Cities partners - The Government Performance Lab at the Harvard Kennedy School, The Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University, and The Behavioral Insights Team. Over 200 cities have completed a [Certification assessment](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4620807/NEW-2018-Certification-Application), benchmarking their practices against the national standard. <br>#####<br>**About What Works Cities:**<br>What Work Cities, a Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative, helps cities use data and evidence to tackle their most pressing challenges and improve residents’ lives.

We are in the process of being able to connect the families with counseling and supportive services they will need to help them through this tragedy. My administration has launched a critical incident review to get a deeper understanding as to the root cause of the violence last night and we plan to release what we find as soon as we are able to.  <br>If we are going to find peace in our communities we must find justice. All of us as a city must continue to come together as one community to solve these murders and find justice for these families. We are going to do everything we can to find those responsible for these actions.  <br>We are facing a pandemic of gun violence in our city and we need a public health response. When we held our community meeting in Homewood we came together in conversation about our vision for zero gun deaths in our community – but we also came together to uplift and celebrate the neighborhood and hear about the pride that people have about their community.  <br>We know that our goal is going to be hard to accomplish, but that doesn’t mean that we should be afraid to try to find a path to peace in Homewood and in every neighborhood in Pittsburgh. <br>It is time to end the pandemic of violence that is taking the lives of too many young people in our city. <br>### | 31/3/2022 10:50:42 |
| The City of Pittsburgh's Changes to the Stormwater Code Are Now in Effect | **The City of Pittsburgh’s Changes to the Stormwater Code Are Now in Effect**<br>PITTSBURGH, PA — The Stormwater Code and Ordinance Review Updates (SCORU) went into effect yesterday, rolling out a revised code, supporting policy and process recommendations and guidance materials aligning with many important City initiatives regarding green stormwater infrastructure, complete streets, and resiliency.<br>Stormwater management code defines regulations for how stormwater is managed on development and redevelopment sites that meet certain thresholds and criteria. These requirements help to ensure that new development does not contribute to stormwater issues. Development must mitigate stormwater in ways that helps alleviate flooding and basement backups, reduce combined sewer overflows, and reduce pollutant levels in our waterways.<br>The SCORU Project began in 2020 to consolidate and improve municipal stormwater policies, processes, and codes after the first round of stormwater management requirements were implemented in March 2019. Together, the Department of City Planning, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), and multiple stakeholder groups conducted comprehensive analyses and community engagement and gathered additional recommendations to encourage consolidation and improvement options across agencies.<br>“One of our goals in this process was to clarify development requirements for applicants,” said Senior Environmental Planner Martina Battistone. “This partnership allowed us to improve stormwater management City-wide making the code more user-friendly for developers and designers.”<br>In February 2022, the SCORU Project was awarded the 2021 Civil Engineering Award of Merit from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Pittsburgh Section because of its emphasis on the need to change forecasting to account for climate change. It implemented many innovative code practices that require the use of future rainfall projections as part of current stormwater design procedures.

| County Executive, Mayor Launch Hygiene Kit Drive for Ukraine | **County Executive, Mayor Launch Hygiene Kit Drive for Ukraine**<br>_Cooperative Effort with Brother’s Brother Foundation Runs from April 18-29_<br>**PITTSBURGH –** County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and City of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey today announced a hygiene kit drive to benefit those impacted by the crisis in Ukraine. The collection, beginning on Monday, April 18 and running through Friday, April 29, will collect hygiene kits and items for those hygiene kits that will be assembled, shipped, and then distributed to refugees and others impacted by the crisis. Brother’s Brother Foundation is partnering with the county and city on this collection and will coordinate shipping of the hygiene kits.<br>“One thing about western Pennsylvanians and Pittsburghers, we come together and help folks in need,” said Fitzgerald. “There is a huge number of people of Ukrainian heritage here in western Pennsylvania and we have been asked over and over what can be done to help those in Ukraine. Coordinating this drive for hygiene kits is just one small way to have a big impact and we are grateful to everyone who has committed to participating.”<br>As individuals continue to flee their homes in the Ukraine, one of the greatest needs is just basic, hygiene items. Because the kits are also small, fitting into a one-gallon closeable plastic bag, they can also be carried with individuals fairly easily.<br>“The people of Pittsburgh are proud to do all that they can to support those in need in Ukraine,” said Gainey. “These hygiene kits are essential supplies for everyone who has had to flee their homes because of this unjust war. By coming together as one community, we are able to provide these kits to all who need them, and Pittsburgh will continue to stand with you during this time of crisis. Thank you to everyone in our community that has worked to make this happen – and to everyone who will participate.”<br>From Monday, April 18 through Friday, April 29, residents can drop off full hygiene kits (preferred) or items that can be assembled into the kits. Kits will be shipped overseas, so all liquid items should be sealed with packing tape. The kits should NOT include aerosols or powders, and money or notes should also not be put in the kits.<br>Each hygiene kit should include:<br>- Deodorant (travel size, no larger than 3.4 ounces)<br>- Shampoo (travel size, no larger than 3.4 ounces)<br>- Conditioner (travel size, no larger than 3.4 ounces)<br>- Body wash (travel size, no larger than 3.4 ounces)<br>- Lotion (no larger than 3.4 ounces)<br>- Hand Sanitizer (travel size, no larger than 3.4 ounces)<br>- Toothpaste (travel size, no larger than 3.4 ounces)<br>- Toothbrush<br>- Chapstick (1.5 inches in length/ 0.5 inch in diameter)<br>- Flushable wipes (travel size)<br>- Tissues (travel size)<br>- Tampons<br>- Sanitary pads<br>Also accepted are items included in the list above which will be assembled for donation.<br>A map of all collection sites can be [found here](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexperience.arcgis.com%2Fexperience%2Fb272af175dcb4a3cb76e0f3608f913ee%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cpress%40pittsburghpa.gov%7Cfe8c9c37522840e513be08da1e1fa9ce%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C0%7C637855418604695274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=xpL%2Bsa%2BM4OFkHuE7I3ho8gCrF1EBczhTsaffZwNsjdE%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/b272af175dcb4a3cb76e0f3608f913ee/.

| City of Pittsburgh Begins Street Milling and Paving Next Week | **City of Pittsburgh Begins Street Milling and Paving Next Week**<br>**PITTSBURGH** — The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is beginning its 2022 milling and paving program next week.<br>This year the city is investing over $12.5 million in the street resurfacing program, which supports asphalt street resurfacing and ADA curb ramp upgrades on paved streets throughout Pittsburgh.     <br>DOMI is responsible for over 1,000 miles of roadway. Approximately 39 miles of streets will be resurfaced this year. Additional mileage will be resurfaced through cooperative agreements with local public utilities. Mechanical patching and crack sealing will improve many additional miles by addressing particular trouble spots on otherwise acceptable street corridors, stretching the city’s tax dollars further.<br>DOMI works with community groups, council members, and 311 to identify potential issues in the right-of-way regarding street surface conditions. DOMI's staff and engineers create a yearly list based off of the following criteria:<br>- **Street Overall Condition Index (OCI)** \- Every street in Pittsburgh has an OCI score based upon the physical condition. Once the condition of the street deteriorates past a certain threshold it is given additional priority on the paving list. DOMI takes an additional step by field-verifying the condition of streets to make sure that the highest need streets are prioritized.<br>- **Street Use** \- Streets are broken into three categories: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary. Primary roads receive the most use, which results in their OCI score dropping more quickly than Secondary or Tertiary.<br>- **Equity** \- Historically, some districts in the city have had a higher average condition score than other districts. DOMI takes this into consideration when allocating the paving budget, to make sure that communities that were historically underserved receive greater resources to raise the condition of their roads.<br>Once a street has been resurfaced, DOMI works with either city crews or a contractor to restore, and in some cases, improve, the pavement markings that are in place. In addition, new ADA curb ramps along a section of street that is repaved are required to be brought up to current standards. This year DOMI expects to update approximately 1,200 curb ramps. If upgrades are needed, they are performed the year following street paving.<br>Non-asphalt—concrete, brick, and cobblestone—streets are not part of the city’s paving program due to the increased complexity and cost associated with them. Typically, these streets are included as their own separate projects within the city’s capital budget. In an effort to preserve these long-lasting materials, DOMI’s primary approach is to perform repairs to these streets. Council legislation is required in order convert a concrete, brick, or cobblestone street to asphalt.<br>The City expects to begin paving on April 18. Streets scheduled for upcoming paving will be posted weekly on DOMI’s website.<br>The full schedule for the week, including details on intersections, [is available here](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/paving-schedule).<br>### | 14/4/2022 16:21:34 |

| The City of Pittsburgh Releases Community Visioning Studies for the East Hills and Lincoln-Lemington Belmar | **The City of Pittsburgh Releases Community Visioning Studies for the East Hills and Lincoln-** **Lemington** **Belmar**<br>**PITTSBURGH, PA**— The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning has completed inaugural Neighborhood Visioning Plans for the East Hills and Lincoln-Lemington Belmar neighborhoods. Each plan was developed through a 14-month process with the East Hills Consensus Group and the Lincoln Lemington Collaborative with support from the office of Councilman Rev. Ricky Burgess.   <br>Neighborhood Visioning allows residents and business and property owners to identify a unified vision for their neighborhood. In doing so, they create and adopt a comprehensive plan that will be the focus of future revitalization and reinvestment actions. The vision is composed of goals, objectives, and values that make up each neighborhood.<br>“I applaud the East Hills Consensus Group and the Lincoln Lemington Collaborative for their work in developing these Neighborhood Visioning Plans,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “It is critical that we plan for growth in our communities in a smart, efficient and intentional manner. These plans will help protect the integrity of our neighborhoods.”<br>“In my experience with neighborhood redevelopment, you have to plan first,” said Councilman Burgess. “Thank you to the East Hills Consensus Group and Lincoln-Lemington Collaborative for their participation, leadership, and commitment to developing a vision for these neighborhoods. These plans provide us with a common vision by which we can collectively support their neighborhood to realize their vision.”  <br>The plan recommends community, development, mobility, and infrastructure strategies to be implemented over the next two to five years. Each community group will continue to work with the Department of City Planning, organizations, authorities, and other stakeholders to implement these strategies and realize their vision.<br>**East Hills Vision**<br>East Hills Residents are working toward building a safe, vibrant, and unified neighborhood to offer accessible parks, locally grown businesses, and a variety of housing.  <br>**Lincoln-** **Lemington** **Belmar Vision**<br>Lincoln-Lemington Belmar is a welcoming, family-friendly neighborhood that boasts mixed-income housing, a growing local business community, amenities, safe parks and recreation, and dependable public transportation.  <br>"A community vision plan is necessary to move a community forward. Working with City Planning has been a process, particularly during COVID,” said Diane Daniels, Founder of the East Hills Consensus Group. “We are excited for the next steps. The implementation means progress and change. Something that's needed in East Hills. Our goal is to become renewed and vibrant.”  <br>The Department of City Planning strives to build strong connections within Pittsburgh neighborhoods that create belonging and trust among residents. This process was designed to find consensus around each community's values, discover shared goals, and engage residents at every step to ensure they have an active role in their neighborhood’s planning processes.<br>“The Lincoln-Lemington Collaborative is excited to have completed the Visioning Plan with our neighbors and community organizations. We are looking forward to implementing the plan and working with the community in an effort to build a more unified, safer, and healthier Lincoln-Lemington Belmar,” said Sandra Glass of the Lincoln Lemington Collaborative.<br>The draft plans are available for review on EngagePGH. <br>-        East Hills: [https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/east-hills-visioning-study](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__engage.pittsburghpa.gov_east-2Dhills-2Dvisioning-2Dstudy%26d%3DDwMF-g%26c%3DeuGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM%26r%3De79eqamYwL-U1vxbWeuy3pLfH1dEogQdEOCUFzob8zk%26m%3D8Xs7t2WVW1-l_3lAZAwwc_UpeVkF3GuN4lll36Uzuqg%26s%3D4tPbrt0oYIir8zBoOPGfFmqAw5ed2X-2ys4BN6D3K8k%26e%3D&data=05%7C01%7CMaria.Montano%40pittsburghpa.gov%7C4f1f0fc16a5547f21b4108da336c219b%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C0%7C637878836759934465%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=WnrQW4xOF14faLLRpxVO9s4iZvkwnCw6%2Fx2AhHd9fhc%3D&reserved=0)<br>-        Lincoln-Lemington Belmar: [https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/lincoln-lemington-belmar-visioning-plan](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__engage.pittsburghpa.gov_lincoln-2Dlemington-2Dbelmar-2Dvisioning-2Dplan%26d%3DDwMF-g%26c%3DeuGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM%26r%3De79eqamYwL-U1vxbWeuy3pLfH1dEogQdEOCUFzob8zk%26m%3D8Xs7t2WVW1-l_3lAZAwwc_UpeVkF3GuN4lll36Uzuqg%26s%3DJnHxgeocKGYudXH4J7_d8n0gz4ASZl2rixkqPYhkOQ8%26e%3D&data=05%7C01%7CMaria.Montano%40pittsburghpa.gov%7C4f1f0fc16a5547f21b4108da336c219b%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C0%7C637878836759934465%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=KJoPd2SE4Qyk56cCvJs8NQYsMb%2BkpfHtN9HY424YXhg%3D&reserved=0) | 11/5/2022 15:39:34 |

| Fitzgerald, Gainey Create Intimate Partner Violence Reform Leadership Team | **Fitzgerald, Gainey Create Intimate Partner Violence Reform Leadership Team**<br>_Team to Provide Leadership, Strategic Direction in Coordinating Policy, System Work_<br>**PITTSBURGH –** County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and City of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey today announced the creation of an Intimate Partner Violence Reform Leadership Team. The leadership team is being created to provide leadership and strategic direction in coordinating policy and system level work across agencies to improve a complex and fragmented system for intimate partner violence victims. The team will be co-chaired by The Honorable Kim Berkeley Clark, President Judge of the Fifth Judicial District of Pennsylvania, and Erin Dalton, Director of the Department of Human Services (DHS). Fitzgerald and Gainey are serving as honorary co-chairs and conveners.<br>“I’ve said this often, but it’s no secret that our community does the best when we work together and tackling the issue of, and improving response to, intimate partner violence is no exception,” said Fitzgerald. “We are grateful to the many stakeholders coming together to give of their time and effort and are committed to making real changes to our system to connect everyone and improve outcomes for all of those who interact with our many systems because of that violence.”<br>Along with Fitzgerald, Gainey, Clark and Dalton, the leadership team includes Dr. Debra Bogen (Allegheny County Health Department), Hillary Brown (Nina Baldwin Fisher Foundation), Carlos Carter (Urban League), Cindy Chung (US Attorney for the Western District), Chris Connors (Fifth Judicial District of PA), Matt Dugan (Allegheny County Public Defender’s Office), Dr. Kathi Elliott (Gwen’s Girls), Chief Bruce Fromlak of West View Borough (Allegheny County Chiefs of Police Association),  Michelle Gibb (Alle-Kiski Area Hope Center), Tom McCaffrey (Fifth Judicial District of PA), Dr. Elizabeth Miller (UPMC), Nicole Molinaro (Women’s Center and Shelter), Angela Reynolds (YWCA), Deputy Chief Thomas Stangrecki (Pittsburgh Bureau of Police), Kristy Trautmann (FISA Foundation) and District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala, Jr.<br>“Thank you to the Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh and the FISA Foundation for their work and support of this new effort to address Intimate Partner Violence,” said Gainey. “This leadership team and their work to create real reforms and politics on this critical public health issue are key to building a region where everyone can feel safe.”<br>The county’s standing intimate partner violence (IPV) task force meets annually and includes tactical working groups. Stakeholders from all systems engaged in a comprehensive participatory assessment process by The Urban Institute to document community responses to IPV and identify opportunities to improve. The project was funded by FISA Foundation and Hillman Family Foundations and resulted in a public report: [Advancing a Coordinated Response to Intimate Partner Violence: A Systemwide Assessment from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/104380/advancing-a-coordinated-response-to-intimate-partner-violence_0.pdf). The top priority was a commitment from top leadership to help mobilize agencies, enable experts and turn recommendations into policies and practice. The IPV Reform Leadership Team fulfills that goal.<br>“FISA Foundation supported the two-year planning and assessment project led by The Urban Institute that applauded the strong leadership already in place in the courts, human services, law enforcement and victim services, and established consensus on areas for improvement,” said Kristy Trautmann, Executive Director of the FISA Foundation. “We’re delighted that the County Executive, Mayor, President Judge, Department of Human Services, and many other leaders have put a stake in the group to support continuing reform to help victims of domestic violence to be safer. Coordinated leadership is the only way to tackle complex problems and the launch of this task force is a big step forward in addressing domestic violence in Allegheny County.”<br>According to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, one in three women, and one in four men, will be victims of physical violence by an intimate partner. In Allegheny County, there are more than 80 9-1-1 calls for domestic violence every day. Though overall 9-1-1 calls decreased during COVID, calls for domestic violence increased. From 2016 to 2021, four (4) percent of female victims of homicide were killed in their own homes. More than 14,000 people reach out to a victim services organization for support related to IPV each year.<br>“Elevating the coordination of the work with survivors of intimate partner violence will, quite simply, save lives,” said Nicole Molinaro, President/CEO of Women’s Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh. “We are honored that the county, city, courts and human service leadership have partnered with the domestic violence programs in Allegheny County and the FISA Foundation to address domestic violence as a public health issue that affects our entire community.”<br>Survivors, perpetrators of violence and child witnesses are served in large numbers in our systems. In 2018, 16 percent of all cases filed in Pittsburgh Municipal Court were for IPV. That same year, 37 percent of child welfare cases that were opened had IPV indicated. In 2017, 75 percent of perpetrators in child deaths had a history of IPV as an aggressor or survivor. The District Attorney’s Domestic Violence Unit resolves between 650-950 cases per year. There are 700-1,000 people served in domestic violence shelters every year. Roughly 50 percent of them are children.<br>“The IPV Reform Leadership Task Force is intended to provide visible and prominent leadership for reform efforts while also adding public accountability to making progress. The effort also invites public awareness and attention to the issues,” said Clark. “The involvement of cross-system stakeholders will help coordinate implementation of priorities.”<br>DHS has dedicated a high-level advisor to the work on IPV reform. Additionally, the department will focus on data infrastructure, expand Battering Intervention Programming, leverage state and federal grants, and provide any needed administrative support for the IPV Task Force.<br>“Issues of intimate partner violence impact all of our work at DHS,” said Dalton. “We are pleased to provide infrastructure to help tackle this critical problem.”<br>The IPV Reform Leadership Task Force had its first organizational meeting this morning which focused on basic orientation and a discussion about the key problems and issues that the group wants to address through this process. The group will reconvene in the near future for its first working meeting to discuss action steps and set priorities for the work groups. Thereafter, the group will meet annually.<br>\# # #<br>Contact:<br>Amie M.

| Mayor Gainey Celebrates Pittsburgh's Progress as a Global Emerging Tech Ecosystem | **Mayor Gainey Celebrates Pittsburgh’s Progress as a Global Emerging Tech Ecosystem**<br>_Pittsburgh is highlighted in the world’s paramount report on enriching startup and economic growth, ranking as the #13 global Emerging Ecosystem overall_<br>**PITTSBURGH -** Pittsburgh is highlighted in the 2022 Global Startup Ecosystem Report (GSER) that was launched today at London Tech Week by Startup Genome. The GSER is the world’s most comprehensive research on startups and includes over 280 entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems, with over 3 million startups analyzed each year. Pittsburgh is ranked this year as the 13th global Emerging Ecosystem overall, up from the 23rd last year, indicating significant progress and promise in the Pittsburgh region. <br>“When it comes to launching a new tech startup Pittsburgh is open for business,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “We are proud to see our city jump 10 spots on the Global Startup Ecosystem Report, and are eager to dig in and do more work so we can continue to climb in the rankings. Tech isn’t the economy of tomorrow, it is the economy today, and by working together with our regional partners we can ensure that the tech ecosystem in Pittsburgh can create pathways towards prosperity for everyone in our city.” <br>The InnovatePGH Partnership, Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, and Innovation Works, in collaboration with the City of Pittsburgh, have worked in concert with Startup Genome to showcase Pittsburgh’s entrepreneurial ecosystem in the 2022 GSER. Key findings on the Pittsburgh region are listed below:<br>- Global ranking as the #13 Emerging Ecosystem overall, up from #23 last year. <br>- Top 20 Global Emerging Ecosystem, Top 25 North American Ecosystem, and #3 North American Emerging Ecosystem in Funding — measures innovation through early stage funding and investor’s activity  <br>- Top 25 Global Emerging Ecosystem, Top 30 North American Ecosystem, and #5 North American Emerging Ecosystem in Talent & Experience — measures long term trends over the most significant performance factors and the ability to generate and keep talent in the ecosystem          <br>- Top 20 Global Emerging Ecosystem, Top 25 North American Ecosystem, and Top 10 North American Emerging Ecosystem in Performance — measures the size and performance of an ecosystem based on the accumulated tech startup value created from exits and funding         <br>- Created $11.6b in Ecosystem Value from July 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021<br>- The Pittsburgh Innovation District, high-quality tech talent, and affordability are cited as reasons a startup should move to Pittsburgh  <br>- The Advanced Manufacturing & Robotics, Life Sciences, and Cleantech sectors are highlighted for their density of talent, support resources, and startup activity<br>Jake Loosararian, Founder and CEO at Gecko Robotics, a Pittsburgh-based startup, says, “Pittsburgh’s improvement as a startup ecosystem is important both in terms of reality and recognition. The recognition is dramatic, while the reality has been steady and continuous, not overnight - reflecting the region’s history of industrial leadership, ingenuity, and old-fashioned grit. It’s also important to highlight Pittsburgh as a leader in tech generally - we’re the robotics capital, but we’re also leaders in software, biotech and biomanufacturing, and consumer internet. For a fast-growing startup, Pittsburgh is a great place to be for the core reasons outlined by GSER: the concentration of tech talent, the intensive support for R&D, and our affordability and livability (which will only become more important with rising inflation, increased focus on quality of life, and the decline of traditional tech hubs). Pittsburgh offers venture investor innovation and growth, and value investor fundamentals and durability.” <br>The GSER was created in partnership with the Global Entrepreneurship Network, Dealroom and Crunchbase. The 2022 Edition provides insights and guidance to public and private leaders on how to foster thriving startup communities — the #1 engine of job creation and economic growth. <br>The full report is available here: [https://startupgenome.com/report/gser2022](https://startupgenome.com/report/gser2022)<br>**About InnovatePGH Partnership**<br>[InnovatePGH](https://innovatepgh.com/) is focused on accelerating Pittsburgh’s status as a global leader in the innovation economy through [programs and initiatives](https://innovatepgh.com/programs-initiatives) such as ASTRI, Avenu Workspaces, Pittsburgh Innovation District, the University Talent Alliance and MovePGH.

I am proud to be a contributing member to the fund that will allow this to move forward and I commend all of the partners that came together to make this happen.” <br>“The City of Pittsburgh is the heart of Allegheny County and the economic engine of Western Pennsylvania,” said State Senator Wayne Fontana. “The Downtown Pittsburgh Conversion Program is a bold and innovative idea to ensure that the City continues to drive economic prosperity, while ensuring equitable access to housing. I am most excited that all levels of government—the Mayor, County Executive, and state delegation to the General Assembly—working with the building owners and the Downtown Partnership have come together to act in the best interests of our constituents.” <br>“As the market has changed over the past few years, including changes to the office market, we must also adjust,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “The residential market in downtown and the surrounding areas remains strong and it only makes sense to transition to that need. This effort also invests in the continued vibrancy of downtown which is the heart of our region.”<br>“Our growing residential community is making Downtown a more vibrant and resilient neighborhood, supporting our retailers and restaurants while also activating some of our beautiful historic buildings,” said President and CEO of Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership Jeremy Waldrup. “We greatly appreciate the leadership of Mayor Gainey, County Executive Fitzgerald, Senator Costa, and Senator Fontana in securing funds for this pilot project and look forward to working with them to identify additional resources to support more housing opportunities in Downtown.”<br>_###_ | 1/7/2022 10:43:41 |

| The Oakland Plan Has Been Adopted by the City of Pittsburgh's Planning Commission | **The Oakland Plan Has Been Adopted by the City of Pittsburgh’s Planning Commission**<br>**PITTSBURGH** — The City of Pittsburgh’s Planning Commission has adopted the Oakland Plan with conditions following a two-year long community process. The Planning Commission also made a positive recommendation to City Council to approve the related zoning amendments that will establish three new base zoning districts and expand the Inclusionary Zoning Overlay District (IZ-O) into Oakland.<br>This neighborhood plan builds on nearly a decade of neighborhood planning efforts led by the City’s Department of City Planning (DCP) and touches on 40 topics centered around community, development, mobility, and infrastructure. Common themes throughout the plan include:<br>- Growing housing and job opportunities in Oakland. New housing is needed to meet a variety of undergraduate student and long-term resident demands. The employment base needs to grow to provide jobs that are available to everyone and coupled with workforce development efforts to create pathways to prosperity.<br>- Utilizing public and private investments in Oakland to increase livability through new and improved open spaces, expanded tree canopy, stormwater management systems, and community services and amenities.<br>- Reimagining mobility systems in Oakland to prioritize the comfort and safety of pedestrians, transit riders, and cyclists.<br>- Acknowledging and addressing inequities for Black residents as well as students in Oakland and creating a welcoming environment for the neighborhood’s growing immigrant and newcomer populations.<br>“The Oakland Plan and associated Zoning proposals will guide development and investment over the next 10 years,” said Deputy Director Andrew Dash. “The adoption of the plan represents a huge public investment in the future of Oakland and the zoning changes provide us with new tools to prioritize job creation, affordable housing, and livability.”<br>In addition to guiding development and investment, the plan will serve as the Oakland area component of the City’s Comprehensive Plan. It's also the first plan to follow the City’s Neighborhood Plan Guide. <br>To meet the conditions for approval, DCP will revisit the plan’s Vision Statement and strengthen it to reflect the diverse needs of the Oakland community. The conditions for the zoning amendments will be addressed with the proposal that is presented to City Council.<br>The plan is available for review on EngagePGH: [https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/oakland](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/oakland) | 8/7/2022 14:01:49 |

Off-duty police officers will be stationed at the various intersections around Allegheny Commons to monitor traffic movements during the initial implementation of two-way traffic. <br>Allegheny Circle consists of four streets (North, East, South, and West Commons) in the Allegheny Center neighborhood that functioned for years as a four-lane one-way ring road. Early phases of the project reduced the travel lanes from four to two and added a bidirectional cycle track on the inside of the circle with parking on the outside. The current phase of the project finishes the transformation of the circle from a vehicle-centric road to a neighborhood-scale, multi-modal, pedestrian-friendly street.<br>The $3.2M project converts the street to two-way operations for vehicles, with one lane of traffic in each direction. The cycle track has been upgraded, and bicycle facilities were extended to connect with existing bicycle facilities along Federal Street. The project includes upgrades to traffic signals, intersection modifications to improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists, upgraded curb ramps, new pavement markings and signage, and other miscellaneous construction.<br>During implementation, the public is asked to please be aware of officers and flaggers, and to adhere to changing traffic patterns for motorists, bicycles, and pedestrians.  <br>For more information about the project please see the [project fact sheet](https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/current-projects).

While these emergency declarations expedited the overall design and construction process, the accelerated timeline did not allow for robust community engagement.<br>To date, bridge aesthetics has been one of the top subjects and has received significant feedback from the public. The Office for Public Art (OPA), which will curate the civic design process, will help to improve community interaction in the public project space.<br>The first step is gathering comments from the community to determine what they would like to see and/or envision for art on the new bridge. Residents are encouraged to provide their feedback regarding artistic enhancements for the Fern Hollow Bridge Replacement Project and can do so [here](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=QSiOQSgB1U2bbEf8Wpob3qHKbJE0XX9Ot-PkmqsPSCJUMkY2OTREMlVGNVZHMkI2T0lWNjFPM1ZTOC4u).<br>The project team looks forward to collaborating with both Mr. Peña and Ms. Mincemoyer and is excited to see the results of their artistic creativity.<br>### | 25/7/2022 14:54:22 |

This first donation, completed in early August, is the culmination of multiple years of work by the Department of Innovation & Performance (I&P) to give back these devices to the community and avoid paying an e-waste recycler for proper disposal.<br>“Our department is laser-focused on ensuring innovation and technological excellence are at the forefront of Pittsburgh’s future,” said Heidi Norman, Director of the Department of Innovation and Performance. “This is but one aspect of the city’s commitment to close the digital divide and promote increased digital literacy in Pittsburgh. Our partnership will create opportunities outside of the city government to enable residents to learn how to use new technology and protect our environment by reusing these devices.”<br>[Computer Reach](https://www.computerreach.org/) is a Wilkinsburg-based organization focused on making technology available to people most in need through refurbished equipment, computer literacy, training, and support. Their vision is to create a computer-literate world where the benefits of technology are shared by all. In addition to refurbishing devices, Computer Reach works to end the digital divide with their Digital Literacy Classes, Digital navigator Program, and Computer Lotteries.<br>“A reused computer is so much more valuable than one that is just disposed of in a landfill,” said Dave Sevick, Executive Director of Computer Reach. “It is one less chip to be made, one less rare metal to mine, and one more opportunity for a person to get connected to the world.

The first class will train officers that have received basic police training elsewhere but who need to learn Pittsburgh policies and the culture of policing that our residents want. These recruits will be ready to serve the City of Pittsburgh in approximately 12-14 weeks from the start of their class. The second class is for brand new recruits and will begin in the spring of 2023. Completion of training for these officers takes approximately 11 months.<br>“Our public health-based approach to ending violence in our city does not replace, nor is it in conflict with, law enforcement, said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Creating safety for all requires a range of strategies, including the presence of people trained to confront life-threatening violence.  If we are going to be successful in implementing our plan for peace, it is critical for us to have a police force that reflects our city and our values. We believe that these new classes will help us begin to build out the right type of policing so that our city can become the safest and most welcoming city in America.”<br>“The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is grateful to Mayor Ed Gainey for authorizing an academy class which will ensure that the Bureau maintains the ability to hire officers who reflect our rigorous standards and commitment to the community. We also thank the current PBP members who have never wavered in their duties, in spite of working extra hours amid lower-than-budgeted staffing levels to maintain the safety and security of our City. By hiring additional personnel, the Bureau will be able to improve services and create additional opportunities for officers to more fully engage with the community,” said Acting Police Chief Thomas Stangrecki.<br>"Introducing new officers to the ranks of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will not only help ensure the safety of the City's residents and visitors, but also provide increased opportunities and time for our officers to engage more closely with the community during non-emergency situations," said Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt.<br>The Gainey administration is hopeful about the early data and progress being made with the Plan for Peace, and is fully committed to this bold vision of ending violence and making Pittsburgh a city that is safe for everyone.  <br>#### | 31/8/2022 19:00:14 |
| City of Pittsburgh to Reopen the Swindell Bridge on September 1 | **City of Pittsburgh to Reopen the Swindell Bridge on September 1**<br>**PITTSBURGH —** The City of Pittsburgh is announcing the reopening of the Swindell Bridge, located in the city’s North Side neighborhoods, to all traffic on Thursday afternoon, September 1. <br>The bridge was closed on July 1, after the City was notified of debris falling from the underside of the structure. Prior to the closing, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) had contractors working in the area to address maintenance repairs on the bridge. Those repairs consisted of some milling and paving with partial overlay to resurface the area and create better driving conditions for residents.<br>Pursuant to the closure of the bridge, an emergency inspection was performed on Saturday, July 2, which found that material from the resurfacing deck repairs was accumulating in the expansion joint drainage trough. The additional weight of the debris caused the trough to tear open and spill onto I-279 Northbound below.<br>Repairs to the bridge were then hampered due to supply chain issues, but initial work, including the maintenance milling and paving operations, are completed. Larger repairs are still slated for later this year and the full-bridge rehabilitation project is moving forward in the planning phase.<br>As part of the emergency inspection, an underbridge crane was used to evaluate the structural components and review any potential problems. No additional deterioration or damage was found that would affect the structural capacity of the bridge. Routine inspections will continue occurring on a six-month schedule.<br>### | 1/9/2022 09:16:02 |

| Comprehensive Municipal Trust Fund Adopts New Policy to Support Diverse Investment Managers | **Comprehensive Municipal Trust Fund Adopts New Policy to Support Diverse Investment Managers**<br>_Diverse managers with a local presence will be given additional consideration to encourage the development of historically underrepresented groups_<br>**PITTSBURGH**– Yesterday the City of Pittsburgh Comprehensive Municipal Trust Fund (CMPTF) board adopted a new policy, in an effort to encourage the development of historically underrepresented groups, to add a Minority, Women, and Disadvantaged Emerging Investment Managers Program in order to retain a diverse pool of investment managers. This move will help provide increased opportunities for MWDBE Managers and make us a national leader in municipal pension funds.<br>“Building thriving communities for everyone means creating new opportunities for communities that have for far too long been underserved,” said Mayor Gainey. “This Emerging Investment Managers Program will help historically underrepresented groups build portfolios with our pension fund and help create new pathways for prosperity for local diverse investment managers.”<br>Mayor Gainey requested the CMPTF form a subcommittee to research the possibility of creating the program at the May 5th board meeting. Subcommittee members Deputy Chief of Staff Felicity Williams, Mark DePasquale, and Rich Ruffolo presented the proposal at the September 1st board meeting and was adopted by unanimous vote. This is the first time in city history that such a program will exist.<br>Local diverse managers will be given an additional consideration in an effort to encourage and provide opportunities for local diverse investment managers. Qualified investment advisers must be owned by minority, women, persons with disabilities, or other historically underrepresented groups. They must also have an investment portfolio of at least $100,000,000.<br>The new program includes target ranges for percentage of the entire portfolio – with a floor of 5% and a max of 20% in some classes. This ambitious benchmark is critical for holding ourselves accountable for the success of this program.<br>The Board will instruct their investments consultant to proactively identify MWBDE investment managers to be included in the search process and presented to the Board or the appropriate Sub-Committee.  <br>_###_ | 2/9/2022 08:15:39 |
| Department of Public Works Environmental Services Bureau Announces Sixth Annual Garbage Olympics on September 17 | **Department of Public Works Environmental Services Bureau Announces Sixth Annual Garbage Olympics on September 17**<br>**PITTSBURGH —** The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works (DPW) is inviting Pittsburgh residents to go for [GOLD](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15402_Updated_GOLD_Plan_Report.pdf) with their neighbors in the Sixth Annual Garbage Olympics that takes place citywide on September 17.<br>The Garbage Olympics began in 2017 with 5 teams competing for an Oscar award for the most trash collected. But the annual competitive litter pickup event has grown exponentially since its start. Last year, more than 620 volunteers, spanning 46 neighborhood teams, were pitted against each other and collected in excess of 1,170 bags of trash, 375 automobile tires, 195 TVs, and 20+ bulk items.<br>“Each act of cleaning up litter isn't just a single, isolated action; it accomplishes dozens of things, every single time,” states the City’s Anti-Litter Specialist, Chris Mitchell. “That act raises pride in our community. It makes our community safer. It makes our community stronger. It makes the land and water around us cleaner and healthier. And it discourages further littering by keeping it clean in the first place.”<br>This year's competition looks to break all previous records with even more neighborhoods and more volunteers poised to join returning competitors. The cleanup event will take place from 9:00 a.m.-11:00 a.m. with DPW and the Clean Pittsburgh Commission providing bags, gloves, safety vests, and "nifty nabber" litter grabbers. DPW and the City’s E-waste recycling vendor, E-Loop, will retrieve all collected refuse on-site for proper disposal. <br>“The Garbage Olympics allows anyone to make an impact in their neighborhood. You can have a team of two or fifty, either way you know that you’re a part of a bigger goal with all Pittsburgh neighborhoods doing a trash collection together," says Renee Robinson, Garbage Olympics Co-Founder and Organizer.<br>Winning teams will be announced by María Montaño, Mayor Ed Gainey’s Press Secretary, at a closing ceremony beginning at 12:00 p.m. the same day at [Threadbare Cider House](https://threadbarecider.com/) in Spring Garden (1291 Spring Garden Ave., Pittsburgh, PA 15212).<br>Interested residents can either join their existing neighborhood team as a volunteer or register a new neighborhood team for others to join by going to [www.PGHGO.org](http://www.pghgo.org/).

Mayor Ed Gainey participated in a virtual signing ceremony with Mayor Thomas Westphal this morning, September 9, 2022, to celebrate this momentous occasion.<br>“I am proud to announce that today the City of Pittsburgh signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the City of Dortmund,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “This agreement empowers our two Cities and will help guide our exchanges and city-to-city cooperation. In April and May 2022, our cities hosted exchanges – thanks to a grant from the European Union’s International Urban Regional Cooperation program – which inspired this formal commitment to a continued partnership. Together we will continue to pursue cooperation on climate technologies, the economy, and a just transition for our post-industrial cities to ensure all our residents have opportunities to thrive. Thank you Mayor Westphal, the City of Pittsburgh looks forward to our partnership with the City of Dortmund.”<br>The MOU focuses on three primary areas of cooperation: climate technologies, the economy, and administration exchanges. As post-industrial cities working towards a just transition, this agreement will build more opportunities for our residents to thrive.<br>“Many municipal issues lend themselves to thinking outside the box and adopting solutions from other cities or working on them together,” said Mayor Thomas Westphal. “In the spirit of urban diplomacy, the networking of cities worldwide is a necessary way to constantly improve as a municipality, but also to be able to provide inspiration for other regions.”<br>The Sister Cities Association of Pittsburgh helped develop the partnership between Pittsburgh and Dortmund through exchanges and increased dialogue since 2018, The agreement takes effect immediately and will last until December 31, 2025, pending renewal.<br>![Screenshot of a Zoom Call between Dortmund and Pittsburgh](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/19117_Dortmund_MOU_Signing_-_FINAL.png)<br>_###_ | 9/9/2022 09:29:24 |
| City of Pittsburgh Launches New Budget Transparency Tool on City Website | **City of Pittsburgh Launches New Budget Transparency Tool on City Website**<br>_Web page will empower residents to learn more about Pittsburgh's priority based budget initiative_<br>**PITTSBURGH –** The Office of Management and Budget in conjunction with the Office of Mayor Ed Gainey launched today a new method for residents to learn about the City budget. This transformative, digital tool creates a space for data transparency and awareness for the City’s Priority Based Budgeting initiative. The budget is one of the most powerful tools for influencing change and this web page empowers residents to learn more about what our city’s priorities are by looking at how Pittsburgh plans to spend its money. When residents are empowered with information and tools like [this](http://budget.pittsburghpa.gov/), we can create a City where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.<br>“Pittsburgh’s Priority Based Budget initiative ensures the decisions we make in City government reflect the will of the people in our City,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “This new tool enables residents to understand the budget on a deeper level. By providing this information in an easily digestible way, we are creating a better Pittsburgh where every resident has access to the information they need to engage with city government in a meaningful way. I want to thank our partners – ResourceX, Delivery Associates-Digital, and Bloomberg Philanthropies – for their support on this project.”<br>Deputy Director of Budgeting, Patrick Cornell states, “Our goal is to be sure that people have a clear understanding of what we spend their taxes on, and what public value is generated.” Cornell continued, “Our hope is that sharing clear, timely, transparent data with the community can help us to co-design policies and programs to help engage residents in our public service efforts.”<br>This project was spearheaded by the Office of Management & Budget (OMB), in partnership with ResourceX, an organization specializing in priority-based budgeting, Delivery Associates-Digital, a leading public sector technology group, and supported by the Bloomberg Philanthropies American Cities Climate Challenge. The Budget hub link [here](https://budget.pittsburghpa.gov/) is designed for easy navigation and provides critical information with speed and simplicity. A key feature of the hub is the menu of interactive budget charts (“Explore the Budget”) with near-real-time data that help users understand the allocation of the City’s budget across different departments and the degree of alignment with the community’s priorities. All data is available to be exported in different formats.  <br>Through a combination of videos, animations, and data visualizations, the Budget Hub starts by providing a non-technical and easy-to-understand explanation of what the Priority-Based Budget is and how it works in practice. It also includes a News & Resources section with posts on recent events, guides, and presentations, including a list of frequently asked questions on the budget process. Most critically, the Budget Hub is intended to be an instrument to facilitate dialogue between the City government and Pittsburgh residents about the budget priorities.

HALL PUBLIC SAFETY CENTER RE-LAUNCHES PUBLIC-PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS CLOSED AT THE OUTSET OF THE PANDEMIC**<br>_Zone 1 Commander Introduces Zone 1 Cares Pilot_<br>**PITTSBURGH, PA** – The City of Pittsburgh, in collaboration with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Zone 1, Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP), The Buhl Foundation, and One Northside, invites residents and the media to the relaunch and open house of the Northview Heights Calvin M. Hall Public Safety Center on Wednesday, September 28, 2022 at 2:00 PM.<br>The Northview Heights (NVH) Public Safety Center first launched in 2018 and served as a model for relationship-based policing. Designed to improve community safety through a deliberate community-policing approach focused on proactive policing strategies and ongoing collaborative problem-solving between the public and law enforcement, the multi-use public safety center space serves as both a Zone 1 police substation and a community hub.<br>This open house event will provide the public with a glimpse inside the facility – where residents will have access to a full spectrum of programming and shared community space -- plus an opportunity to hear from City officials, community leaders, and Northview Height’s residents on their hopes for the relaunch of the Safety Center.<br>Zone 1 Police Commander Shawn Malloy will introduce his Zone 1 Cares initiative. Zone 1 Cares is an intentional effort to build relationships between Zone 1 police and residents of the Northside. The initiative will begin in the communities of Northview Heights and Allegheny Dwellings this fall with plans for a full-scale launch in spring 2023 across all 18 neighborhoods of the Northside.<br>“Zone 1 Cares is a way for officers to meet residents where they are. Officers will be visible within the community and working in partnership with residents to improve safety, improve resident relations, and rebuild trust,” Zone 1 Commander Shawn Malloy said. “We want residents to see us, get to know us, and work with us. To ensure safe and welcoming communities where all residents can thrive it will take all of us working together.”<br>The goal is to have all officers assigned to a designated Northside sector that encompasses three to four neighborhoods. Officers will attend their designated neighborhood community meetings and begin engaging residents on foot walking their assigned communities distributing door hangers with safety resources and a QR code connecting residents to the One Northside website with safety alerts, community events with officers, and important safety resources.  Zone 1 Cares is funded through One Northside, the Buhl Foundation’s placed-based grant-making strategy to improve the quality of life for residents of the Northside.<br>In 2014, the Buhl Foundation chose to focus its grant-making approach on Pittsburgh’s Northside. Through a series of surveys, public meetings, and face-to-face meetings with residents, Buhl and their partners asked the public how they would change and improve their neighborhoods. In doing so, they identified several common themes, which became the pillars of their One Northside Initiative: Place, Employment, Health, Education, and Safety.<br>“I am grateful to the Mayor’s Office, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Zone 1, and the City of Pittsburgh Housing Authority for coming together again to reopen the Public Safety Center and work to meet the needs of our Northview Heights neighbors,” said Buhl Foundation President Diana Bucco. “We are excited to relaunch the Safety Center as the first step in re-engaging Northside residents following the COVID-19 pandemic. The Northview Heights safety center model is evidence that residents and police can partner for safer, more livable communities.<br>Efforts have been underway in Northview Heights since November 2021 to re-engage residents, and onboard new officers following the safety center’s COVID shut down in March 2020. As a part of the relaunch, 13 NVH residents have volunteered to serve as building captains to help engage residents, share information and rebuild community-based programming.<br>**Community Day Scheduled for Sat., October 29 at 1:00 p.m.**<br>A resident-planned community day is scheduled for Saturday, October 29 from 1:00 to 4:00 PM. Residents can enjoy free food, meet with social service providers, access a coat drive, have their children participate in fun activities such as Trunk or Treat, balloon animals and face painting. During the community day, residents and officers will pay tribute to Calvin M. Hall, the Zone 1 Police Officer fatally shot while off duty in July 2019.<br>“The Northview Heights Public Safety Center is a physical manifestation of the City’s commitment to the right policing,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Building a safe city requires deep community partnerships that focus on providing person-centered supports as detailed in our Plan for Peace. The residents of Northview Heights, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Zone 1, City of Pittsburgh Housing Authority, and Buhl Foundation’s One Northside initiative have exemplified this type of partnership with the relaunch of the public safety center in one of our communities in need.”<br>The Safety Center was made possible through a substantial investment of Housing Authority dollars to create a state-of-the-art facility to focus on resident engagement and community safety. The Zone 1 officers working out of the safety center volunteered for this post and are committed to the tenants of relationship-based policing.<br>“We have seen first-hand the powerful change that can happen when residents and police work together to take a proactive community approach to safety, said Housing Authority Executive Director Caster D. Binion.  The Housing Authority welcomes the opportunity to continue to partner with the Buhl Foundation, One Northside, Bureau of Police Zone 1, and Mayor Gainey. We are excited to support Commander Malloy in launching his Zone 1 Cares initiative.<br>The Safety Center will result in tangible change, improve the quality of life for Northview Height’s residents, provide community-based programming, advance relations between police and the community, and make officers’ jobs safer and more rewarding as they focus on community outreach and connecting with people. This approach to police-community relationships is informed by both police officers’ and resident feedback through the One Northside Initiative and Pittsburgh’s Zone 1 Police. Officers and resident building captains recently completed a two-hour orientation to outline how they want to work together.<br>**SPEAKERS (In order of appearance):**<br>PBP Zone 1 Commander Shawn Malloy<br>The Buhl Foundation’s Diana Bucco<br>Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey<br>Housing Authority Executive Director Caster D.

| City, County Announce Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/19264_Allegheny_Logo_STACKED_no_always_inspiring.png)![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/19265_City_Logo.png_(2).png)<br>**City, County Announce Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition**<br>Coalition will create and implement a 5-year playbook to close the digital divide by 2027<br>**PITTSBURGH** –â€¯Today, City of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and County Executive Rich Fitzgerald announced the Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition (PDEC), a working group of anchor organizations already working to promote digital equity and smaller community groups with intimate knowledge of the community need. The coalition will produce and implement a 5-year plan to close the digital divide in the region by the end of 2027. <br>“Our community always does its best when we work together, collaboratively, bringing all of our resources together to solve challenges, and the digital divide is no exception,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “We are grateful to the many organizations which have answered this call and will work with us to ensure that we are able to increase broadband access, particularly in senior, Black and Brown communities.”<br>“Today is a great day for the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County; today we break down silos and commit to a partnership to end the digital divide in our region by 2027,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Our transformation to an EDs and Meds economy, one that drives technological advances in robotics and medical engineering, will not leave anyone behind. We will work together, united – with the City, County, our foundations, nonprofits, and the private sector – with one mission: to connect our entire city and close the digital divide.”<br>In 2015, the City of Pittsburgh published the [Roadmap for Inclusive Innovation](https://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/innovationroadmap/documents/Pittsburgh-Roadmap-for-Inclusive-Innovation.pdf) which was underwritten by several grants and led by the Hillman Foundation. The Roadmap resulted in opening communications and partnerships between city government, residents, and technology-oriented community groups along with sustained programs such as [PGHLab](https://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/pghlab/index.html), the [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](http://www.wprdc.org/), and participation in Bloomberg Philanthropies’ [What Works Cities](https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/) program. However, the local government has not engaged in sustained digital inclusion activities to directly close the digital divide for our residents. The increasing importance of online activities for residents during the pandemic now requires proactive leadership to close the digital divide across our region.<br>To address the gaps in digital skills, low-cost high-speed internet services, access to devices, and technical assistance, a coordinated effort led by County and City officials along with leaders from other anchor institutions will allow the Pittsburgh region to submit well-rounded applications for enough funding to make digital equity a reality in the years to come.<br>PDEC’s strategy to close the digital divide will focus on achieving: 1. Reliable, robust broadband internet for all residents at a price point they can afford; 2. Access to a computing device that meets the needs of the end-users; 3. Digital skills to safely and securely use the internet for resident needs; and 4. Accessible technical support when technology breaks.<br>The PDEC is comprised of the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pittsburgh Public Schools, Allegheny County Housing Authority, Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, Neighborhood Allies, Literacy Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the University of Pittsburgh, Meta Mesh Wireless Communities, the Greater Pittsburgh Digital Inclusion Alliance, Computer Reach, United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and A+ Schools.<br>Organizations involved in the Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition will come together every few weeks to build a detailed playbook for closing the digital divide in Pittsburgh in 5 years. The playbook will: 1. describe the history of the digital divide in Pittsburgh, including our unique challenges; 2. map the great work that has already been done by our local organizations, big and small; 3. outline actions that we must all take to ensure everyone has access to affordable internet service, user-relevant computers, and the skills to safely and securely use the internet; and 4. set the stage to apply for federal digital equity grant dollars to make the plan a reality.<br>The PDEC expects to publish its five-year plan in the 2nd quarter of 2023.<br>### | 27/9/2022 15:34:53 |

| Statement from Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey Regarding Police Presence During Funeral | **Statement from Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey Regarding Police Presence During Funeral**<br>**PITTSBURGH**— Mayor Ed Gainey released the following statement regarding Pittsburgh Bureau of Police presence during funeral:<br>“The community plays a vital role in our work to build peace in our city, and if we want to be successful then we must have strong police-community relationships. Part of being a strong community partner, and a good neighbor, means that we show up when we say we are going to do so. We can’t expect to win the trust of our communities if we don’t respond to the call. At this time we can’t speak to any potential disciplinary actions while the investigation is underway. But do know we will hold those accountable for their actions.”<br>### | 3/11/2022 16:12:29 |
| Pittsburgh Awarded Gateways For Growth Research Award | ![](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/19265_City_Logo.png_(2).png)![Gateways For Growth Logo](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/19683_G4G.png)<br>**Pittsburgh Awarded Gateways For Growth Research Award**<br>Pittsburgh _and 8 other local communities join a network of more than 70 localities across 35 states deploying economic research and multi-sector welcoming plans to forward inclusion and economic opportunity for all._<br>**PITTSBURGH** — Today, the American Immigration Council (the Council) and Welcoming America selected the City of Pittsburgh to receive a [**Gateways for Growth (G4G)**](https://gatewaysforgrowth.org/) Research Award as part of the fifth cohort of the initiative. Launched in 2016, G4G is a competitive opportunity for localities to receive research support, technical assistance, and/or matching grant funds from the Council and Welcoming America to improve immigrant inclusion in their communities.<br>“Pittsburgh’s new neighbors play a vital role in the success of our city,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “The Gateways for Growth (G4G) Research Award will allow us to maximize the support we can provide our immigrant and refugee communities and help us build a safe, welcoming, and thriving city for all who work, live, and visit Pittsburgh. As one of only nine localities across the U.S. selected for this award, the G4G Research grant will empower our Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (OIRA) to implement a data-driven approach to their work. I look forward to sharing the results with the public so we may further highlight the key role of immigrants and refugees in driving growth and economic opportunities.”<br>The Council and Welcoming America teams support G4G awardee communities in creating a local narrative, backed by data, on the imperative for building inclusive communities and, for those ready to take the next step, to build a community-wide plan for immigrant inclusion supported by multi-sector stakeholders. The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (OIRA), founded in 2022, has been working with key stakeholders to build an infrastructure for Pittsburgh’s new neighbors to thrive as reflected in the Welcoming Pittsburgh roadmap. By working with member organizations from Pittsburgh’s Welcoming Communities collaborative and key stakeholders in the City and County, OIRA works every day to create a more welcoming city for all.<br>Local communities across the country have long understood the positive effects of their growing local immigrant population. Newcomers help drive population growth, revitalize neighborhoods, spur innovation, and enrich communities with cultural diversity. Pittsburgh, as part of the G4G 2023 cohort, is thinking proactively about how to create an environment that sends a message of inclusion and social cohesion, maximizes the contributions of all residents, and gives community members the tools they need to thrive together.<br>“The precedent set by the Gateways for Growth (G4G) Research Award granted to the City of Pittsburgh, Office of the Mayor is encouraging,” **said Sabrina Saunders Mosby, President and CEO of Vibrant Pittsburgh.** “As more immigrants and refugees call Pittsburgh home, it is imperative that we have access to accurate data that shows their demographic and socioeconomic contributions to our region. This is an important step in our path towards being a more welcoming and vibrant City for all.”<br>“It is exciting to know The Gateways for Growth Challenge award will give the City of Pittsburgh a tool to research and learn more about our growing immigrant population, their needs, and to help them expand their growth possibilities.” **Brent G. Rondon, MPA, CGBP, Senior Management Consultant for International Trade, University of Pittsburgh SBDC**<br>“Pittsburgh is a city with a proud and strong immigrant history—and an exciting future as new people from around the world become part of our neighborhoods as homeowners, part of the innovation in technology, education, and business development in our city, and part of welcoming other newcomers as we continue to expand and diversify our community,” **said  Dana Gold, JFCS Chief Operating Officer (COO).** “JFCS is delighted, as a refugee resettlement agency and an organization that serves immigrant needs, to see this research award be granted to Mayor Gainey's administration.”<br>“We are delighted to see the Gateways for Growth Challenge expand to another set of localities that reflect the diversity of our nation,” **said Molly Hilligoss, Network Director at Welcoming America.** “With each cohort, there is an opportunity to support and connect local leaders making their communities more welcoming and resilient places where everyone, including immigrants, can prosper and belong.”<br>“The Gateways for Growth program helps communities quantify what many people already know – that immigrants play a key role in driving innovation and growth,” said **Mo Kantner, Director of State and Local Initiatives at the American Immigration Council**. “We’re excited to see the network continue to grow to nearly eighty communities, and look forward to supporting localities with data and technical assistance as they work to ensure that all residents are welcome and have pathways to success.”<br>This year’s awardees, alongside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, include:<br>- **Brockton**, Massachusetts<br>- **Fort Wayne**, Indiana<br>- **North Shore Region**, Massachusetts<br>- **Ottawa County**, Michigan<br>- **Portland** and **Southern Region**, Maine<br>- **Santa Clara County**, California<br>- **Santa Fe**, New Mexico<br>- **South Bend** and **Michiana Region**, Indiana<br>G4G awardees will receive a combination of:<br>- **_Customized quantitative research reports_** from the Council on the demographic and socioeconomic contributions immigrants make in their communities; and/or<br>- **_Tailored technical assistance_** from the Council and Welcoming America to support communities as they draft, execute, and communicate a multi-sector immigrant inclusion strategy; and in some cases<br>- **_Matching grant funds_** from the Council and Welcoming America which, combined with support from a local funder, are used to aid in a community’s strategic planning process.<br>Year-round, the Council and Welcoming America maintain an interactive map at [**GatewaysForGrowth.org**](http://gatewaysforgrowth.org/) that serves as a clearinghouse for the successes of all current and prior G4G awardees.<br>**_About the American Immigration Council_**<br>The American Immigration Council works to strengthen America by shaping how America thinks about and acts towards immigrants and immigration and by working toward a more fair and just immigration system that opens its doors to those in need of protection and unleashes the energy and skills that immigrants bring. The Council brings together problem solvers and employs four coordinated approaches to advance change—litigation, research, legislative and administrative advocacy, and communications. In January 2022, the Council and New American Economy merged to combine a broad suite of advocacy tools to better expand and protect the rights of immigrants, more fully ensure immigrants’ ability to succeed economically, and help make the communities they settle in more welcoming.

| Mayor Ed Gainey's 2023 Budget Address | **Mayor Ed Gainey's 2023 Budget Address**<br>_Mayor Ed Gainey's 2023 Budget Address, as prepared:_<br>Good morning and thank you City Council President Theresa Kail-Smith, Finance Chair Councilman Lavelle, and the entire city council.<br>Over the past 10 and a half months my administration has been working hard each and every day to serve the people.<br>We have made a commitment to a learning culture in every department and that we would do all we can to make our great city into the safest city in America, the most welcome city in America, and a city where everyone who lives here or works here can thrive.<br>I stand before you today to say that the City of Pittsburgh is resilient, strong, and ready to face the challenges ahead.<br>I know we can meet those challenges and rise above them because in our first year in office I have seen us do it time and time again.<br>This is the story of Pittsburgh – a city that has reinvented itself – a city of resilience, of overcoming the impossible.  A city filled with people who will pick each other up and care for one another in times of great need.<br>A city whose steel built our country, whose workers organized together to build an American middle class and now we are building the tech that is going to return America to the moon.<br>We might be a city of 90 different neighborhoods, but we are ONE city, ONE community, and together we can accomplish anything.<br>This budget we have prepared – is balanced, and invests in restoring core government services for our residents.<br>Our 5 year projections on these investments we make today are not just investments we can afford – but that they are investments that will keep us financially solvent well into the future.<br>We have begun the process of creating a new foundation that will benefit our city for generations to come. <br>We are thankful for the hard work of our predecessors who brought us out of Act 47 in order to return Pittsburgh to the Global city it once was.<br>When I entered office, I made a promise to keep transparency and engagement at the forefront of our Administration.  <br>I am proud to say that I believe this budget process has accomplished that commitment.<br>We are looking forward to continue our transparency work with our Department of Innovation and Performance to publish an annual data governance report for the city – with new open data sets so residents can see our metrics of success.<br>This year, the Office of Budget and Management – with help from the Neighborhood Services team and the Department of Innovation and Performance – hosted 10 public meetings, utilized an online survey and other digital tools to capture opinions and ideas for city projects from the public.<br>The information and feedback we obtained during this process was invaluable. These meetings informed the final budget you see before you today.<br>We had historic engagement in our budget process, including a 500% increase in the utilization of our online surveys through our EngagePGH platform.<br>Residents were clear in their priorities for our capital budget and this is the feedback we received:<br>Infrastructure was the number one priority. This was also reflected in the survey that was distributed with more than 400 requests for Complete Streets projects.<br>With the collapse of the Fern Hollow Bridge less than 30 days into entering office, my Administration learned firsthand the critical investment that was needed for our city’s infrastructure.<br>Residents also prioritized the environment, housing, physical mobility, and equity.<br>I’m proud to say that the budget before you reflects a significant investment in these areas.<br>Since the beginning of my term I have spent a lot of time listening to our residents, civic leaders, and city employees about how they see our city and our shared values.<br>I tasked my staff and my department directors to review their budgets and find ways to enhance our city’s safety that make us more welcoming and find investments to help our citizens thrive.<br>When we invest in rebuilding our city’s critical infrastructure, we are investing in making sure that our neighborhoods are safe.<br>We are proposing the creation of a new bridge maintenance unit to care for the bridges that we already have, as well as a new unit that will allow us to rapidly develop plans to rehabilitate our bridges or design new ones when we need them.  <br>We also engaged in a review of our city-owned bridges, the report of our Bridge Asset Management Program is being finalized this week and will be released to the public shortly after.<br>We know that climate change is having a growing impact on our city – the increase in heavier rainstorms is leading to more frequent landslides – and that is why we are investing in creating a new Walls and Slopes unit within the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure so we can be proactive in our work in keeping our neighbors safe.<br>Our Department of Mobility and Infrastructure has taken on the responsibility of keeping our citizens safe as they drive, walk, and bike to work and school each day.<br>Next year they plan to continue this great work with more traffic calming projects, more smart intersection designs, and making sure our bridges are maintained and cared for. <br>Our budget is both an investment in improving core city services and improving the efficiency of local government – and we firmly believe that this leads to a safer city for all of us.<br>We are investing an additional $4 million in staffing and equipment in the Department of Public works to dramatically increase our capacity to respond to snow storms, and overcome a backlog of maintenance of vacant lots and public spaces in the summer.<br>This year DPW has piloted neighborhood blight reduction techniques in underserved neighborhoods across our city.<br>This includes expanding litter can locations, utilizing data to better understand best litter collection strategies, and reconstructing sidewalks on city-owned lots.<br>As you all know Public Safety has been one of our most important issues we have taken on as an administration.<br>Since coming into office I have met with rank-and-file officers from every public safety zone in the city.<br>We are proud of the fact that we are moving forward with the expansion of our Reach Out on the Streets (ROOTS) program with the Office of Community Health and Safety and the Office of Violence Prevention to bring needed services and violence interventions into every public safety zone in the city.<br>Over the past several weeks we have been engaged in a robust community conversation around what values and qualities we want in our next chief of Police. Soon will engage in a local and national search to find the next leader of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.<br>And next year will mark the first new classes of police recruits Pittsburgh has seen in over two years – a critical step to helping us build out a police department that looks like our city.<br>I would like to thank the officers that shared with us their ideas for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. Your ideas helped inform our decision around changing the credit requirements for the academy.<br>We are investing in new swift water rescue equipment to be prepared for flooding events, and upgrading our 10-year-old self-contained breathing apparatus in order to protect the lives of our Fire, EMS, and other first responders who work in hazardous conditions.<br>Thank you to all of our first responders – I will never forget the day that Fern Hollow happened and how you created a human chain in order to care for those who were injured. Thank you for your dedicated service.<br>This budget reinforces our commitment to making Pittsburgh the safest city in America, and that means keeping the people who work for the city safe as well.<br>Earlier this year we launched a new pilot program to document in real time the safety concerns our frontline workers have – and working with them to provide real time solutions to critical safety incidents in order to keep them safe at work.<br>This new real time safety system program has been rolled out in DPW and is currently being implemented in Permits Licenses and Inspections.<br>We are allocating funding for a new investigator in the Office of Municipal Investigations who will be focused on building a safe and welcoming workplace for City employees by investigating allegations of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.<br>Celebrating the diversity of our great city is key to making sure that Pittsburgh is welcoming and open to business for everyone.<br>Removing barriers to those who wish to do business with city government is critical to making a thriving city.<br>To that end we are funding a new disparity study in order to update, refine, and expand the City’s goals for inclusion of MWBE venders in our City procurement practices.<br>This is the first time this is happening in over 20 years.<br>Our Office of Business Diversity has exceeded their yearly goals for their work.<br>In one session alone signed up 60 new diverse small businesses to do business with the City of Pittsburgh.<br>Creating these opportunities for our small diverse businesses means more jobs for our residents and new opportunities for the growth of our local economy.<br>If we want to create lasting change for our community than we need to start by ensuring that there is a seat at the table for communities who have been ignored for far too long to guide us in our priorities.<br>When we read the gender equity report we knew that we needed to do more to lift up Black women in Pittsburgh.<br>This is why we launched our Black Women’s Vision for Quality of Life Initiative. <br>This work is centered on the lived experiences, expertise, and the visions of Black women across the City of Pittsburgh. <br>We should not be making policy decisions that are about Black women, without having Black women at the table guiding us. <br>This work is about making long term equitable investments that improve the lives of all Black women in Pittsburgh – and not just a short term pot of money that would serve a small fraction of them. <br>We want this table of Black women leaders to work with us and hold us accountable as partners to create systemic change so every Black woman in our city can thrive.<br>I’m proud of the fact that I have put together the most diverse administration in the history of our great City – more voices from impacted communities means we are better able to serve all of Pittsburgh.<br>Equity is fundamental to being a welcoming city, and should be a core value for all 3300 plus city workers every day. It cannot be the role or work of one person or one office.<br>Bringing Government to the people is one of the priorities for our Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs – this year they have been bringing government to the people while training over 800 officers on cross cultural competency.<br>Having equitable access to open green spaces, parks, and recreation opportunities is one of the many ways to make our city more welcoming for everyone.  <br>We also need to do the work of caring for our Parks and we are making robust investments in obtaining the tools and resources to care for them while embarking on new projects for parks all across Pittsburgh.<br>Like many departments in our City the Parks and Recreation department is undergoing a transformation in order to best serve our city.<br>This reorganization into 4 program areas will help focus our work and bring efficiency to these critical city services.<br>It also means transferring the maintenance of our city pools to create one integrated aquatics team.<br>We are proposing a new position in our CitiParks department in order to provide new opportunities for organized sports for our children.<br>Giving our children access to new opportunities for organized sports and programs is a critical tool in our Plan for Peace.<br>We also recognize that our front-line CitiParks staff are an invaluable community asset and resource. We are investing in them by proposing increases to their salaries, as currently they are among the lowest paid members of our workforce.<br>A thriving Pittsburgh means creating new opportunities for people to have good-paying jobs, access to new pathways to prosperity, and affordable homes to live in.<br>We are also looking to propose a new bond in order to develop more affordable housing for people in our great city.<br>Access to fresh food in every neighborhood in Pittsburgh is a priority for our administration.<br>We are proposing $3 million in seed money to begin to address food insecurity so we can look for ways we can scale up our existing programs to serve more people.<br>When we invest in creating a strong workforce development pipeline that connects PPS students to jobs across every sector in our economy we invest in a stronger more robust Pittsburgh for businesses.<br>We are preparing the future leaders of our city with our new Pathways to Prosperity program with PPS and are requesting new funding for PPS students to have paid internships through our Prepare to Prosper initiative launched earlier this year.<br>We also launched a new Youth Civic Leadership Academy where Pittsburgh Public Schools students right now are learning about their local government, while earning college credits and earning a small stipend to further their financial empowerment education.<br>This work would not have been possible without the partnership with Pittsburgh Public Schools, The President of the Heinz History Museum Andrew Masich, Executive Director of Youth Enrichment Services – Dr. Dennis Jones, CEO of Partner4Work Rob Cherry, and President of CCAC Dr. Quinton Bullock.<br>Thank you for your commitment to our children.<br>I would also like to thank PPS Superintendent Wayne Walters, and CTE Executive Director Angela Mike – our renewed partnership with PPS will have a lasting impact for generations to come.  <br>We are also seeking new funding for additional talent recruiters to proactively seek out qualified candidates for City employment so all Pittsburghers have access to City jobs.<br>Our Human Resources and Civil Services department has been a critical partner in our work to rebuild our partnership with Pittsburgh Public Schools.<br>They have been working to identify areas where we can eliminate barriers to employment – such as no longer requiring a driver’s license to serve as a crossing guard.<br>Removing these barriers creates new ways for people who wish to serve the City of Pittsburgh can have the opportunity to do so.<br>In order to rebuild our city and create new opportunities for growth we must modernize our work in zoning and development to increase staff capacity and accelerate reviews in the Planning department. <br>We are also making key investments to fully implement the OneStop permitting program.<br>One of the foundational principles for my administration is to serve the people.<br>In order to improve core city services, response times, and save taxpayer dollars we are embarking on a reorganization of departments to maximize our ability to serve.<br>Our Office of Neighborhood Services within the Mayor’s Office will now be the new home of 311. By working together community engagement and resident services will be improved.<br>This small and mighty team has been on the front lines of serving our residents. They meet regularly with over 80 different community groups each month – and together have responded to thousands of questions from residents and resolving over 70% of resident concerns during the initial intake process.<br>This new merger with 311 means they will be working together with our Department of Innovation and Performance to update the way we route service requests in order to improve our work responding to constituent requests.<br>Our Office of Communications within the Mayor’s Office will now be the new home of City Channel, our print shop, and website teams.

Including a panel discussion with attendees.<br>WHEN:<br>Wednesday, November 16, 2022<br>10 AM to Noon<br>WHERE:<br>Schenley Park Ice Rink—Banquet Room<br>_###_<br>**PITTSBURGH** \- On Wednesday, November 16, 2022 the City of Pittsburgh and CitiParks, along with Mayor Ed Gainey and Dr. Karen Hall (former UNLV WBB, Athletic Administrator, ESPN3 Color Analyst, & Author) will celebrate TITLE IX at 50.  Join us for this panel discussion: _Keeping the Momentum, Where Do We Go Now._<br>The panel Discussion will include Donna Sanft – University of Pittsburgh, retired Athletic Administrator; JoAnne Klimovich Harrop – Reporter, Trib Total Media; and Monica Harrison – Carnegie Mellon University, Assistant Athletic Director for DEI/Head Softball Coach.<br>There is a lot to celebrate in the first 50 years of TITLE IX, and there is still a long way to go to ensure equity for women.<br>In 1972, the US Department of Education introduced TITLE IX to protect from discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities that received federal dollars.  This federal funding is dependent on institutions being compliant with TITLE IX.  This compliance is measured with a 3-prong test:  1) Proportionality—enrollment of males and females, 2) Program Expansion—to ensure equal opportunities for men and women, and 3) Accommodation of Athletic Interest—maxing out sports offerings for girls.<br>After TITLE IX went into effect on June 23, 1972, educational programs that received federal money had to demonstrate compliance with nondiscriminatory practices—and while the law was not created specifically to address inequality in athletics—coaches and athletes quickly realized its potential to create change in sports.<br>As we celebrate this 50 year milestone, it is important to remember the following about TITLE IX:<br>- It is not sports legislation, it is a US Department of Education Amendment<br>- We are getting closer to an equal playing field but we are not there yet<br>According to Dr. Hall, “After TITLE IX, the landmark law prohibiting sex-based discrimination, went into effect; it changed the lives of women, not just through sports, but in all aspects of life—socially, familially and politically.  It empowered an entirely new generation in the work force!”<br>Echoing these sentiments, Mayor Ed Gainey agrees, “Pittsburgh needs to be safe, welcoming and thriving for all, and that means creating opportunities for girls and women!  And while TITLE IX is not just about sports, youth sports provides opportunities in a plan for peace and violence interruption, and we must ensure these opportunities are there for all.”<br>Sports is a vehicle of empowerment, you learn authority and adversity, and it breeds confidence and TITLE IX empowers female athletes.  We have seen increased TV time for women’s sports, the birth of new professional leagues, and finally seeing women moving into jobs that were once only male focused.  There is more work to be done.<br>TITLE IX TRAILBLAZERS:  Those who moved the markers forward in the pre and early years of TITLE IX.<br>TITLE IX BENEFICIARIES:  Those who receive scholarships/recruitment for sports or academic programs that were previously not available.<br>TITLE IX NEXT GENERATION:  Today and tomorrows coaches, positions of leadership, players and scholars moving forward to continue to break equality boundaries.<br>TITLE IX and its 50th Anniversary is important and effects everyone, not just collegiate athletes.  We want attendees of our celebration to walk away, wanting to do more to ensure an equal playing field for all!<br>_###_ | 14/11/2022 16:01:19 |

I am thankful for the youth groups and sports teams that have already answered the call to become snow angels and I encourage everyone who can to join us by going to [pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels](https://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels/) or calling 311.” <br>Data from past years shows the number of neighbors in need of assistance far surpasses the number of volunteers who sign up in many areas of the city. This year, the City is working to develop new partnerships with community-based organizations, youth sports leagues, faith-based groups, and employers to close this gap in several communities. Those neighborhoods include: <br>- Beechview <br>- Brighton Heights <br>- Brookline <br>- Carrick <br>- East Liberty <br>- Elliott <br>- Greenfield <br>- Hill District <br>- Homewood <br>- Manchester <br>- Marshall-Shadeland <br>- Mount Washington <br>- Perry South <br>- Sheraden <br>- Stanton Heights <br>Along with fostering stronger community relationships and relieving some of the stress that comes from winter weather events, Snow Angels makes Pittsburgh’s sidewalks safer for those who are regularly outside during inclement weather – like postal carriers, firefighters, and police officers.  <br>The City of Pittsburgh is offering several incentives throughout the winter season for individuals and neighborhood groups who help recruit volunteers. Together with community partners, we can work to ensure that any neighbor who asks for a Snow Angel receives one.<br>Volunteers can learn more and sign up online at [pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels](https://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels/). Neighbors seeking services and volunteers can also register for the program by calling 311. Residents can contact the Snow Angels Program directly at 412-255-0846 or [snowangels@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:snowangels@pittsburghpa.gov).<br>### | 28/11/2022 12:29:59 |
| Department of City Planning to Introduce Legislative Changes to City's Public Art Code | **Department of City Planning to Introduce Legislative Changes to City’s Public Art Code**<br>**PITTSBURGH** — The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning, in partnership with the Office of the Mayor, has announced reforms to the City Code regarding the Art Commission and Percent for Art Program.<br>“These legislative changes provide us with an incredible opportunity to examine the right role of government in the public realm,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “They aim to improve the form and function of the Art Commission and lay the groundwork for improved public art and civic design review processes.” <br>The proposed changes include <br>- Art Commission Revision: The Art Commission will be separated into two committees that review public art and civic design, respectively. This allows for focused areas of expertise and provides a more specific review criteria for projects appearing before each committee <br>  <br>- Percent for Art Policy Revision: Expanding the locations and types of artworks realized with Percent for Art funding by creating a centralized budget line for the program rather than individual percent for art calculation within each project. This will provide more equitable, impactful and relevant public art in Pittsburgh. <br>  <br>“The City code governing Pittsburgh’s public art has not been comprehensively updated since 1977. We’re still using 20th century code to plan for a 21st century city. To create a more comprehensive vision for the public realm, we need to rationalize and modernize both the composition and scope of the Art Commission,” said Assistant Director of Public History, Art, and Design, Sarah Minnaert.  <br>The Art Commission was established in 1911 to Guide the City’s civic design and public art and currently reviews an average of 50 applications per year, 65 percent of which are civic design related. Later, in 1977, the City adopted the municipal Percent for Art program, which states at least one percent of municipal construction or renovation projects costing $50,000 or more shall be set aside for the inclusion of public art.  <br>In addition to these changes, the City is working to finalize a Public Art Trust Fund to collect contributions to the Public Art Performance Point program. Established in the Zoning Code in 2018, the performance point system allows developers to increase their density by incorporating community priorities into their projects such as affordable housing, public art, and energy efficient design. The fund will also be able to receive private charitable donations, matching funds from charitable entities, and transfers from the general fund, as budgeted.<br>The legislation has been submitted to City Council for review. If approved, the changes will take effect immediately, in time for the commission’s first meeting in 2023. A summary of the proposed legislative changes can be found [here](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/19934_SUMMARY_OF_CHANGES_ArtCommission.pdf) | 24/10/2022 13:47:06 |

| National Park Service Officially Recognizes City of Pittsburgh as American World War II Heritage City | **National Park Service Officially Recognizes City of Pittsburgh as American World War II Heritage City**<br>**PITTSBURGH**\- \- The National Park Service has officially recognized the City of Pittsburgh as an American World War II Heritage City. The Federal Designation recognizes the inexhaustible contributions of Pittsburghers who supplied steel, iron, coal, munitions and critical materials during the war. The WWII Heritage City program was established by Congress in 2019 to “recognize and ensure the continued preservation and importance of the history of the United States involvement in World War II.”<br>“Pittsburgh has a long and rich history of providing the materials and manpower to change the world,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “During World War II, Pittsburgh served as one of the nation’s crucial defense manufacturing centers. In the decades since local organizations and residents have preserved this critical legacy in museums, memorials, and local programing. Understanding and honoring our history is vital to building a better Pittsburgh, and a better world, for all of our children. I thank the National Park Service for recognizing the importance of Pittsburgh and bestowing this WWII Heritage City designation.”<br>While many Pittsburghers were deployed overseas – their civilian counterparts transformed and converted facilities shuttered during the Great Depression into round-the-clock operations. The federal government contributed over five hundred million dollars to factory expansions producing airplane blades, torpedoes, anti-craft guns, tanks, and food from canning facilities. Taking advantage of its location through rivers and an extensive railway system and the hub of the steel and iron industry – Pittsburgh exceeded the demands and challenges of the war.<br>Council President Theresa Kail-Smith congratulates and thanks the Records Management Division of City Council for their “dedication to preserving and archiving Pittsburgh history.” Nick Hartley, Manager of Records Management Division says, “It’s no secret that Pittsburgh had a major influence on the war effort, but this recognition is also a testament to the many local historians, curators and preservationists who work to share and preserve that legacy. They should be proud of their work.”<br>This designation was granted to the City after a committee of City Staff, local historians, and preservationist submitted a nomination narrative uplifting the importance of Pittsburgh during WWII in August 2021.<br>More information about American World War II Heritage City Program can be found at [https://www.nps.gov/subjects/worldwarii/americanheritagecity.htm](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/worldwarii/americanheritagecity.htm)<br>### | 31/10/2022 19:37:16 |

| City of Pittsburgh Announces Traffic Pattern Changes with Reopening of the Fern Hollow Bridge | **City of Pittsburgh Announces Traffic Pattern Changes with Reopening of the Fern Hollow Bridge**<br>**PITTSBURGH —** The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is working to make safer connections to and from the Fern Hollow bridge for all users. The reconstruction of the bridge by PennDOT presents an opportunity to calm traffic at several complex intersections, while improving connections for pedestrians and cyclists who rely on this vital route.<br>After extensive data collection, field visits, public meetings and stakeholder comments, DOMI will implement a number of safety improvements for the Forbes Avenue, South Dallas Avenue, Beechwood Boulevard and Beacon Street intersections.<br>Amongst the largest changes is South Dallas Avenue, between Forbes Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard, will become one-way for southbound traffic only. The “Stop Except Right Turn” sign on southbound South Dallas Avenue will be removed and a dedicated left-turn lane will be added to reduce motorist confusion. Additionally, a stop sign on Beechwood Boulevard eastbound at South Dallas Avenue will be added to allow southbound South Dallas Avenue to be a free-flowing movement.<br>Several additional changes include intersection improvements at Beechwood Boulevard and Beacon Street to increase safety; a reduced speed limit on Forbes Avenue from South Dallas Avenue to Braddock Avenue, consistent with other parts of the Forbes Avenue corridor; a pedestrian walking space on north Beechwood Boulevard that connects to the end of the existing Beechwood Boulevard sidewalk; and concrete jersey barriers to protect the proposed two-way cycle track from the Fern Hollow Bridge to Beechwood Boulevard.<br>Installation of the full project will occur in Spring 2023. However, interim operational changes will be implemented immediately, concurrent with the reopening of the Fern Hollow Bridge. These include:<br>- South Dallas Avenue between Forbes Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard will become one-way southbound. Traffic will not be permitted northbound.<br>- The existing ramp between Beechwood Boulevard and Forbes Avenue will close to vehicle traffic.<br>- The stop sign on Beechwood Boulevard eastbound will be added.<br>Additional information, including full details on project design and intersection improvements, can be viewed [here](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/complete-streets/s-dallas-ave-forbes-ave-beechwood-blvd-safe-connections).  <br>### | 6/11/2022 12:43:49 |

| CITY OF PITTSBURGH RELEASES COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON THE STATE OF CITY OWNED BRIDGES | **CITY OF PITTSBURGH RELEASES COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON THE STATE OF CITY OWNED BRIDGES**<br>**PITTSBURGH** – Today the City of Pittsburgh released the report of the Comprehensive Bridge Asset Management Program. This report is intended to provide an accurate report on the City’s bridges. This program was launched this spring after the unexpected collapse of the Fern Hollow Bridge on January 28th, 2022.  <br>“When Fern Hollow Bridge came down, I knew that we had work to do to understand the condition of our city owned bridges, to make needed repairs, and to instill confidence in our infrastructure,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “This report of the Bridge Asset Management Program is intended for everyone to understand the state of all 147 city owned bridges. I would like to thank the team from WSP who worked diligently to prepare this report for our city.”  <br>As part of the report, local engineering firm WSP and its team conducted 147 bridge inspection reviews. The specially assembled bridge inspection report review team consisted of 5 engineering firms that have been doing bridge inspection in Pennsylvania for many years and included 12 engineers, 10 of whom are Professional Engineers, an individual licensed by the State Registration Board for Professional Engineers, with an average of 24 years’ experience in bridge inspection and load rating. Where needed, the team also inspected bridges itself.  <br>The City has been proactive in its response to the findings, initiating and completing repairs on a rolling basis. The next phase of the project with WSP involves the development of a comprehensive asset management plan. In anticipation of this plan, Mayor Gainey’s budget funded additional personnel in DOMI’s bridge unit as well as a bridge cleaning and maintenance program. <br>“When we announced this program I made a promise to the people of Pittsburgh,” continued Mayor Ed Gainey. “I would not hesitate to close a bridge down if it was found to be unsafe. Safety of the people who live and work in our city is our number one priority and we will continue to do the work of keeping our roads and bridges safe for everyone.”  <br>The comprehensive Bridge Asset Management Report can be found online at [http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20007\_Report\_to\_Mayor\_Ed\_Gainey\_with\_Appendices.pdf](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20007_Report_to_Mayor_Ed_Gainey_with_Appendices.pdf)<br>### | 6/11/2022 16:07:21 |
| Regional Coalition Earns Recognition for Work to Close Equity Gaps in Technology | **Regional Coalition Earns Recognition for Work to Close Equity Gaps in Technology**<br>**PITTSBURGH -** The Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition (PDEC) has been named the **Tech Community Leader of the Year** by [Technical.ly Pittsburgh](https://technical.ly/startups/pittsburgh-winners-2022-technically-awards/).<br>PDEC is a coalition of anchor institutions, nonprofits, and civic and governmental leadership from throughout the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. It has a stated goal of developing a five-year plan to address digital inequities across four key metrics:<br>- Access to high-quality, affordable broadband;<br>- Access to technology;<br>- Internet skills, knowledge, and literacy;<br>- Accessible technical support.<br>The PDEC will deliver its recommendations for achieving these four strategic outcomes to City and County officials before June 2023. This date was selected as it coincides with the announcement of state awards by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). These awards will be dispersed to counties across Pennsylvania for use in developing broadband infrastructure and digital equity initiatives, including skills training and device access. The PDEC collaborative recommendations will weigh in on a broader formulation for how to allocate those funds state by state and how the PA Broadband Authority, in turn, releases them to individual counties across the Commonwealth.<br>“We are fortunate to have so many partners who have come together to work on the strategy to address the digital divide in our community. This work is critically important to ensure that all in our region have access to broadband and technology that will allow them to avail themselves of the opportunities that exist in the county and city,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “Thank you to Technical.ly Pittsburgh for recognizing this work by PDEC on a larger stage. We appreciate and acknowledge the importance of their work, but to have others validate and support that work is extremely rewarding.”<br>“For far too long we have known the truth about the digital divide – that our seniors and our Black and Brown children have been left out of the rapid shift toward an online, connected digital world,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Investments like the Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition, partnerships like this, build a thriving city not just for those with existing access, but for our neighbors most in need. Thank you to Technical.ly Pittsburgh for uplifting this important and vital work by the PDEC. The recognition as “Tech Community Leader of the Year” further validates the importance of ending the digital divide in our region.”<br>Heidi Norman, Director of Innovation & Performance for the City of Pittsburgh, and PDEC member, believes that the PDEC's work could stand as a model for other coalitions across the state. “We recognize that the issues surrounding lack of access to high-speed internet, or lack of a modern device in the home, or the skills to know how to use one is a fundamental barrier for people who want to participate in our digital age. But the problem is larger than any government organization can solve. Having a true coalition assembled, as we have here in Allegheny County, with nonprofits, the library systems, our great universities, and so many others, is how we can solve the vast problems that exist because of digital inequities.”<br>The NTIA plans to distribute state allocations from its $42.5 billion fund by June 2023. These federal funds are from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed by President Biden in November 2021. A core element of the bill is to ensure every American has access to reliable high-speed internet. | 6/11/2022 19:04:34 |

Pittsburgh will always remember him for his generosity and kind spirit. May his memory is a blessing for all of us.”<br>## **Franco Harris**<br>_Celebrating a Pittsburgh Champion On and Off the Field_<br>**WHEREAS,** Franco Harris was born in Fort Dix, New Jersey, to Cad and Gina Harris. He passed on Wednesday, December 21, 2022, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His family and scores of fans around the world will miss him dearly; and<br>**WHEREAS,** Franco Harris was known as a prolific player for the Penn State Nittany Lions, where the Pittsburgh Steelers selected him in the first round of the 1972 National Football League (NFL) Draft and the 13th overall pick; and<br>**WHEREAS,** Mr. Harris was a running back in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers and later the Seattle Seahawks. In his first season with the Steelers, he was named the league’s Rookie of the Year by The Sporting News and the United Press International; and<br>**WHEREAS,** He was popular with Pittsburgh’s Italian-American population; his fans dubbed themselves “Franco’s Italian Army,” wearing helmets with his number “32” on them; and<br>**WHEREAS,** Franco was the first African-American and the first Italian-American to be named a Super Bowl MVP. His Super Bowl career totals of 101 carries for 354 yards are records, and his four career rushing touchdowns are tied for the second most in Super Bowl history; and<br>**WHEREAS,** Franco Harris was a key player in what has become known as the Immaculate Reception, a pun used by the Pittsburgh sportscaster Myron Cope; and<br>**WHEREAS,** In that famous game, the Steelers trailed the Oakland Raiders 7-to-6 in the fourth quarter of the 1972 divisional playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium. With Raiders defenders in pursuit, Bradshaw scrambled in the pocket and sailed a pass to fullback John “Frenchy” Fuqua at the Raiders’ 35-yard line. The pass deflected off Oakland’s Jack Tatum just as he collided with Fuqua, sending the ball back toward the line of scrimmage. Steelers’ Rookie running back Franco Harris snatched the ball just before it hit the ground and raced downfield to score the game-winning touchdown, giving the Steelers their first-ever playoff victory; and<br>**WHEREAS,** Franco Harris’ legendary pursuits continued off the field as he became a true ambassador for the City of Pittsburgh; Franco always said yes to helping with local blood drives, back-to-school events, and youth sports leagues; and<br>**WHEREAS,** Franco Harris passed away days before the 50th Anniversary of the Immaculate Reception and today on December 24, 2022 the Pittsburgh Steelers will retire his Jersey, Number 32; and<br>**THEREFORE,** I, Ed Gainey, Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh, do hereby proclaim December 24, 2022, as **Franco Harris Day** in the City of Pittsburgh.

| City of Pittsburgh Comes Together to Serve Residents During Storm | **City of Pittsburgh Comes Together to Serve Residents During Storm**<br>_Department of Public Works, Department of Public Safety, CitiParks, and volunteers from across the city workforce stepped up to ‘be a good neighbor’_<br>**PITTSBURGH** — The City of Pittsburgh workforce mobilized December 22 – 26, 2022 to serve residents facing the loss of heat and power, clear and salt the streets, and preserve residents' safety. <br>“One of the most important principles of any government should be to serve the people,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Our city workforce met the moment when we needed more support for our residents by volunteering their time and services. CitiParks staff immediately mobilized to respond to power and heat outages by opening warming centers across the city. Public Works crews showed up for every shift and didn’t stop clearing and salting streets for a moment. Our Public Safety officials never missed a beat and made sure that we were putting the safety of our residents first and foremost throughout the snowstorm and cold snap. Pittsburgh owes these incredible public servants a debt of gratitude. On behalf of the entire city, Thank You!” <br>During the course of the Snow / Ice event, which lasted about 60 hours, 310 Department of Public Works employees in 155 trucks spread about 1,800 tons of salt to treat 1,200 miles of streets. An additional 180 personnel from CitiParks and the specialty divisions including the Department of Public Works (DOMI) addressed their assigned city steps, sidewalks, and bridge sidewalks. All nine Heavy Equipment Operators worked various shifts around the clock to load trucks with salt. Mechanics worked shifts at the Heavy Equipment shop to make repairs as needed, and our contractor, First Vehicle Services was staffed through Saturday for any emergency repairs to equipment. Foremen and Supervisors worked through the weekend. <br>“I would like to thank the Administration and the men and woman of Public works for their response to our latest snow/ice storm,” said Councilman Anthony Coghill, District 4. “They were well prepared! Well staffed! Communication was excellent on all levels! It is comforting to know Mayor Gainey hears our pleas and is treating snow removal like the public safety issue it truly is.” <br>The Pittsburgh Office of Emergency Management & Homeland Security (OEMHS) established a virtual emergency operations center (EOC) to coordinate operations and facilitate routine report-out briefings between Pittsburgh Police, Fire, EMS, DPW, the Mayor’s Office, Allegheny County Emergency Management, Allegheny County Human Services, the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP), Red Cross of Western PA, and Duquesne Light. This collective continuously tracked and addressed issues including overnight shelter staffing hours and capacity, utility coordination to identify critical infrastructure without power, tracking the weather with the National Weather Service, and more. In addition, the Pittsburgh Police, Fire and EMS bureaus responded to weather-related calls throughout the storm, including infrastructure needs and medical issues. <br>“I am extremely proud of our Senior Center Staff, who mobilized immediately on Friday morning to get warming centers open,” said Louann Horan, Assistant Director, CitiParks.  “It was a true team effort that carried on throughout the City as city staff members volunteered to extend warming center hours during the extreme cold temperatures.” <br>CitiParks opened warming centers in Brighton Heights, Greenfield, Homewood, Sheraden, and South Side to provide Pittsburghers with warm facilities to rest and recharge due to loss of heat and power. This was accomplished with over 30 volunteers from the city workforce stepping up to ‘be a good neighbor.’ OEMHS staff were among these volunteers and filled critical staffing gaps to ensure they could be open as long as possible. | 12/11/2022 16:42:04 |

The URA's community and economic development work can help to make the entrepreneurial journey less treacherous, provided we apply the same professional stamina, level of focus, and care entrepreneurs apply to their dreams every day,” Nemani-Stanger said.<br>“The Gainey Administration and the Board of Directors of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh have chosen an incredible candidate,” said Kyle Chintalapalli, URA Board Chair. “We are confident that Susheela's business acumen, inclusive leadership style, and care for our communities will facilitate the organization's mission with distinction as we work towards building a more equitable and just Pittsburgh. While we know other women have held the title of Interim and Acting Executive Director, this is the first time in the URA's history that a woman will hold this post on a permanent basis, and we could not be prouder.”<br>Susheela Nemani-Stanger is the first woman and first person of Indian descent to hold the Executive Director position in the URA’s 77-year history. | 4/12/2022 19:01:07 |

| CITY OF PITTSBURGH REVIEWING ALL TAX-EXEMPT PROPERTY OWNED BY CHARITIES | For Immediate Release<br>**CITY OF PITTSBURGH REVIEWING ALL TAX-EXEMPT PROPERTY OWNED BY CHARITIES**<br>**PITTSBURGH**– Today Mayor Ed Gainey issued an executive order directing the Finance and Law Departments to review the status of all tax-exempt property in the City of Pittsburgh owned by charities to ensure that the special tax-exempt status is appropriate under Pennsylvania law, and, if not, to act accordingly.<br>“In the City of Pittsburgh, 34% of the property is designated as tax-exempt, that is, the owners are not paying any property taxes.” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “The only properties that should not be subject to property taxes are those owned by purely public charities – places where people who are down on their luck get the services they need, mostly for free. For example, the new Second Avenue Commons homeless shelter is a huge help to our community, and it is clearly a purely public charity.”  <br>As part of the review, the Finance and Law Departments will systematically examine all of the tax-exempt properties owned by charities in the City.  For those properties that are not owned by institutions of purely public charity, the City will take appropriate legal action to address the tax-exempt status.  The Finance and Law Departments will be using the judicially approved standards under Pennsylvania law to guide their review.<br>“This review will not include any churches or religious institutions,” continued Mayor Gainey.  “This work will also not impact the charity’s tax-exempt status under federal law.  They may still qualify as a charity for federal income taxes, but have to meet Pennsylvania’s standards to avoid paying property taxes here in the City.  Additionally, if your favorite charity has to pay property taxes, it doesn’t change the fact that your donations to it will still give you a tax deduction on your taxes.”<br>The review will be systematic and designed to ensure on-going compliance with the legal standards for property tax exemptions.  Mayor Gainey has directed that the review be handled carefully, but has also directed that the City act as soon as it locates a property that it believes should not be tax-exempt.  To that end, the City is asking for help from the residents in identifying non-compliant charities.  If any resident has information that a nonprofit may not be acting as an institution of purely public charity, and it owns property in the City of Pittsburgh, please notify the Finance and Law Department at [report@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:report@pittsburghpa.gov).<br>“We are asking our residents to help us in this endeavor,” continued Mayor Ed Gainey. “You are in the neighborhoods and you know what is really going on in your communities.  If you think that a charity is getting out from paying taxes when they don’t deserve it, please let us know.”  <br>A signed copy of the Executive Order can be found at [http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20259\_Signed\_Executive\_Order\_Regarding\_Property\_Taxes.pdf](http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/20259_Signed_Executive_Order_Regarding_Property_Taxes.pdf)<br>### | 9/12/2022 14:00:17 |

The bridge will remain open to pedestrians and bicycles, as will the Junction Hollow Trail, which runs below the bridge.<br>“I made a pledge to the residents of Pittsburgh that I will not hesitate to close a bridge for the safety of our citizens,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Inspection results have come back that tell us this bridge needs repair work to be safe for traffic. It’s because of the safety systems that we have put in place over the last year that we can act immediately, and proactively, to close this bridge—preventing another Fern Hollow.”<br>Needed repairs to the bridge will be undertaken as soon as possible to re-open the bridge to vehicles. DOMI estimates these repairs will take no fewer than four months and are projected to cost between $1M and $2M. While the bridge remains closed, the detours are as follows:<br>- **For eastbound/outbound vehicles**: Boulevard of the Allies, right onto Bates Street, left onto Second Avenue, left onto Greenfield Avenue, left onto Ronald Street, right onto Alger Street, left onto Greenfield Bridge, to Greenfield Road, to Panther Hollow Road<br>- **For westbound/inbound vehicles**: Panther Hollow Road, to Greenfield Road, to Greenfield Bridge, right onto Alger Street, left onto Winterburn Street, right onto Greenfield Avenue, right onto Second Avenue, right onto Bates Street<br>Last year WSP Global was tasked with spearheading the Comprehensive Bridge Asset Management Program, in conjunction with DOMI. While previous inspections did not indicate a need for closure, based on the results of an updated structural analysis, the bridge needs to be closed until repairs can be made.<br>“I want to thank our staff at DOMI and the work of our Bridge Asset Management Team for their diligence in our routine bridge inspections and for improving the processes and systems that ensure we have bridges that are safer and more secure for everyone,” continued Mayor Gainey.<br>The bridge, which is a critical link on the Boulevard of the Allies and connects Squirrel Hill and Greenfield to Oakland and Downtown, is already slated for a full $48M rehabilitation, with design presently underway. In light of the current, preemptive closure, DOMI staff are looking into avenues for expediting the existing timeline of the project.<br>Individuals looking for additional information on the rehabilitation project can visit: [https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/charles-anderson-bridge](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/charles-anderson-bridge). | 17/12/2022 15:58:41 |
| Statement from Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey Regarding Charles Anderson Bridge | **Statement from Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey Regarding Charles Anderson Bridge**<br>**PITTSBURGH —** Mayor Ed Gainey released the following statement regarding the Charles Anderson Bridge<br>"The $6 million in the 2022 capital budget for the Charles Anderson Bridge was a projection by the previous administration as to when state and federal funding could become available for construction work on the Charles Anderson Bridge to potentially start. This was a projection and not an allocation. The City’s Capital Budget is only adopted for a single year. As the annual budgets over the next five years in the Capital Improvement Plan are adopted the phasing and amounts are refined as project statuses change.  There was never $6 million allocated for Charles Anderson Bridge for this year. Further major infrastructure projects are reliant on TIP (Transportation Improvement Program) approval and funding via the Southwestern PA Commission (TIP-200-Report-January-2023.pdf ( [spcregion.org](http://spcregion.org/)) ( [https://bit.ly/SPCTIP0123](https://bit.ly/SPCTIP0123))) \- which as of January 2023 has moved those projects into funding starting in 2027, with an estimated construction bid opening date of September 2025. We are in the process of trying to expedite that funding as we both repair the bridge and plan the full rehabilitation of the project. | 18/12/2022 17:19:09 |

| CitiParks Recruiting Lifeguards for the 2023 Outdoor Pool Season | ## **CitiParks Recruiting Lifeguards for the 2023 Outdoor Pool Season**<br>_Increased wages and partnership with Pittsburgh Public Schools aimed to help increase recruitment efforts_<br>PITTSBURGH – As winter continues to grip the Pittsburgh area, CitiParks is thinking warm thoughts as we start to gear up for Summer. This begins and ends with Lifeguard Recruitment. Recruiting, training and certifying lifeguards is paramount to a successful Outdoor Pool Season and happy Pittsburgh swimmers.<br>“I am proud of the work CitiParks is doing to continue to open pools safely each summer,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “CitiParks has been working directly with the Pittsburgh Public Schools CTE program to launch a lifeguard academy in order to provide new pathways for kids to have good summer jobs at our pools this summer.”<br>The CitiParks Aquatics Team recruits, trains and certifies Lifeguards for the City of Pittsburgh every year. Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the task of onboarding lifeguards has given us new challenges, with the biggest one still looming: Recruiting enough Lifeguards to open the City of Pittsburgh’s Outdoor Pools. In 2021 we were able to open 8, and in 2022 we saw 12 pools open. For 2023, we would like to open as many as possible, but this is dependent on how many lifeguards we are able to bring onboard.<br>“We continue to work hard to garner increased interest in becoming a CitiParks Lifeguard. Hourly pay rates have increased from last year and will range from $16.48 - $19.05 per hour, based on experience,” said Kathryn Vargas, Department of Parks and Recreation Director. Additionally, Citiparks teamed up with the PPS CTE program this fall to host a lifeguard academy at Westinghouse High School. This experience provided an opportunity for high school students involved in the health careers and Public Safety focused CTE program to learn to swim and learn about what it takes to become a lifeguard. Moving into the spring Citiparks is looking to provide additional opportunities for students to get in the water and train with support from our lifeguards.  <br>Lifeguards must be City of Pittsburgh residents, at least 16 years old by September 5, 2023 and willing to work at any CitiParks Outdoor Pool. For anyone who is thinking about becoming a CitiParks Lifeguard, whether a new candidate or a returning guard, you can “pre-apply” by visiting our [**2023 Lifeguard Job Interest Form**](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=F3n09QTJaEORINMnzxdVkcdrp7mqkcZGquf3MRnscp5UQUNKUTFQRzBSNkNSM1YwOE9KS1UzMzFOSC4u).

| City of Pittsburgh Launches a Citywide Composting Pilot to Reach Goal of Becoming Zero-Waste City | **City of Pittsburgh Launches a Citywide Composting Pilot to Reach Goal of Becoming Zero-Waste City**<br>_City Planning’s Sustainability and Resilience division is looking for 300 residents to participate in a pilot to test regional composting solutions for City residents_<br>PITTSBURGH – The Department of City Planning’s Sustainability and Resilience division is working with local and regional partners to launch a five-month composting pilot across the City that addresses its goal of becoming a zero-waste city. <br>“We want to empower residents to create positive change in their neighborhoods. We are excited to see how our communities can grow with ready access to composting resources,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. <br>In 2021, Pittsburgh was awarded a $90,000 grant through the USDA’s Community Compost and Food Waste Production Project, which provides federal funding to implement strategies for municipal compost and food waste production plans. This funding helped the City launch SoilMill PGH, a two-year pilot program to develop and test strategies for planning and implementing a citywide compost and food waste reduction plan, starting with City facilities and events. <br>The first year of the pilot focused on research to gain insight into the current food systems in Pittsburgh to design a pilot program that matches the City’s needs. To launch the second year, the Sustainability & Resilience division is seeking up to 300 residents to test a variety of residential composting solutions, such as at-home composting, and investigate convenient pick-up and drop-off locations for users. They will also be testing composting at the Homewood Healthy Active Living Center, Carrick Community Center, City Farmers’ Markets, Park Shelters, and more. <br>As part of the pilot, the City is seeking a part-time community coordinator to assist with composting projects. Interested residents can apply at [https://bit.ly/CompostingCommunityCoordinator](https://bit.ly/CompostingCommunityCoordinator)<br>“Pittsburgh is still experiencing some of the lasting ecological effects of the steel industry such as reduced air and soil quality,” said Principal Resilience Planner Aftyn Giles. “Composting is a great way to strengthen local soils with vital nutrients. By scaling our composting efforts citywide, we can begin to improve the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the local crops we eat.” <br>To accomplish the pilot, the City has partnered with Ecotone Renewables, a system designed to help rehabilitate Pittsburgh soil and reduce food waste by adding nutrients from repurposed food waste while reducing water and air pollution, through the PGH Lab program. PGH Lab is a six-month partnership program that connects local startups with local government to support innovative practices that are more efficient, transparent, sustainable, and inclusive.  <br>City residents interested in participating should fill out the pilot interest form on EngagePGH. While no previous experience is required, all participants must live [within City limits](https://gis.pittsburghpa.gov/addresslookup/?extent=-80.0153,40.4473,-80.0101,40.4491). Selected participants will be notified in March-April 2023 in advance of the launch in late spring. <br>Learn more about the composting pilot and how to get involved on EngagePGH [https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/soilmillpgh](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/soilmillpgh) | 17/3/2023 15:53:37 |

| Statement from Mayor Ed Gainey on the FOP Contract Budget Amendment | I would like to thank City Council for its Standing Committee vote to adjust the 2023 Operating Budget to support the newly-negotiated FOP Police Contract.

| Statement from Mayor Ed Gainey on the Jim Rogers Settlement | My heart is with Jim Rogers’s family, friends, and loved ones today. As we put his family’s lawsuit against the city behind us, the city continues to pray for the family over this unnecessary loss of life. <br>I took office in the wake of the incident that took Jim Rogers’ life, and the investigation and disciplinary proceedings revealed a number of concerns in our Bureau of Police. While the prosecution of police officers is not in the city’s power, creating a Bureau rooted in community norms and civil rights is. So, we got to work. <br>We reached a historic agreement with the FOP that will allow us to implement a disciplinary matrix that provides officers and the public with a clear understanding of what happens if an officer violates the law or breaks department policy and procedure. We’re finalizing our staffing study that will guide us in the right size and right role for our police bureau. <br>We launched our Plan for Peace that emphasizes focused deterrence, diversion, and real community policing. We’re seeking accountability, not just for those immediately implicated in police violence, but also for those in the chain of command who allow poor practices and violations of policy to persist. And, very soon, we’ll have a new chief of police to continue that accountability. <br>In addition to the monetary remedy of this settlement, we will also be reviewing our use of force policies with the family and other advocates. We are committed to changing policing in our city and working to rebuild community police relationships so that everyone in Pittsburgh feels safe. | 27/4/2023 17:48:24 |

Information to be posted at [https://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/pdec](https://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/pdec)<br>The PDEC has identified four key action areas as critical to developing practical guidelines that address the digital gap in the City of Pittsburgh and throughout Allegheny County. The four key action areas are:<br>- Robust Broadband Access at an Affordable Price<br>- Computing Devices that Meet Users’ Needs<br>- Training of Digital Skills and Literacy to Accomplish Users’ Goals<br>- Widely Available and Accessible Technical Support<br>In their final report, due this summer, PDEC will provide specific recommendations to address each of the four areas. Broader recommendations currently include:<br>- Make use of existing private industry and nonprofit relationships to fast-track public communications, extend program outreach, and increase infrastructure assets that help assess digital gaps, match resources with need, and allocate funding.<br>- Use existing resources such as the national nonprofit Education Superhighway’s free “Affordable Connectivity Program Certification” course to help build a local corps of Digital Navigators. This Digital Navigator Corps will help residents learn about and apply for existing federal benefits that can be applied toward personal devices and monthly internet costs.<br>- Develop public-private partnerships with area corporations, computer refurbishers, and social services organizations to create a “2nd Life” supply chain that can rehabilitate and repurpose gently used computers for use in households that lack devices.<br>- Incentivize the development of training and support programs within regional anchor institutions through a mix of federal and state funding packages, workforce development incentives, and space-sharing benefits.<br>Currently, each key action area has a committee group assigned to it. Committee members draw their ideas from sector experience, professional relationships with communities, and public service experience. Each committee is asked to listen and collect input from the public based on the belief that representing all voices is a necessary starting point for all digital equity work.<br>PDEC was announced in September 2022 by County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and City of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey. It is a working group of large and small organizations in Allegheny County that endeavor to promote digital equity using their intimate knowledge of the region's digital needs across a variety of communities.

_City announces new opportunities for residents to share their input for the 2024 Capital and Operating Budgets_

PITTSBURGH, PA – The Office of Management and Budget invites residents to share their input on the City of Pittsburgh’s 2024 Capital and Operating Budgets through in-person community meetings, virtual engagement, and online surveys. This year, residents will have the opportunity to provide input about their budget priorities prior to Department Directors creating their budget proposals, and the information shared will help inform Directors in the creation of their proposals.

“Budgets are moral documents that represent the values we hold as a city,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “The 2024 Budget engagement process will give our residents an opportunity to share their vision for our city’s future. It is critical for our success that everyone who calls Pittsburgh home use their voice to let us know their priorities for our city.”

The City will host four in-person community engagement meetings, and one virtual forum in order to gather input from residents on their priorities for the 2024 Budget. Residents are also encouraged to register for their preferred meeting and take the online survey available at: [2024 City of Pittsburgh Budgets \| Engage Pittsburgh (pittsburghpa.gov](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/2024-city-pittsburgh-budgets)). Dinner will be provided for all in-person budget engagement meetings.

| Mayor Gainey Announces Changes To Zoning Fees | **MAYOR GAINEY ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO ZONING FEES**<br>_Update to fee schedule includes cap of $40,000, ensures City covers costs_<br>**PITTSBURGH –** Today Mayor Ed Gainey and the Department of City Planning announced an update to the Department of City Planning Fee Schedule. The City of Pittsburgh updated the fee schedule for the 2023 Budget to make sure that the City can recoup the costs of running the department and invest in making the process better for residents and developers.<br>“This new fee schedule is more equitable and makes sure that the city is able to cover the basic costs of running the program,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “The previous fee schedule left the city with a $1.4 million shortfall and left us unable to meet the needs of our residents.”<br>The City made a conscious effort to keep the fees reasonable and clear, with a 0.1% fee of project value for residential development, and a 0.3% of project value for commercial development. This latest update sets a maximum cap of $40,000.<br>The “project value” is the cost of the labor and materials to complete the work scope of the project submitted to the Planning Department. The value should not include the work or costs associated with “sub-permits” such as electrical, mechanical, fire suppression, fire alarm work, survey, and construction drawing creation, or “finish work” such as cabinetry, countertops, tiling, etc.  The project value also does not include land acquisition or financing costs.  Forty percent of the application fee to zoning is due upfront so that if a project does not move forward for any reason, the City still recoups partial costs for the work performed to review and the applicant does not pay the full fee.  <br>Last year it cost the City of Pittsburgh over $3 million to run the Zoning and Development Review division, but only brought in $1.6 million in revenue. This shortfall meant the city was unable to afford to invest in improvements or cover the basic costs of running the department.<br>The adoption of every fee schedule is a public process, reviewed and approved by City Council. A public hearing regarding the new fee schedule was held in December 2022. City staff previously communicated the new fees to applicants and customers with member organizations such as the MBA and AIA as well as through the PLI newsletter.<br>The addition of a maximum cap came after a series of direct conversations between the administration, residents, developers, and stakeholders.<br>“Today’s action signals that the City of Pittsburgh is open for business. We appreciate Mayor Gainey’s leadership and the spirit of partnership he and his team have demonstrated in working with the business and development communities to reach a consensus on how to address a significant barrier to growth and investment. By providing developers and investors with greater certainty, the newly announced forty-thousand-dollar cap on zoning fees opens opportunity for catalytic investments, opportunities that would have otherwise been deterred. We look forward to continuing to work together across the public and private sectors to find innovative approaches to economic development and growth that move the City of Pittsburgh and the region forward.” <br>**_\- Matt Smith, Chief Growth Officer, Allegheny Conference on Community Development_**<br>“We thank Mayor Gainey and his team for the active engagement with our construction industry professionals and our industry partners to work toward this fee cap of $40,000. Listening and utilizing our industry expertise and resources to bring about this solution that we can all support illustrates collaborative leadership and sends a message that Mayor Gainey and the city value our owner, developer, institutional partners, and our contractors who work each day to build, maintain, restore, and improve our great city.”<br>**_\- Dave Daquelente, Executive Director, Master Builders’ Association of Western Pennsylvania_**<br>“A major concern of NAIOP’s is the risk of turning away investment opportunities for Pittsburgh and towards competitive markets where predevelopment budgets are not discouraging.  The Mayor and his staff welcomed our request to meet with NAIOP and community leaders regarding increased zoning fees.  He listened to our concerns and made positive changes to the fee structure with a $40,000 cap.   We view this as an excellent step in creating a regular and productive dialogue with the Mayor’s office regarding process improvement opportunities to generate economic growth throughout the City.”<br>**_\- Brandon Snyder, Vice President, Pittsburgh Market Leader, AI. Neyer and NAIOP Pittsburgh Board President_**<br>"This cap provides our development community with certainty that they will not have to pay more than $40,000 for any planning review in the city. This ultimately means our members can continue to do what they do best; invest in our city. We thank Mayor Gainey for keeping an open-door policy with us and for listening to our concerns regarding the zoning fee. We look forward to continuing to work with the Mayor to help craft future policies that can ignite increased investment in our city.”<br>**_\- Brandon Mendoza, Executive Director, NAIOP Pittsburgh_**<br>"Putting economic development projects together to revitalize Pittsburgh communities and neighborhoods is complex and, ultimately, involves risk.  The commercial real estate development community needs a clear and defined understanding of what the public costs are associated with that process so that we can make sound business decisions.  It was important that the Mayor and his team listened to the concerns that the coalition presented.  Together we were able to reach a consensus plan that helps ensure that Pittsburgh is still a place where we as developers can continue to invest in our City and help create good paying jobs.”<br>**_\- Shawn Fox, President RDC, Inc._** | 22/5/2023 14:55:40 |
| Mayor Gainey and City of Pittsburgh Hosted Groundbreaking Ceremony in Celebration of Upcoming Construction at Homewood Field | **Mayor Gainey and City of Pittsburgh Hosted Groundbreaking Ceremony in Celebration of Upcoming Construction at Homewood Field**<br>**PITTSBURGH —** Earlier today Mayor Ed Gainey and the City’s Department of Public Works hosted a ceremonial groundbreaking to celebrate the upcoming construction at Homewood Field. The event also highlighted an approaching Pre-bid and Matching Meeting and the city’s desire to maximize Minority- and Women-owned business (MWBE) participation on the project. <br>“Homewood Field is a beloved and heavily used resource by the community,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “The redesigned and soon-to-be constructed campus will give our kids a place to learn how to swim, develop team and sportsmanship skills, and our community a place to gather.” <br>The project is currently out to bid. As such, the city is actively soliciting contractors and working to increase MWBE involvement. Today’s event provided an opportunity for those interested in bidding on the project to get information and ask questions, while allowing them to meet and network with subcontractors that are interested in working with them on the project. The Pre-bid and Matching Meeting will happen on Wednesday, May 31, at 9:00 am. It will take place at Homewood Field: 540 N. Lang Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15208. <br>“It is vitally important to increase diversity in our business spaces and workforce, because we know it leads to greater innovation and allows minority- and women-owned businesses the opportunity to succeed in markets that they historically wouldn’t,” continued Mayor Gainey. “Diverse participation in this, and all city projects, creates a Pittsburgh where everyone can thrive.” <br>Once contractors are in place, construction is expected to begin in Summer 2023. The football field is being prioritized and is anticipated to be completed by Fall 2024, in time for football season. The remainder of the project is expected to be completed in Spring 2025. <br>In 2015, Homewood Community Sports (HCS), with the help of Heinz Endowments, Operation Better Block, Neighborhood Allies, Bridging the Gap Development, and The Mission Continues began a grassroots-level study of field improvements at Willie Stargell Field. The study identified some of the challenges that the site faces with the existing conditions. Namely, that the current field serves both as a baseball and football field, however, it is inadequately sized for both sports. <br>HCS led an extensive community engagement process in order to develop a Master Plan for the existing Stargell Field and expansion of Homewood Park onto the previous Homewood School property along Hamilton Avenue. <br>Based on the results of the Master Plan, the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Public Works, along with community partners and landscape architecture firm Studio Zewd undertook the re-design with the following improvements in mind: <br>Site engineering for the development of a regulation-size football field, seating and site-wide ADA accessibility<br>- A newly developed baseball/softball and flag football facility will be built at Faison Elementary School<br>- Structural engineering for retaining walls surrounding the site<br>- Relocation of existing pool and bathhouse/locker room to accommodate field renovations<br>- Site-wide stormwater management solutions, including cisterns or r-tanks under the athletic fields<br>- Connection to the Martin Luther King Jr. Busway and renovated pedestrian bridge to Westinghouse Park<br>- Cultural/performance space with connections to the Afro American Music Institute<br>- Playground and multi-purpose courts for various youth activities <br>The planned renovations will connect the neighborhood to other local amenities, while creating a space for the neighborhood’s youth to flourish. With an anticipated budget ranging between $12-$16 million, the project is partially made possible through generous grants from The Heinz Endowments and Pennsylvania Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP).  <br>### | 23/5/2023 08:21:43 |
| STATEMENT FROM MAYOR ED GAINEY ON SHOOTING OUTSIDE OF OLIVER ACADEMY | **STATEMENT FROM MAYOR ED GAINEY ON THE SHOOTING OUTSIDE OF OLIVER ACADEMY**<br>Pittsburgh, please join me in prayer for the family, friends, and the entire Oliver Citywide Academy community as they are once again mourning a young life taken by gunfire. I’m proud of the quick response by our Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, who were on the scene within minutes and were able to apprehend the suspect. Thank you for your continued work in making Pittsburgh safe.  <br>No child should ever have to fear going to school, and no parent should ever worry about their child never coming home. We are working with our Community Violence Intervention teams to provide help and support to students, and we will do all that we can to connect the family to support services.  <br>As a society, we have to reclaim our children, and we have to begin putting our children first. We have cultivated a culture of violence and death, celebrated guns, and glorified shooting. We have failed as a country to stop the proliferation of guns, and it is far too easy for a young person to get those guns and retaliate in the way our culture has glorified it. <br>Pittsburgh, we can and must do better. We have to cultivate a new culture, create a new path forward for our kids, and we are committed to investing in our kids to provide them with hope for a better tomorrow and a future that doesn’t end with bullets and gunfire.  <br>If you want to be a part of our work to end violence in our city, join us. Call us. We are willing to work with everyone who wants to be a part of the solution. | 24/5/2023 12:02:45 |

| Mayor Ed Gainey Addresses Juneteenth Celebration | **Mayor Ed Gainey Addresses Juneteenth Celebration**<br>_Mayor spoke_ _from his office about the financial commitments Pittsburgh makes to support the annual Juneteenth celebration_<br>**Pittsburgh** **—** Today Mayor Ed Gainey spoke directly to residents from his office in Grant Street to address concerns around the plans for this year's Juneteenth celebration.  <br>“I want to be clear the City of Pittsburgh was never going to cancel Juneteenth and never issued any directives around canceling Juneteenth,” said Mayor Gainey. “As an administration we committed ourselves to providing equal financial support to Juneteenth as we do to the 4th of July Celebrations, and our grant of $125,000 is a reflection of that commitment.” <br>During his address Mayor Gainey announced a commitment from the city of a $125,000 grant to help support the annual Juneteenth celebration in order to financially support the holiday to the same level as the July 4thfestivities. <br>Safety of all residents is important to us, and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will be patrolling this event as they’ve always have done. Our EMS crews and the Fire Department also will be on scene to ensure everyone is able to enjoy the celebration. <br>It is the responsibility of all private event promoters to comply with all regulations at events taking place in Point State Park, and these include the hiring of private security guards to screen bags ahead of any fireworks displays. <br>Mayor Gainey closed his address by noting: “Juneteenth is about our freedom, and its celebration should be equal to that of the founding of our country. This is a time to come together as a community to celebrate our freedom.” <br>**Full transcript of the Mayor’s Remarks below:**<br>Pittsburgh is at its best when everyone in our city feels safe and welcome, and where everyone has opportunities to thrive.   <br>As mayor, and as an administration, we have made major commitments to make sure that Juneteenth is treated with the upmost respect and dignity that it deserves.  <br>Last year we worked hard to make Juneteenth a successful event with the city providing nearly $200,000 of financial and in-kind support.   <br>Our administration also erased the debts owed by the private event promoter for previous years of Juneteenth celebrations.  <br>This year the City of Pittsburgh provided a $125,000 grant to support Juneteenth and will also provide nearly $80,000 of in-kind support through the work of our Department of Public Safety. <br>I want to be clear – the City of Pittsburgh was never going to cancel Juneteenth and never issued any directives around canceling Juneteenth.   <br>Our Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will be patrolling the event, our EMS crews will be on hand, as will our Fire Department, the city is prepared to do its part in keeping everyone safe as we celebrate this important national holiday.   <br>There are many major events and festivals that happen each year in our city, from Pride, to Picklesburgh, to Three Rivers Arts Festival and the Marathon.   <br>Each and every one of those events, which are all privately managed events just like Juneteenth, raises the funds needed every year to secure the permits, security, and other things needed to keep everyone safe.   <br>It is on the private event promoters to comply with all regulations associated with their events. For Juneteenth this means hiring security to screen bags at Point State Park in advance of the Firework display.  <br>This is a regulation that even the City of Pittsburgh must comply with for the annual 4th of July Celebration.  <br>There are only two events in Pittsburgh that receive direct financial support from the City of Pittsburgh: The Fourth of July and Juneteenth.  <br>As an administration we committed ourselves to providing equal financial support to Juneteenth as we do to the 4th of July Celebrations, and our grant of $125,000 is a reflection of that commitment.   <br>Yesterday, accusations were made that we are treating Juneteenth differently than every other event hosted in our great city.    <br>And the reality is, we do treat Juneteenth differently.    <br>No other privately managed event receives the amount of financial support that the city has given to Juneteenth this year, as well as the amount of in-kind support we have given to it in the previous years.    <br>Juneteenth is about our freedom – and its celebration should be equal to that of the founding of our country.    <br>This should be a time of coming together as a community to celebrate our freedom.<br>As a city we will continue to support the Juneteenth celebration and we hope that everyone has a good time.<br>### | 9/6/2023 16:23:45 |

Deputy Mayor Jake Pawlak met with the delegation from Saitama City including Mayor Hayato Shimizu and numerous members of Saitama city council. The proclamation was presented to Mayor Shimizu and Thursday was proclaimed “Saitama City Day in Pittsburgh”.<br>Pittsburgh and Saitama City have a long history of collaboration and exchanges.

| New law will make it easier for City to take control of privately-owned blighted properties | **New law will make it easier for City to take control of privately owned blighted-properties**<br>PITTSBURGH — The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an amendment to the Municipal Claims and Tax Lien Law (MCTLL) that will provide a critical tool for the City of Pittsburgh and its partners in remediating blight within our communities.  <br>“On behalf of my entire administration, I would like to thank the members of the Pennsylvania House and Senate who voted in favor of the legislation,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “We are especially grateful to Senator Wayne Fontana, who was the sponsor for SB 202, Senator Costa, Representative and Urban Redevelopment Authority board member, Sara Innamorato, and Representative Emily Kinkead, who sponsored HB 711, for their leadership and advocacy in getting us to this day.”<br>The amendment, known as Senate Bill 202 and House Bill 711, was approved in the Senate by a vote of 50 to 0 and in the House by a vote of 149 to 53.  Governor Josh Shapiro signed the bill into law on July 5, 2023, and it will take effect in 60 days.<br>The region has been actively advocating for the passage of this legislation for many years to remove barriers from the City’s ability to take public control of privately-owned blighted properties and return them to productive use. This will assist the City, as well as land banks throughout Allegheny County, remediate blighted property which positively impacts economic and social outcomes for our residents.<br>The bill’s passage follows a recent visit to Harrisburg by Mayor Ed Gainey and Chief of Staff Jake Wheatley to advocate for legislative and funding priorities on behalf of the City, including this piece of legislation.<br>Revitalizing Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods through equitable and transparent processes, that prevent displacement, is too often fraught with upfront costs and cumbersome processes. A frustrating reality, when we know that the results provide budgetary savings, a strengthened tax base, as well as socially and economically diverse communities.<br>The new law makes a few technical, process-related changes to Sheriff Sales in Allegheny County that will allow our region’s land banks, including the Pittsburgh Land Bank (PLB), to secure blighted, tax-delinquent properties more quickly and efficiently. These cost savings measures are critical to helping the PLB achieve community-driven reuses for these properties by making neighborhood-scale projects more economically viable. <br>Through the PLB and this improved land-recycling process, the City of Pittsburgh will be able to turn blighted properties across the city into affordable housing, urban agriculture, protected and maintained greenspaces, and increase development opportunities of all kinds for small, neighborhood-based, and minority and women-owned business enterprises.<br>This bill enjoyed support from a broad-based coalition that includes the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, Grounded Strategies, Allegheny County Economic Development, Tri-COG Land Bank, Pittsburgh Land Bank, Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, Housing Alliance of PA, and Pittsburgh Community Reinvestment Group. | 10/7/2023 16:03:16 |

| STATEMENT FROM MAYOR ED GAINEY ON THE RECENT GUN VIOLENCE | **STATEMENT FROM MAYOR ED GAINEY ON THE RECENT GUN VIOLENCE**<br>Pittsburgh, I ask that you join me in praying for all those who have been impacted by the recent gun violence in our city, which once again is leaving multiple lives forever changed due to the inability to settle personal conflicts peacefully.  <br>We are seeing time and time again that the mixture of easy access to a gun, and the inability to self-regulate emotional responses to conflict, is leading to more gun violence and senseless loss of life.  <br>The city and our dedicated Pittsburgh Bureau of Police can’t stop people from choosing this path. We had an abundance of officers in the South Side, and yet we weren’t able to stop people from choosing guns over peaceful resolution. This issue isn’t about the number of officers on our streets but about the number of guns in our city.  <br>We need to find ways to end arguments and conflict peacefully and we need our leaders in D.C. to repeal the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which prevents cities like Pittsburgh from holding gun manufacturers accountable for the harm their products cause every day.  <br>As a city we are committed to caring for all those who are harmed in the aftermath of these traumatic incidents. Last night we had social workers and CVI outreach teams on scene to help those who need it, and they are continuing their work in that community today and in the days ahead.  <br>Earlier today our Lifeguards, who acted quickly in executing their emergency safety plans, received trauma support to help them process through this tragedy, and we will continue to do what we can to support them and care for their psychological safety.  <br>Pittsburgh it is time to unite as one community to end this pandemic of gun violence. It is going to take all of us working together, to learn how to settle conflict peacefully, to provide resources and support services to all lives impacted by gun violence to heal these wounds caused by those who choose harm over life. | 13/7/2023 17:33:23 |

| Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, City of Pittsburgh, and US Department of Housing and Urban Development Announce Grant Award, Commencement of Bedford Dwellings Redevelopment | **Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, City of Pittsburgh, and US Department of Housing and Urban Development Announce Grant Award, Commencement of Bedford Dwellings Redevelopment**<br>PITTSBURGH — The Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) and the City of Pittsburgh are proud to announce they will receive a $50-million-dollar Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CNI) Grant, provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The historic grant award will be formally recognized during a check presentation ceremony open to the entire Bedford Dwellings community.   <br>The CNI funding award marks a significant step toward the transformation of Bedford Dwellings. The community holds the distinction of being the oldest occupied public housing community in Pennsylvania and in the City of Pittsburgh, comprised of 411 units. The community was one of seven New Deal Era public housing communities built in Pittsburgh between 1939 and 1944. <br>“We are extremely happy for the residents of Bedford Dwellings. They have been patient and engaged throughout the planning process and we’re at this point due to their persistent efforts. Additionally, there are a host of partner organizations that have dedicated significant resources toward preparing for this moment,” said Caster Binion, HACP Executive Director. “The time is now for Bedford Dwellings and the Greater Hill District community. This effort is going to produce generational change, serving as a catalyst for neighborhood revitalization.”<br>HUD’s Choice Neighborhood Initiative (CNI) plays a vital role in community transformation by revitalizing distressed public and assisted housing while also igniting essential improvements. Their primary objective is to facilitate the creation of favorable conditions that attract public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods by concentrating on the core focal points of Housing, Neighborhood, and People.<br>This involves providing amenities that residents desire, including spaces for youth activities after school, versatile indoor and outdoor areas for gatherings and special events, as well as the integration of small play and seating areas throughout the site. Enhancing the overall quality of life for the residents and making these neighborhoods more vibrant and attractive places to live.<br>HUD’s grant will serve as crucial assistance for the initiation of the redevelopment and enhancement process of Bedford Dwellings. Mayor Ed Gainey and Pittsburgh City Council have pledged $ 30 million dollars in city funds over time to ensure the positive outcome of the redevelopment. The entire investment for the transformation will amount to more than $ 400 million dollars over the next seven years with an anticipated completion by 2030. Additionally, the project is expected to generate more than 200 new employment opportunities, with the bulk of the jobs hopefully to be filled by residents of the surrounding neighborhoods. <br>“I’m thankful for the collaboration between the Housing Authority, community leaders, and residents in making the new Bedford Dwellings a reality,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “When you have a safe place to call home, you’re able to concentrate on other aspects of living and not just surviving. This goes to show how everyone working together can truly make Pittsburgh, America’s most livable city for all.”<br>The CNI Grant requires a one-for-one replacement of housing in order to avoid any potential displacement of existing residents. HACP’s plan for Bedford Dwellings, however, will produce a substantial increase in affordable units. In all, upon completion the site will have more than 800 units of new housing in the next seven years, consisting of 411 replacement units (Project Based Voucher, affordable housing), 210 additional affordable housing units, and 202 market-rate units for a grand total of 823 housing units. <br>Critical to HACP’s redevelopment plan is our new relocation strategy, known as “build first and move once.” Under this plan, residents will have several options, including choosing a replacement unit in the Choice Neighborhood, receiving a tenant protection voucher, relocating to another low-income housing community, and, where applicable, exploring homeownership opportunities. To ensure residents are well-informed, HACP will conduct meetings and consultations with them, as well as issue notices to clarify their rights throughout the process. <br>Other critical community improvements encompass various aspects to uplift the neighborhood, such as street-level activation initiatives to make public spaces more accessible, vibrant and engaging, encouraging pedestrian activity. Homeownership assistance will also be available, including acquisition and rehabilitation, and supporting residents in becoming homeowners, thereby promoting stability and investment in the community. These measures will create a positive and thriving environment, fostering a sustainable and inclusive community for its residents. <br>Residents of the impacted area will be provided with robust, onsite supportive services as part of the “People” pillar of the CNI Program. This component of the Bedford Dwellings/ Hill District CNI Program will be led by the Allegheny County Department of Human Services with support from Macedonia Face, the Community Enrichment Center, and the Neighborhood Resilience Project. This will ensure that residents are provided with supportive services for the duration of the redevelopment. <br>The transformation of Bedford Dwellings under the CNI grant involves a significant number of partnerships, each contributing to the success of the project. These key partners include:<br>- Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) - Lead Grantee<br>- City of Pittsburgh - Co-Grantee<br>- Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA)<br>- Allegheny County Department of Human Services (DHS)<br>- Allies & Ross Management and Development Corporation (ARMDC)<br>- Midpoint Group of Companies<br>- Trek Development Group<br>- Hill District Community Development Corporation<br>- Hill District Consensus Group<br>For additional information, please contact Michelle Sandige, HACP Chief Community Affairs Officer at [michelle.sandidge@hacp.org](mailto:michelle.sandidge@hacp.org "mailto:michelle.sandidge@hacp.org")  or Chuck Rohrer at [chuck.rohrer@hacp.org](mailto:chuck.rohrer@hacp.org "mailto:chuck.rohrer@hacp.org"). <br>**###** | 3/8/2023 16:35:42 |

So far in 2023, the City has seen a 24% decrease in homicides and a 13% decrease in non-fatal shootings.<br>“I’m proud of the work my administration is doing to make Pittsburgh the safest city in America,” continued Mayor Gainey. “While I am encouraged by the current trends, I know that we have much more work to do. I encourage everyone to learn more about this initiative and join an event near your community during our months of peace and nonviolence.”<br>#### | 3/8/2023 16:51:03 |

We are confident that our new approach will build stronger markets for all Pittsburghers to enjoy,” said Kathryn Vargas, CitiParks Director.<br>All 4 CitiParks Farmers Markets accept food stamps (SNAP), credit and debit cards as part of Just Harvest’s Fresh Access program.  SNAP shoppers can get fresh, nutritious, locally grown food, including produce, meat, dairy, bread and baked goods, plants, seeds, and honey.  (Hot prepared food items, alcohol, and non-food items are not eligible for SNAP purchases.)  Food Bucks give Fresh Access food stamp shoppers extra money to spend on fruits and veggies.  For every $5 spent in food stamps, receive an extra $2 to spend on produce.  For more information, visit [justhar](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjustharvest.org%2Ffresh-access&data=05%7C01%7Csusan.lucas%40pittsburghpa.gov%7C4306c7a6b9104a0162b808db4fdaed43%7Cf5f47917c90443689120d327cf175591%7C1%7C0%7C638191573958681706%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=rJYlBOThOvH%2B%2BZ31dWki%2FW%2Ff69deJxOoDJwmD3Tz2h8%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://justharvest.org/fresh-access.

One of the Data Justice for Pittsburgh’s Black Neighborhoods goals is to ensure that the Black community has a meaningful participatory role in the design of public data systems that will help redress environmental injustices.<br>“To ensure data are a force for good, we need to create data ecosystems-dynamic collections of information that center and uplift the needs of the most marginalized. We’re excited to partner with communities across the nation that have taken on this challenge,” said Jamila Porter, DrPH, MPH, principal investigator for MADE for Health Justice and chief of staff at the de Beaumont Foundation.<br>The city’s work with the BEC is expected to build meaningful community participation into the city’s data governance practices which will allow public agencies to be held accountable for their use of data and technology. The groundbreaking partnership will also provide data literacy training workshops to increase understanding about how power imbalances in data perpetuate structural racism and harm minority communities along with collectively identifying ways to improve data collected, shared, and used to improve environmental health outcomes.<br>“Equity is at the core of POISE Foundation’s philosophy. We are excited to partner with the City of Pittsburgh and BEC’s Data Working Group who are focused on developing practices that gather, analyze, design, and communicate information using an equity lens. We are equally excited to be part of this national cohort to both learn and share what we hope to be leading practices in the field,” said President and CEO of POISE Foundation Mark Lewis. | 17/8/2023 11:29:32 |

| PITTSBURGH ORGANIZATIONS AND THE CITY OF PITTSBURGH FORESTRY DIVISION TO RECEIVE A COMBINED $9 MILLION IN COMMUNITY FORESTRY FUNDING FROM FEDERAL INFLATION REDUCTION ACT | **PITTSBURGH ORGANIZATIONS AND THE CITY OF PITTSBURGH FORESTRY DIVISION TO RECEIVE A COMBINED $9 MILLION IN COMMUNITY FORESTRY FUNDING FROM FEDERAL INFLATION REDUCTION ACT**<br>PITTSBURGH – The City of Pittsburgh and its environmental non-profit partners know and understand the impact having green spaces and trees have on a neighborhood. Their hard work is being recognized through two Urban and Community Forestry Grants by the United States Department of Agriculture U.S. Forest Service.  <br>The Forest Service is making historic investments in boosting the nation’s tree cover in urban, suburban, and rural communities nationwide. The department selected 385 grant proposals from across the nation, two U.S. territories, three U.S. affiliated Pacific Islands, and several tribal communities working to increase equitable access to trees and green spaces, and the benefits they provide.   <br>The city’s vacant lots tree planting project designed to mitigate urban heat effects across City neighborhoods received a million dollars. This program focuses on underserved communities and works to identify and remove hazardous trees while also replacing them with new trees. In the end, creating or revitalizing natural areas in these neighborhoods.   <br>The Pittsburgh Canopy Alliance is receiving 8 million dollars to increase tree canopy and support a more resilient urban forest. This will help community-level planning and workforce development to plant and maintain trees along streets, in parks and public greenspaces, and on residential and institutional property within the Biden Administration Justice 40 zones.  <br>“These federally funded grants will make maintaining and creating green spaces for Pittsburgh residents easier. Due to climate change, we all can appreciate the shade of a healthy tree and the cool breezes they generate,” said Mayor Ed Gainey.  <br>Tree Pittsburgh led the Pittsburgh Canopy Alliance’s application, which includes Tree Pittsburgh, Western PA Conservancy, Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Landforce, Allegheny Land Trust, Allegheny County Conservation District, Goatscape, UrbanKind Institute, and Friends of the Riverfront. <br>With a net loss of 4,000 acres of tree canopy across Allegheny County between 2015-2020, the Pittsburgh Canopy Alliance has researched, prioritized, and developed shared goals to increase urban tree canopy with a focus on equity. The Alliance’s work supported by this funding program embraces community-level planning and workforce development to plant and maintain trees along streets, in parks and public greenspaces, and on residential and institutional property within Justice 40 zones. <br>Studies have shown that vibrant green spaces and trees help improve the overall health of residents, help reduce crime, and lower the average temperatures in communities.   <br>To view the full US Forest Service announcement, visit: [https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/urban-forests/ucf/2023-grant-funding](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/urban-forests/ucf/2023-grant-funding). <br>**###**<br>_**ABOUT THE PITTSBURGH CANOPY ALLIANCE**_<br>The Pittsburgh Canopy Alliance is a working group of more than 20 nonprofit organizations and government agencies across Allegheny County. Alliance partners are committed to increasing equitable access to urban tree canopy and the many human health, environmental, and economic benefits that it brings.

| STATEMENT FROM MAYOR ED GAINEY ON DISTRICT ATTORNEY ZAPPALA | **STATEMENT FROM MAYOR ED GAINEY ON DISTRICT ATTORNEY ZAPPALA**<br>**PITTSBURGH –** Over the past 18 months, the number one priority of my administration has been making Pittsburgh the safest city in America, and we are beginning to see early signs of our success. Right now, homicides are down 20% year over year, and non-fatal shootings are down 14%. Our goal is that we should have no losses of life in our city from gun violence, and we won’t stop working until that job is done.  <br>Contrary to reports, Downtown is rebounding after the pandemic. In July, tourism numbers surpassed pre-pandemic levels. So far this year 26 new businesses have opened and we anticipate another 12 opening soon. Cultural District attendance is over 80% of pre-pandemic levels. Our residential occupancy rate is over 90%. Not to mention the hundreds of thousands of people who enjoyed our summer festivals downtown, all without any major public safety incidents.  <br>Once again, the District Attorney is focusing on getting reelected, and not doing any real work in helping make Pittsburgh safe. Our officers have worked hard to bring him all the information he needs to make a determination in several high-profile cases, like the Air BnB shooting, and he has yet to do his job and charge those responsible. Our city also deserves to have an answer as to the outcome of the Jim Rogers investigation. We sincerely hope that the DA will put more effort in answering those hard questions, bringing those who make our City less safe to justice, instead of making unfounded and misinformed attacks about the Mayor, his administration, and our hardworking and dedicated Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  <br>**###** | 22/9/2023 17:03:46 |
| THE CITY OF PITTSBURGH DEER MANAGEMENT PILOT PROGRAM IN FRICK AND RIVERVIEW PARKS | **THE CITY OF PITTSBURGH DEER MANAGEMENT PILOT PROGRAM IN FRICK AND RIVERVIEW PARKS**<br>_Controlled White-Tailed Deer Hunt Begin Saturday, September 30_<br>**PITTSBURGH**– The City of Pittsburgh in partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture will begin the Deer Management Pilot Program on Saturday, September 30th. This is part of the Gainey administration's strategy to get a handle on the overpopulation of white-tailed deer in city parks.   <br>While deer are a normal part of the ecosystem, overpopulation can lead to a number of issues, including; agricultural and landscape damage, risk of diseases, deer-vehicle collisions, threats to natural resources and forests, and negative effects on the overall deer herd.   <br>City officials listened to the call for action from local residents and sought out the expertise of the United States Department of Agriculture to help find a solution to the problem.  <br>The USDA recommended that the city adopt an integrated approach to managing the white-tailed deer. Since, other options for management such as birth control, castration, and the transfer methods are not legal in the state of Pennsylvania.   <br>Allegheny County archers were invited to apply to participate in the pilot program. They were required to undergo a background check, wildlife violation check, and a rigorous archery proficiency test before gaining acceptance.  <br>They also face a zero-tolerance statute that will exclude them if they violate the rules. Thirty archers were selected randomly, and 30 additional archers were selected as backups. Per program requirements, they must take a doe first and donate the doe to a food bank program. On-site field dressing is not permitted.   <br>Controlled hunts will take place in designated areas of Riverview Park and Frick Park.  <br>Notice signs have been posted in both parks, letting park-goers know when archery hunting will take place.   <br>**Archery will happen in the parks on the following dates:**<br>Saturday, September 30 – Saturday, December 9;  <br>Tuesday, December 26 – Saturday, January 7; EXCLUDING SUNDAYS! <br>**For more information, please visit the Engage PGH website: https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/pittsburgh-deer-management-pilot-program.

| Single-Use Plastic Bag Ban to Take Effect in City of Pittsburgh This Month | **Single-Use Plastic Bag Ban to Take Effect in City of Pittsburgh This Month**<br>_The legislation goes into effect on October 14, 2023_<br>PITTSBURGH — Starting October 14, 2023, all retail establishments operating within the City of Pittsburgh will be prohibited from providing single-use plastic or non-recycled paper bags to customers at checkout or through delivery.<br>“We must continuously examine our practices to ensure we’re pushing Pittsburgh toward the promise of a better tomorrow, and an important part of that is working to ensure that our city processes are environmentally conscious,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “By enacting this ban on single-use plastic bags, we can reduce the amount of microplastics in our soil and water, decrease our city’s reliance on fossil fuels, and improve our recycling processes."<br>The legislation was originally introduced by City Councilwoman Erika Strassburger in November 2021, and later unanimously passed by City Council in April 2022. Under the new legislation:<br>- Retailers will be able to provide a consumer with a recycled paper bag for a fee of no less than 10 cents; the retailer will fully recoup the fee.  <br>- Shoppers who use cards or vouchers from either the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program or an EBT transfer card issued by DHS will be exempted from the 10-cent fee.  <br>- Limited types of plastic bags will still be available for individual purchase or under certain exceptions. These exemptions include: <br>  - Any bag used inside a retail establishment by a customer to deliver perishable items to the point-of-sale, such as:  <br>    - Bags used to package bulk fruit, vegetables, nuts, grains, or candy. <br>    - Bags used to contain or wrap meats or fish. <br>    - Bags used to contain unwrapped prepared foods, bakery goods, flowers, newspapers, dry cleaning, or similar items. <br>    - Bags used to package medications distributed through a pharmacy.<br>  - Bags sold in packaging containing multiple bags packaged together during manufacturing, such as: <br>    - Food storage bags (e.g. Ziplock) <br>    - Garbage bags <br>    - Pet waste bags<br>Local businesses may continue to use up their remaining stock of plastic bags without penalty through January 1, 2024, when strict enforcement of the legislation will begin.<br>“We want to ensure that this ban is not a burden on our small businesses across the city, so it’s important to us that they have a grace period to get into compliance,” said Tobias Raether, Environmental Enforcement Manager. “Also, I want to be clear that the city is here to be a partner in this transition. Our enforcement efforts will be focused on warnings and providing businesses with the resources and support they need to get into compliance.”<br>Americans use 100 billion plastic bags per year, which requires 12 million barrels of oil to manufacture. They take 500 years to decompose in a landfill, and often obstruct the City’s recycling machine.

That is exactly what the Diverse and Local Managers Program does and that is what led us to our decision.”<br>Under the leadership of Mayor Gainey, the CMPTF Board voted to establish a 3-person subcommittee to explore what needed to be done to update the Board’s Investment Policy to add a Diverse/MWBE Investment Manager policy. Mayor Gainey personally selected Deputy Chief of Staff Felicity Williams for the subcommittee. <br>“When you hear Mayor Gainey talk about creating a city where everyone can feel safe, be welcome, and thrive, this is the type of action that aligns with that vision,” said Felicity Williams, Deputy Chief of Staff. “I am committed to doing my part to ensure that qualified, diverse candidates get opportunities to help us carry out that vision.”  <br>Seeking to advance the efforts of the administration around diversifying the workforce of the City’s investment fund manager, Williams also introduced and advocated having existing investment managers complete a survey to determine the diversity within the firm’s personnel. The same subcommittee is currently reviewing the results of that survey to make recommendations on a process and path forward. The board has selected to make the review process for investment managers an annual process to ensure that diversity and inclusion standards are being met.<br>During the search for an S&P 500 Index Manager, the board received four (4) responses to this opportunity. Xponance Asset Management and Investment was one of 2 firms that met the qualifications of being diverse and having a strong, long-term track record in managing index funds. <br>Xponance Asset Management and Investment was selected, in large part, due to the board’s desire to prioritize firms with local ties and commitments. The firm is a majority woman and Black-owned firm out of Philadelphia, PA with ties to the Pittsburgh region<br>###<br>**ABOUT XPONANCE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT**<br>Xponance Asset Management and Investment is a multi-strategy investment firm whose primary goal is to be a trusted client solutions partner. Their name is derived from the word “exponent” and dually connotes our core objectives—to be a zealous champion for our clients, and to provide higher level engagement and a broader array of solutions to meet their investment needs. Xponance is owned by women and diverse professionals, whose common passion is to do the right thing for clients and each other. | 23/10/2023 12:25:56 |

| Statement from Mayor Ed Gainey on D.A. Zappala Efforts to Seize Control over Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Operations | **Statement from Mayor Ed Gainey on D.A. Zappala Efforts to Seize Control over Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Operations**<br>Since the day I was sworn in as Mayor of the great city of Pittsburgh, I have made clear that my number one priority is making this the safest city in America. Our public health-based approach to public safety combined with our efforts to improve community police relations has resulted in real tangible results.  <br>So far we have seen a reduction in homicides year over year. I’ve been clear to our officers, that if someone is causing harm in our city – be it those using guns to settle arguments or drug dealers preying on our most vulnerable residents, we want those individuals held accountable for their actions. <br>It is clear that Mr. Zappala is unable to stand on his 20-year career, and instead wishes to mislead and use fear to win an election. We have reviewed the case law, and if Mr. Zappala has a case or a statute that he can cite to prove he has the authority to seize control of our Pittsburgh Bureau of Police I’d love to see it.  <br>I can however say that time and time again our courts have stated that being homeless in and of itself is not a crime. He may wish to use his authority to punish those who have the least, but my administration believes in caring for their safety and working with our partners to provide credible offers of housing, security, and a path toward a safer tomorrow.  <br>We will continue our work to make our City the safest in America, and we believe in our mission of having zero gun deaths in Pittsburgh. In order to have the lasting peace that Pittsburgh deserves, we need real partners at the table who are ready to work together to make that a reality and not point fingers. | 30/10/2023 14:44:14 |

| Mayor Ed Gainey and Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su Host Signing Ceremony for Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principlesâ€¯ | **Mayor Ed Gainey and Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su Host Signing Ceremony for Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principlesâ€¯**<br>_Over 40 local businesses, labor unions, civic leaders, and community members publicly commit to participation in White House Workforce Hub in Pittsburgh_<br>**Pittsburgh** – Today, Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su, Mayor Ed Gainey along with more than forty partners consisting of unions, businesses, organizations, county and state leaders showed their commitment to Pittsburgh’s Good Jobs Principle. <br>“On behalf of the Department of Labor, I applaud each of today’s signatories of the Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principles, which will empower workers and help ensure equitable access to good jobs for people across the area, including communities that have been historically shut out -- like women and people of color. This administration is committed to growing our economy from the bottom up and the middle out – where no one gets left behind. That’s why President Biden chose Pittsburgh as one of five Workforce Hubs and has invested $255 million to Pittsburgh and Allegheny County so far,” said Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su. <br>“We know how important good paying jobs are to not only stabilize a community, a neighborhood, a city, a state, and the nation, they provide a pathway to a better tomorrow for workers and their families,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “We cannot do this alone, and none of this would be possible without our partners here today. I’m proud of everyone who has stepped up and signed onto these principles.” <br>The City was named one of five Workforce Hubs in May by the Biden-Harris Administration as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda that includes the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. All part of the historic private and public investments in creating good-paying jobs.â€¯ <br>This investment will enable workers to compete not just locally or nationally, but internationally in the worldwide, knowledge-based economy by preparing them and providing jobs that grows and supports the communities where they’re located. <br>“I’m proud to be part of the work that the Gainey and Biden-Harris Administration is doing to give everyone, young and old, who want to work the chance to get on the pathway to be part of the trade unions to help develop generational wealth,” said  Steve Mazza, Council Representative Greater PA Council of Carpenters. <br>This is a notable step to publicly endorse and commit to uphold the Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principles, a regional equity framework that advances good jobs for local residents across the Pittsburgh region, especially workers from disadvantaged populations, in order to build a safe, welcoming, and thriving community for all. <br>These Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principles include:  <br>- Priority recruitment, training, hiring, and retention of disadvantaged worker populations, including through partnerships with community-based organizations that have expertise and track records in serving disadvantaged workers;â€¯ <br>  <br>- Implementation of strategies that build equitable pathways for disadvantaged workers into good jobs and careers including: pre-apprenticeships programs with direct entry into registered apprenticeship programs, registered apprenticeship programs, apprenticeship utilization requirements, barrier-reduction strategies such as wrap-around supportive services, and training that promotes an inclusive and harassment/discrimination free workplace environment and culture. <br>  <br>- Tracking, measurement, and assessment of the progress in recruiting, training, hiring, retaining, and promoting disadvantaged workers through shared compliance, tracking, and reporting strategies and tools; <br>  <br>- Embedding the Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principles in procurement and contracting processes to the greatest extent permissible in law; and â€¯ <br>  <br>- Creation of an engagement and collaboration committee structure with inclusive and diverse membership, including representation of organizations that serve disadvantaged workers, to implement the Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principles, as well as jointly address and solve challenges; and  <br>  <br>- Utilization of project labor agreements (PLAs), community benefits agreements (CBAs), and other tools to codify and enforce these Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principles and agreements.â€¯â€¯ <br>  <br>Signatories to this pledge have also committed to joint implementation that operationalizes these Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principles and will begin working with the City Solicitor and Deputy Chief of Staff to build a Regional Equity Agreement to govern all projects within the geographic footprint of the hub, that are within the identified critical sectors, and that receive funding from President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda.  <br>In centering those vulnerable communities that have been historically left out of these opportunities, the administration has identified those who are disadvantaged workers as individuals who reside in an extreme need or high need community as designated by the Allegheny County Community Need Index and/or faces one of the following systemic barriers to employment: System involved/emancipated youth (14-30) or opportunity youth; returning citizens and individuals having a criminal record or other involvement with the criminal justice system; custodial single parents/households; and refugees and immigrants.  <br>Local businesses, unions and other organizations who desire to be part of the growth and collaborate with us can learn more at: [https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/white-house-workforce-talent-hub](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/white-house-workforce-talent-hub).  <br>Through the Workforce Hub workforce development board, Mayor Gainey, and Partner4Work; Pittsburgh is focused on creating pathways in four key sectors; infrastructure, advanced manufacturing (including robotics and bio manufacturing), high-speed internet, and clean energy as well as occupations that support these sectors such as cybersecurity.â€¯â€¯ <br>Currently a total of forty-one local businesses and organizations, seven unions, three elected officials and two authorities have committed to upholding the Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principles.

| 21st Annual Gingerbread Display and Competition Announces Official List of Winners, opens People’s Choice Award Voting | **21st Annual Gingerbread Display and Competition Announces Official List of Winners, opens People’s Choice Award Voting**

**PITTSBURGH —** The City of Pittsburgh’s 21st Annual Gingerbread Display and Competition, now officially opened for the holiday season, is pleased to announce this year’s winners.

After over 300 entries from schools, families, professionals, and neighbors were received for this year’s competition, a panel of judges selected their top choices. Unique creations were plentiful, while Pittsburgh landmarks, icons, and the year in pop culture were once again captured in the contest’s entries, including Acrisure Stadium, Barbie, and Taylor Swift.

In addition to the 19 category awards, this year included the inaugural selection for the Curator’s Choice, a pick from one of Carnegie Museum of Art’s own curators, and the Audacy Award, a special pick of local radio stations.

Rachel Delphia, Alan G., and Jane A. Lehman Curator of Decorative Arts and Design, selected Tom and Mary Wagner’s entry “Log Cabin” as the first ever Curator’s Choice. “This log home looks plucked right out of 19th century Pennsylvania landscape,” said Delphia. “With a chimney that would impress a mason, the details in this simple concept were beautifully executed.”

Audacy radio station staff were polled on their favorites, ultimately designating “The Woodland Whimsy House” from the Spegar family as the recipient of this year’s Audacy Award.

This year’s entries will remain on display through January 5, 2024, in the grand lobby of the historic City-County Building. Visitors are able to view the display on weekdays from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and on weekends from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Holiday closures will occur on November 23-24, December 24-25, 2023, and January 1, 2024. Those unable to attend in person can visit [www.pittsburghpa.gov/gingerbread](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/gingerbread) to view the online gallery, where voting is currently taking place for the 2023 People’s Choice Award, a chance for any viewer to vote for their favorite entry of the year. People’s Choice voting will conclude on December 31, with a winner to be announced shortly after the new year.

The Gingerbread House Display and Competition began in 2002 when Downtown Pittsburgh hotels hosted the event to benefit the Children’s Hospital Free Care Fund and since has attracted thousands of entries and visitors to PPG Place before moving to the City-County Building in 2019. The 2022 Gingerbread House Display and Competition is presented by the City of Pittsburgh Office of Special Events in media partnership with KDKA Radio, 100.7 Star, Y108, WAMO 107.3, and 93.7 The Fan.

| City of Pittsburgh Launches 2023-2024 Snow Angels Program, Mayor Ed Gainey Calls on Community to Assist Neighbors in Need | **City of Pittsburgh Launches 2023-2024 Snow Angels Program, Mayor Ed Gainey Calls on Community to Assist Neighbors in Need**<br>_The city’s Snow Angels Program provides Pittsburghers with Disabilities and Seniors with snow clearance._<br>**PITTSBURGH —** The City of Pittsburgh is excited to announce the official launch of the 2023-2024 Snow Angels program. The program pairs community volunteers with seniors and residents with disabilities who need assistance shoveling and salting their sidewalks and walkways throughout the winter.<br>“We frequently talk about how we make our city safe and welcoming, and the Snow Angels program is a vital service for our neighbors in need,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “As we launch the 2023-2024 Snow Angels season, I am calling on our residents to volunteer to become a Snow Angel to ensure that seniors and Pittsburghers with disabilities can continue to thrive during and after winter weather events.”<br>Data from past years shows the number of neighbors in need of assistance far surpasses the number of volunteers who sign up in many areas of the city. This year, the city is working to develop new partnerships with community-based organizations, youth sports leagues, faith-based groups, and employers to close this gap in several communities. Those neighborhoods include:<br>- Beechview<br>- Brighton Heights<br>- Brookline<br>- Elliott<br>- Greenfield<br>- Homewood (North, South, West)<br>- Hill District <br>The Mayor’s Office is excited to continue its tradition of honoring the neighborhood with the most volunteers with the Golden Shovel Award. Congratulations Bloomfield for being the Golden Shovel Awardee last winter!<br>The City of Pittsburgh is encouraging all residents to volunteer to help their neighbors in need. Along with fostering stronger community relationships and relieving some of the stress that comes from winter weather events, Snow Angels makes Pittsburgh’s sidewalks safer for those who are regularly outside during inclement weather – like postal carriers, firefighters, and police officers.<br>“Our city is full of generous people, and I am so thankful to the youth groups, sports teams, and community organizations that have already answered the call to become a Snow Angel. For those who have thought about volunteering, I encourage you to visit our website and sign up today. Your work as a snow angel is an important step in building a city for all,” Gainey continued.<br>Volunteers can learn more and sign up online at [pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels](https://pittsburghpa.gov/snowangels/). Neighbors seeking services and volunteers can also register for the program by calling 311. Residents can contact the Snow Angels Program directly at 412-255-2626 or [snowangels@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:snowangels@pittsburghpa.gov).<br>### | 21/11/2023 14:03:28 |

| Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition Release Community Strategic Plan | **PITTSBURGH DIGITAL EQUITY COALITION COMMUNITY STRATEGIC PLAN**<br>**Pittsburgh** – Today, City and County officials presented the Community Strategic Plan to close the digital divide in Allegheny County by 2030.<br>The plan was conceived by the Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition consisting of local City and County Departments, some local businesses and nonprofits who recognized the need to ensure everyone in the region have affordable access to the digital world.<br>Due to the pandemic, the City and County recognized the gaps within the communities and neighborhoods where many residents were badly affected by their inability or lack of having digital access.<br>“The COVID-19 pandemic showed all of us the importance of being able to connect in today’s digital world. For many, it was absolutely imperative for education, healthcare, employment, and more,” said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. “Ensuring adequate internet for all, particularly in those communities that are unserved and underserved with broadband, is of vital importance so that those who call this county home can continue to grow and thrive with equitable access to the many opportunities in this region.”<br>Along with County Executive Fitzgerald, Mayor Ed Gainey saw how important it was to close the great divide and how collaboration and partnerships can make it possible for all residents to thrive in the digital era.<br>“We know older residents, minorities, disabled individuals as well as those in the low-income bracket are falling through the cracks within the digital gap. We have identified the needs and have created a way to close that gap but, the plan will not work without collaboration and partnerships to implement it. We can’t become a truly thriving community without everyone succeeding,” said Mayor Ed Gainey.<br>One organization already implementing the plan is the United Way with their 2-1-1 Digital Navigator Network. This project is already working and is playing an integral part to make some of the plan’s key elements a reality.<br>It works by connecting residents to a Digital Navigator via their 24/7 helpline who can assist residents with signing-up for low-cost internet, access to a device, or digital literacy and skills training.  <br>“By working together, we can become the hub of a thriving and technologically advanced region where education, economic mobility, healthcare and quality of life are supported and promoted for all residents,” said Heidi Norman, Department of Innovation and Performance Director.<br>Closing the digital divide is an important goal that will focus on residents being able to have accessible and affordable broadhead, providing digital skills training and education along with getting residents affordable computing devices and technical support by 2030.<br>The Pittsburgh Digital Equity Coalition Community Strategic Plan can be seen via this link: [https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/23475\_PDEC\_Community\_Strategic\_Plan\_2024.pdf](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/23475_PDEC_Community_Strategic_Plan_2024.pdf "https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/23475_pdec_community_strategic_plan_2024.pdf") [.](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/23475_PDEC_Community_Strategic_Plan_2024.pdf)<br>**###** | 5/12/2023 17:10:22 |

It is also a time to recommit to closing the gap between the ideals set out by authors of the UDHR 75 years ago and the harsh realities that too many people in our community now face.<br>According to international law, having a place to live is a fundamental right, yet we are seeing an increase in people being denied this right. Today, a growing number of Pittsburgh residents face housing insecurity which leads to increased homelessness or residents being pushed out of the city due to rising housing costs.<br>The vibrancy and diversity of our city depend on efforts to ensure that all residents have access to housing and safe, stable communities. Pittsburgh advocates and elected officials are committed to protecting and fulfilling the right to housing for all Pittsburghers, and to remedying long-standing racial discrimination in housing policies. The Gainey Administration and City Council leaders have come together with advocates to create new mechanisms to defend and protect human rights for all residents of our city, and today we highlight several of these initiatives. <br>In response to growing needs, City leaders have put forward initiatives to ensure housing rights and freedom from discrimination, including additional protections for survivors of domestic violence and predatory real estate practices. The Office of Equal Protection aims to strengthen the enforcement of existing human rights protections and to make human rights central to City policy and planning. Enforcement of human rights policies is key to creating a true impact. <br>The right to housing and other basic needs are essential to making our city livable for all residents. Housing insecurity of any of our neighbors affects the character of our community and the future of the City upon which we all depend. Recognizing that Pittsburgh became the 5th U.S. Human Rights City in 2011, we come together to recommit ourselves to making human rights real in the lives of _all residents_ and to making Pittsburgh and the surrounding region a place where everyone can thrive. | 11/12/2023 12:11:41 |
| CLIMATE RESILIENCE MITIGATION PROJECTS | **CLIMATE RESILIENCE MITIGATION PROJECTS**<br>**LOCALLY CALLED THE MT. WASHINGTON LANDSLIDE REMEDIATION PROJECTS**<br>**Pittsburgh** – Today on Mt. Washington, Federal, state and local officials gathered to official celebrate the Climate Resilience Mitigation Projects locally called the Mt. Washington Landslide Remediation Projects. These projects were made possible through a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) $10-million-dollar grant extended through Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) which was then given to the City of Pittsburgh.<br>This project focuses on stabilizing parts of the Northern and Western slopes of Mt. Washington with retaining walls and geotechnical installations to protect homes and roadways. The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is leading the effort with the support of FEMA and PEMA to preemptively secure the hillsides of Mt. Washington to minimize the probability of landslides.<br>“Pittsburgh is no stranger to the impacts of landslides, said FEMA Region 3 Regional Administrator MaryAnn Tierney. We’re happy to support the actions the city is taking today to prevent landslides in the future. This project will not only protect residents, but critical infrastructure for many years to come.”<br>Recently, Mt. Washington has seen challenges on several locations where hillside instability has spilled debris onto roadways and walking paths. The three locations identified as areas that would best benefit from the remediation project are Greenleaf Street, Reese Street and William Street.<br>“The Mount Washington landslide remediation projects are excellent examples of what can be accomplished when municipal, state, and federal government officials work together on solutions that will provide benefits well into the future,” said PEMA Director Randy Padfield. “The success of these hazard reduction projects shows how strong partnerships lead to more resilient communities in the commonwealth.”<br>Reese Street, the first site that work will take place will shore up slope movement that would impact the Emerald Park Trail. Further mitigation solutions are needed to ensure long-term slope stability. Work on Greenleaf Street is necessary after a large landslide in 2018 showered Saw Mill Run Blvd with substantial debris heavily impacting traffic. While work on William Street is needed following several landslides that has already caused the closure of the road and a home being designated as uninhabitable by the project managers, FEMA and PEMA. While the City is monitoring the hillside will use this opportunity to develop further mitigations to stabilize the slope, reduce future impacts to additional homes and limit debris from falling on McArdle Roadway and Arlington Avenue.<br>“Through the assistance of FEMA and PEMA working with DOMI, we’re moving towards preventing a major tragedy from taking place. It’s also the leadership and hard work by the engineering design and contracting companies that will make this possible. I’m thankful federal and state officials were able to provide this grant to assist the City of Pittsburgh in keeping Pittsburgh residents safe,” said Mayor Ed Gainey.<br>Climate change is a threat to present as well as future development in our area but through the FEMA/PEMA grant, the City of Pittsburgh through DOMI will be able to ensure the safety of residents and develop means to mitigate erosions in our area.<br>Residents can reference the City’s Engage Website at: [https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/mount-washington-landslide-remediation](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/mount-washington-landslide-remediation) to see the full scope of the work.<br>**###** | 11/12/2023 15:02:19 |

I want to thank them for their work in helping to finalize a budget that continues to move forward our goals of making Pittsburgh the safest, most welcoming city in America, where everyone who lives and works can thrive.  <br>This budget is a reflection of our values as a city, and it includes historic investments into vital infrastructure improvements with a 300% increase in spending for bridge maintenance and repairs and a 136% increase in funding for traffic calming measures. It also includes an expansion of the sidewalk PILOT program and a commitment to continue the work on clearing vacant lots.  <br>Our budget continues long-term investments into restoring core constituent services, including adding 15 more staff to our Environmental Services team, which means more staff to pick up the garbage and plow our roads – all while helping to keep our workers safe from injury.  <br>This budget continues to build on our successes in Public Safety, with increased investments in the Office of Community Health and Safety, new vehicles for our Fire, EMS, and Police fleets, and the creation of 12 civilian Community Service Aides in the Bureau of Police to help make sure that our officers can focus on building stronger community-police relationships.  <br>These long-term investments into the future of our city are critical for our vision for Pittsburgh. I look forward to working with City Council in the new year on implementing this bold vision.   <br>**###** | 18/12/2023 14:30:53 |

Those neighborhoods include:<br>- Beechview<br>- Brighton Heights<br>- Brookline<br>- East Hills<br>- Elliott<br>- Greenfield<br>- Homewood (North, South, West)<br>- Hill District<br>- Lincoln Place <br>The Mayor’s Office is excited to continue its tradition of honoring the neighborhood with the most volunteers with the Golden Shovel Award. Congratulations Bloomfield for being the Golden Shovel Awardee last winter!<br>The City of Pittsburgh is encouraging all residents to volunteer to help their neighbors in need. Along with fostering stronger community relationships and relieving some of the stress that comes from winter weather events, Snow Angels makes Pittsburgh’s sidewalks safer for those who are regularly outside during inclement weather – like postal carriers, firefighters, and police officers.<br>“Our city is full of generous people, and I am so thankful to the youth groups, sports teams, and community organizations that have already answered the call to become a Snow Angel. For those who have thought about volunteering, I encourage you to visit our website and sign up today.

| The City of Pittsburgh's Office of Equal Protection to Strictly Enforce Paid Sick Days Act | **The City of Pittsburgh’s Office of Equal Protection to Strictly Enforce Paid Sick Days Act**<br>**The PSD Act ensures workers in the city receive paid sick time to prioritize their own health and the health of their families**<br>**Pittsburgh** – The City of Pittsburgh will begin strict enforcement and compliance checks for local businesses, to be sure they’re providing employees with paid sick days.  Enforced by the Office of Equal Protection, the Paid Sick Days Act ensures that almost all workers in the city are provided some paid sick time to care for the health of themselves and their families.   <br>Local businesses are required to establish a Paid Sick Days policy and provide notice of workers’ rights to their employees.  The Office of Equal Protections seeks to ensure that businesses will come into compliance with the ordinance, assisting workers to access the protections to which they are entitled.   <br>“The Mayor’s Office of Equal Protection is committed to ensuring that all workers in Pittsburgh receive paid sick leave, which is their right under law. As we emerge from a global pandemic, there is no more important time to protect public health. By enforcing the Paid Sick Days Act, we seek to ensure that our city is safe, welcoming, and thriving,” said Zeke Rediker, Executive Advisor on Legal Policy and Manager of the Mayor’s Office of Equal Protection.   <br>The Office of Equal Protection launched an educational campaign in September of 2023, where it provided notice of the rights and obligations of the ordinance to approximately 450 food service business owners and managers.  Beginning in early 2024, the office will conduct compliance investigations into food service businesses according to zip code, starting in 15201 and 15203.  Though the compliance campaign focuses on the food service industry, businesses in other industries are not exempt from the Paid Sick Leave Act and should be sure that they’re in compliance with the ordinance as well.   <br>Employees are asked to submit complaints on the Paid Sick Days Act website.  There they will find a form that can be submitted via the [website](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=F3n09QTJaEORINMnzxdVkYq01e5D_xFAkFmrTk39hIRUN1FGUFRaUUgyR0NUSUNYSERHODk0NjBERi4u) or [downloaded](https://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/file-a-complaint) and mailed in or dropped off to the Office of Equal Protection (414 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219). Retaliation and intimidation of any kind is strictly prohibited and includes, but is not limited to: <br>- Considering use of sick time in performance reviews or setting wages, disciplining or terminating <br>  <br>- Not allowing covered employees to use accrued sick time <br>  <br>- Reporting or threatening to report an employee or employee’s family member to law enforcement <br>  <br>- Discouraging or denying covered employees from using their accrued Sick Time <br>  <br>If retaliation is reported by an employee and proven, the Office of Equal Protection may seek full restitution to the employee for all lost wages and benefits reinstatement.  The ordinance is designed to keep workers from having to choose between paying bills and being present for work on days where they’re sick or having to care for a family member who is sick.   <br>Compliance investigations will be public information and can be viewed on the [Paid Sick Days Act website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/paidsickleave).  At the same time, the Office of Equal Protection will uplift hose that are striving to create a work environment that is conducive to the overall health and well-being of employees. <br>Businesses can fast-track compliance findings by sending a copy of their policy and a photo of their employee notice to [paidsickleave@pittsburghpa.gov](mailto:paidsickleave@pittsburghpa.gov) .  After investigations and review of submissions, businesses will be classified as Safe, Thriving, or Non-compliant.   <br>Employees and businesses interested in learning more about the Paid Sick Leave Act can visit:  [https://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/paidsickleave](https://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/paidsickleave)<br>**###**<br>**About the Office of Equal Protection**<br>The Office of Equal Protection is a civil enforcement and compliance office that seeks accountability in workers’ rights, civil rights, and public safety. The City of Pittsburgh and federal government have essential laws protecting the public health and welfare of Pittsburghers, including the Paid Sick Days Act, the Prevailing Wage ordinance, the Ensuring Equal Employment Opportunity for Persons Previously Convicted ordinance, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Disruptive Properties ordinance. These laws are designed to protect our communities, including the City’s most vulnerable citizens, from unfair labor practices, discrimination, and public nuisance. The Office of Equal Protection seeks to not only enforce these ordinances, but also educate Pittsburghers about their rights under law. | 3/1/2024 15:20:40 |

| Schenley Park Skating Rink Will Not Open for the 2023-24 Skating Season | **SCHENLEY PARK SKATING RINK WILL NOT OPEN FOR 2023-24 SKATING SEASON**<br>_Construction delays will prevent Schenley Rink from opening this winter_<br>**PITTSBURGH —** The Schenley Park Skating Rink has been a time-honored tradition since 1975 for City residents and visitors. Following the Rink renovation project from 2019, the Department of Public Works started to install a new chiller system in late Spring/early Summer 2023. As is often the case with major mechanical upgrades and renovations, there have been several setbacks that have delayed the project:<br>- While working on the site for the chiller installation a broken pipe was discovered requiring the sump pump to be replaced. The broken pipe and original sump pump backed up water into the trench where the original condenser piping existed, which slowed demolition.<br>- An exhaust fan required a lead time twice as long as originally expected, which delayed the installation of the new piping.<br>- Ammonia system installation and ventilation: this is especially important as safety is always the main priority. This installation is very delicate and must be installed to exact specifications. Some of the parts here are custom-crafted for each specific chiller installation to ensure proper fit and workability to site size and that has also added additional time to this project.<br>Delays from these items have caused a ripple effect throughout the project and ultimately finishing the chiller installation. The City hoped for its typical opening in November, then pushed that back to the end of January 2024. As things stand with an updated project timeline the installation of the new chiller system at the Rink should be completed in April 2024 (almost a full year after the project initially began).<br>“While we know this is disappointing, we want to let Pittsburgh know that the high quality of work being done and the steps being taken to ensure this project is done in the safest manner so we can continue to provide skating for years to come,” said CitiParks Director Kathryn Vargas.<br>While the Rink may not be opening this year, CitiParks will still host two annual skating traditions with a little twist:<br>Mascot Skate will become Mascot Madness. This annual event will take place at the Schenley Rink facility as a meet and greet and will include Mascots to take pictures with, games & prizes, face painting, balloon artist, caricatures, ice sculpture, and more!<br>- Saturday, February 10, 2024<br>- 1 to 3 PM<br>- Admission: $3.00 for Kids, $5.00 for Adults, $4.00 for Seniors & Veterans<br>- Tickets will be available online beginning Tuesday, January 16, 2024.<br>Valentines on Ice from CitiParks Office of Special Events will take place at the Hunt Armory. The evening will include chocolates, raffles, roses and more.<br>- Wednesday, February 14, 2024<br>- 8 to 10 PM<br>- Hunt Armory  (324 Emerson Street, Pittsburgh<br>- Ticket details will be available soon.<br>As the Department of Public Works completes the chiller installation in Spring 2024, Schenley Ice Rink will be back and better than ever when we open for the 2024-25 Skating Season — celebrating 50 years in January 2025! | 8/1/2024 12:34:58 |

| The City of Pittsburgh's Westinghouse Park Selected as One of 19 Nature Everywhere Communities | **The City of Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Park Selected as One of 19 Nature Everywhere Communities**<br>_This national initiative aims to increase equitable access to nature_<br>**PITTSBURGH** — The City of Pittsburgh, in partnership with the Outdoor Inclusion Coalition, Westinghouse Academy, Homewood Children’s Village, and Operation Better Block, has been selected as one of 19 U.S. Nature Everywhere Communities by The Children & Nature Network, the National League of Cities, and KABOOM!.<br>The Nature Everywhere Initiative aims to increase equitable access to a healthy, natural world by working to reduce disparities in housing, employment, food, health, and education. Nature Everywhere Communities will receive two years of strategic planning, technical support, and start-up funding to develop and implement community-driven plans for connecting children and families to nature-based experiences and learning.<br>“One of the main pillars of my administration’s vision for the city is creating an environment where people can ‘thrive’, which means making sure that ALL Pittsburghers have an abundance of opportunities,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “This funding will provide us with the means to get our youth involved in community process through outdoor learning and civic engagement.”<br>The City will focus its funding on developing Westinghouse Park through a community process that elevates community safety, youth leadership, and school partnerships. They are looking to prioritize equitable access to nature for Black youth in East Pittsburgh by engaging the community, particularly Black youth, in the design of local parks. With a current focus on Westinghouse Park, the team plans to target its efforts in creating new models that engage local communities and youth in park development, using the existing park development tax.<br>“The East End Pittsburgh team’s application hit every mark when it comes to our Nature Everywhere goals,” says Sarah Milligan-Toffler, President and CEO of the Children & Nature Network. “Through a collaborative process focused on updating community plans to address inequities in children’s access to nature specifically, this team is poised for Nature Everywhere’s community assessment process, youth engagement, and action planning. We are thrilled to support and join in their efforts.”<br>As a first step, the East End Pittsburgh team joined eight other communities for a Nature Everywhere Vision Lab in Austin, Texas in November 2023, to explore proven nature connection strategies and connect with technical assistance experts from the Children & Nature Network, the National League of Cities, and KABOOM!. Over the next two years, the Pittsburgh team will:<br>- Engage youth and community residents in creating visions for equitable access to nature<br>- Map community stakeholders, assets, and gaps<br>- Conduct funding and policy scans<br>- Identify the best nature connection strategies for the Pittsburgh community<br>- Build and deepen regional partnerships<br>- Develop and begin implementing an outdoor inclusion and access plan<br>Throughout the process, East End Pittsburgh and other Nature Everywhere community teams will have access to a national peer learning network; technical assistance; case-making research; resources, case studies, and planning tools; seed grants of up to $50,000; and eventually, access to larger catalytic grants for implementation. Nature Everywhere partners (Children & Nature Network, National League of Cities, and KABOOM!) will also help communities track outcomes and communicate the impact of their work both locally and nationally.<br>##<br>**About the Children & Nature Network**<br>_The Children & Nature Network believes, and research proves, that regular time outdoors is essential for children’s healthy development. The non-profit organization leads a global movement of leaders, educators, practitioners and parents working to ensure equitable access to the benefits of nature everywhere children live, learn and play.

| City of Pittsburgh Prepare For Snow Storm | **City of Pittsburgh Prepare For Snow Storm**<br>**PITTSBURGH** – Today, City of Pittsburgh Director of Public Works Chris Hornstein reported how city crews are ready for Friday’s expected heavy snow fall.<br>Workers will begin pre-treating the roadway tonight, Thursday, January 18, 2024 starting at 10pm. Crews will be on standby for the actual start of the snow fall. Crews will work through the storm until Saturday, January 20th at 2pm. However, if the storm continues through Sunday DPW crews are prepared to respond. <br>Since the storm is expected to hit during morning rush hour, residents are asked to work from home if possible or plan their travel accordingly if they must go out. The City is also requesting non-essential personnel to work from home.<br>“Residents staying off the roadway as much as possible will help DPW crews clear the roads as quickly as possible. If it’s possible to stay at home, please do so. If you stay home be mindful where you park your vehicle(s) so crews can clear your neighborhood streets,” said Mayor Ed Gainey.<br>According to Director Hornstein this storm will be slightly different than Tuesday’s storm. “Thankfully, we’re going to have temperatures in the teens and low winds so we should see better results with the pre-treatment of the roadways,” said Hornstein.<br>DPW will start on the main roadways before moving through neighborhood secondary roadways. Priority will be given to streets that will allow access to hospitals, schools and public safety facilities. Residents should be aware that it takes 24 hours after the snow has stopped to treat all city streets.

The ceremony provided an opportunity for residents to know the city is dedicated in pursuing the goals of zero-gun deaths and zero-gun related incidents.   <br>“Here’s the reality. Gun violence is something that impacts us all. No socio-economic class, racial group, or section of our city is exempt from this issue,” said Mayor Ed Gainey.  “That’s why we will continue to push for legislation that prevents guns from flooding our neighborhoods.  We will continue to push for laws to prevent violence in our communities.  Most importantly, we will continue urging our political counterparts in Harrisburg and D.C. to pass common sense gun laws to protect and preserve lives.”   <br>Improving the safety of residents is a major pillar in the Gainey administration since the beginning and that’s why a public health approach was taken to address factors that often lead to violence in communities.  In 2023, the City of Pittsburgh saw a 27% reduction in homicides and a 15% reduction in non-fatal shooting incidents.  Public Safety officials also seized 780 illegal firearms.   <br>During the event some residents with first-hand experience with gun violence shared their experiences.  Some were victims, others were those left behind to pick up the pieces after the loss of a loved one.  No matter the story, the one common thread connecting them all was the lifelong impact that gun violence leaves on people.   <br>**CITY OF PITTSBURGH PROCLAMATION**<br>**WHEREAS**, National Gun Violence Survivors Week – January 22, 2024, to January 26, 2024, provides an opportunity to honor and support those who have been affected by gun violence and to amplify their voices in the pursuit of a safer and more compassionate society; and <br>**WHEREAS**, The survivors of gun violence demonstrate remarkable resilience, courage, and strength in the face of unimaginable tragedy, inspiring us all to work toward preventing future acts of violence; and <br>**WHEREAS**, 59 percent of adults in America, including 71 percent of Black and 60 percent of Latinx Americans, or someone they care about have experienced gun violence in their lifetime, demonstrating the reach and impact gun violence has in communities across America; and <br>**WHEREAS**, Firearms are the leading cause of death for children and teens; and <br>**WHEREAS**, The City of Pittsburgh recognizes that gun violence survivors’ stories are a testament to the urgent need for comprehensive solutions to address the root causes of violence, including access to mental health services, common-sense gun laws, and community-based violence prevention programs; and <br>**WHEREAS**, Pittsburgh stands in solidarity with gun violence survivors, offering our unwavering support, empathy, and compassion as they navigate the physical, emotional, and psychological challenges resulting from their experiences; and <br>**WHEREAS**, During National Gun Violence Survivors Week, we recommit ourselves to promoting healing, justice, and prevention efforts, working towards a future where no one in our city or nation has to endure the devastating consequences of gun violence. <br>**NOW, THEREFORE**, I, the Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh, the President of Council, do hereby proclaim _**Wednesday, January 24, 2024, “National Gun Violence Survivors Week” in the City of Pittsburgh**_.

| CITY OF PITTSBURGH CELEBRATES BLACK HISTORY MONTH WITH TRIBUTE TO FREEDOM HOUSE AMBULANCE SERVICE | **CITY OF PITTSBURGH CELEBRATES BLACK HISTORY MONTH WITH TRIBUTE TO FREEDOM HOUSE AMBULANCE SERVICE**<br>_**Announce EMT Academy named in honor of the original Freedom House Ambulance Service**_<br>**PITTSBURGH** \- The City of Pittsburgh kicked off celebrating Black History Month with a salute to Freedom House Ambulance Service, the first emergency medical service in the United States to be staffed by Black men and women paramedics with medical training beyond basic first aid.  <br>Founded in 1967 in Pittsburgh's Hill District, Freedom House Ambulance Service remarkable staff created the blueprint for modern day EMS and many of its practices that remain in use to this day. <br>“Pittsburgh’s inner city produced not just America’s first EMT service but the world with the creation of Freedom House Ambulance Service. Becoming trailblazers in providing pre-hospital and CPR care,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “This year’s Black History Month exhibit shines a spotlight on the men and woman who paved the way for an entirely new profession, the paramedic.” <br>The monthlong display in the City-County Building’s grand lobby features a variety of photographs, equipment and other memorabilia showcasing the nation’s first paramedic team.  Anyone unable to visit downtown to see the exhibit, may view the content online from February 1 – 29. Which features a series of interviews with individuals involved with establishing the service as well as those currently providing emergency medical services.  Along with photographs and highlights of memorabilia on display downtown. <br>Freedom House Ambulance Service was an innovative concept of “mobile intensive care” that worked with unemployed African-American men and women from Pittsburgh’s Hill District, who served as Freedom House attendants. <br>Now, the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS is launching a new pilot program called Freedom House EMT Training, in honor of the original Freedom House Ambulance Service. This program will allow residents to obtain their EMT certifications which allow them to transition to the bureau as full-time employees. Anyone interested in applying should visit [PGHJOBS.NET](https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/pittsburgh) or [pittsburghpa.gov/ems](https://pittsburghpa.gov/ems/) for more information.  <br>Those in the program will be able to receive a living wage while attending the 12-week program taught in-house at the training academy and upon completion, earn first year EMT wages. <br>Former Pittsburgh EMS Assistant Chief and member of Freedom House Ambulance Service John Moon remembers what it was like to not have the life-saving services of a paramedic and sees the great possibilities with the new initative.  <br>“In the 1960s, there was absolutely no EMS service in this country, no one trained to the extent we were.  Here in Pittsburgh we wrote and developed the paramedic training program that paramedics began using throughout the United States,” said Moon.  <br>The City of Pittsburgh’s 2024 celebration of Black History Month is presented by Citiparks Office of Special Events and is sponsored by AARP Pennsylvania, 100.1 & AM 1020 KDKA NewsRadio and WAMO 107.3. <br>Additional information about the City of Pittsburgh’s Black History Month celebration is available at [www.pittsburghpa.gov/events](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/events) and @PghEventsOffice.  <br>**###** | 1/2/2024 19:33:29 |

| Statement from Mayor Ed Gainey on Governor Josh Shapiro's Budget Address | Yesterday, Governor Josh Shapiro delivered his 2024-2025 budget address, highlighting his commitment to investing in the most vital needs of the people of Pennsylvania. I want to express my gratitude to Governor Shapiro for his continued partnership, which will move Pittsburgh closer to the vision of becoming the safest, most welcoming city, where every resident has what they need to thrive.<br>The Governor’s budget mirrors our investment in the youth of our city, including a historic $1.1 billion increase in basic K-12 education funding – the largest increase in Pennsylvania history. Also included is a $50 million annual investment in school safety and security improvements and $300 million for repair projects in school buildings.<br>From the classroom to the community, the safety of every resident is what we strive for. Last year we saw a 27% reduction in homicides and a 15% reduction in non-fatal shooting incidents. We also seized 780 illegal firearms. Governor Shapiro’s $100 Million investment to reduce gun violence moves us closer to reaching our goal of becoming the safest city in America.  <br>The funding will include a $37.5 million increase for the Violence Intervention and Prevention program in the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD) to support efforts to reduce community violence and another $37.5 million in the Gun Violence Investigation Prosecution program to support local law enforcement agencies in their investigation and prosecution gun-related crimes.<br>Housing remains a basic, fundamental human right, yet we recognize that the availability of affordable housing has been quite scarce, even in our city. As we continue to bring new ventures and development to Pittsburgh, we will continue to demand affordable housing components. I am thankful that help will also come through the Pennsylvania Housing Affordability and Rehabilitation Enhancement Fund. The budget sets the stage for the cap on the PHARE program to increase to $100 million by 2027-28, a $40 million increase from the current cap. Not only will this program help us build more affordable housing it can also be used to help with the conversion of historic office space downtown to quality affordable housing.<br>This budget will also keep Pennsylvania open for business. Here in Pittsburgh, we have worked to strengthen our workforce initiatives, even being selected as one of five Workforce Hubs by the Biden-Harris Administration last year. The Governor’s budget will only continue to help us grow our goals, with $500 million in PA SITES funding to bring more commercial and industrial sites, $25 million to support small businesses, and much more. If we are going to be successful in our efforts to attract more workers to Pittsburgh, we need to raise the minimum wage. I applaud the Governor and join in his calls to raise the minimum wage.<br>Governor Josh Shapiro’s efforts and investment remind me of something I always say. If we want to achieve greatness, we have to come out of our silos to work together to go get it.  I can confidently say this budget reflects the power of what can happen when people come together to get stuff done for every Pennsylvanian. | 7/2/2024 11:38:46 |

Due to the timing of the snow fall, many residents will be at home, so it’s being requested that motorists be mindful of how they park on the streets. If motorists encounter snowplows on the roadway during their evening commute. Please provide space for the crews to do their job of clearing the snow off the roadway. <br>“The DPW workers will be doing their best to keep the roadways clear and neighborhood streets passable. Let’s give them the time and space to clear the roadways," said Mayor Ed Gainey. <br>Crews will be concentrating first on primary roads and those leading to hospitals, public safety centers, before moving to secondary roadways and neighborhood streets. DPW will deploy about 80 snow crews who are ready to tackle the snowstorm moving in. One thing that will not be in shortcoming is the ability to put down salt. “Thankfully, this winter has been a mild one, so far, so our salt reserves are high,” said Director Hornstein. <br>Residents are encouraged to wait until 24 hours after the final snow fall before reporting any un-treated roadways to 3-1-1. Saturday morning refuse pickup will still occur at the scheduled time, where appropriate. City of Pittsburgh residents are strongly encouraged to be mindful of their refuse bins and try to keep them close to the curb, within reason.  <br>**###** | 16/2/2024 17:19:24 |

**County Executive Sara Innamorato and Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey kick-off 10th anniversary of Learn & Earn Summer Youth Employment Program**

**PITTSBURGH** – County Executive Sara Innamorato,â€¯Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey, and other speakers kicked off the 10th anniversary of the Learn & Earn summer youth employment program with a call to action to the region’s business community to get involved. The announcement came as the Learn & Earn Summer Youth Employment Program accepts applications for this year’s program, until June 7.

Learn & Earn, a joint endeavor of Allegheny County, the City of Pittsburgh and Partner4Work, has employed nearly 13,000 young people and returned $13 million in wages to the local economy. Since its inception in 2014, the program has consistently produced the largest group of school-aged, trained, and work-ready young people in the County and City. Many past participants have gone on to college and started careers in industries including business, technology, law, public services, financial services, marketing, and many others.

County Executive Innamorato applauded the success of the program and encouraged additional participation from the region’s business community.

“If we want to grow our economy, we have to invest in the local talent we have,” she said. “We need to introduce young people to diverse mentors early and help them put down professional roots here, to understand how internships lead to careers that will sustain them.”

In 2024, Learn & Earn aspires to connect as many as 1,200 young people ages 14 through 21 with six-week summer jobs in local businesses and organizations. Learn & Earn participants also will have opportunities for virtual and in-person work experiences. Eligible youth live in Allegheny County, including the City of Pittsburgh, and meet certain low-income criteria. Learn & Earn opportunities can range from career exploration activities, service-learning, or work-study to entrepreneurship and corporate internships.

“Empowering our youth through workforce development isn't just an investment in their future; it's an investment in the resilience of our communities,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “But we can’t do this alone. We need your help to open doors and pave the way for young people to see career opportunities ahead.”â€¯

The application period for the general Learn & Earn program ends June 7. Interested youth can find eligibility requirements and the application online at or at one of the in-person application support center locations throughout Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh: [www.jobs4summer.org](http://www.jobs4summer.org/).

**More than just a job**

Non-profit partnership and the business community’s participation in Learn & Earn is a key factor in the program’s success. In any given year, as many as 400 businesses and nonprofits have opened their doors to youth for the summer. The program continues to adjust to employ youth safely, engage them virtually, and offer small group participation so they can gain meaningful work experience building digital work skills.â€¯

“Businesses that invest in young people aren't just shaping tomorrow's workforce; they're sculpting the future of their own success. By nurturing talent, providing mentorship, and fostering growth opportunities, they sow the seeds for innovation, loyalty, and lasting prosperity,” said Rob Cherry, Partner4Work CEO.

**Corporate internship**

Young adults ages 18-24 also may participate in the Corporate Internship Program, the capstone experience for older applicants with more work experience. Interns work for eight weeks with corporate hosts that offer work experience in high-demand sectors including healthcare, financial services, and law.â€¯Corporate interns earn $12 an hour for as many as 30 hours per week.

Businesses interested in participating in the Corporate Internship Program, hosting an intern, or sponsoring Learn & Earn should email internship@partner4work.org.â€¯ The Learn & Earn team screens candidates, arranges interviews, provides ongoing training and support, and processes paperwork and payroll.

| S&P Global and Fitch Ratings Agencies Reaffirm City Credit Ratings | **S&P Global and Fitch Ratings Agencies Reaffirm City Credit Ratings**<br>_Ratings reflect the Gainey administration’s robust financial policies and practices._<br>**PITTSBURGH –** The City of Pittsburgh received AA- ratings from [S&P Global](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3136064) and [Fitch](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-rates-pittsburgh-pa-62mm-series-2024-go-bonds-aa-outlook-stable-11-03-2024) ratings agencies, with “Stable” outlooks. In affirming the City’s ratings and outlook, both agencies cited the fact that our city has robust financial management policies and practices, a broad and diverse economy, and proactive management to ensure balanced operations. The administration held two in-depth financial and economic presentations with the external firms on Friday, March 1, 2024.<br>“We had the utmost confidence as we pursued these ratings,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “My administration has been proactive in our work to have a balanced budget, dynamic regional economy, and strong financial management. Thank you to our Budget and Finance teams for their work in keeping Pittsburgh on strong and secure financial footing.”<br>This rating means that Pittsburgh is viewed as a safe investment and should yield favorable interest rates on the City’s planned 2024 general obligation bond issuance. The $62 million bond will be used to fund projects in the 2024 Capital Improvement Plan, which includes caring for our city-owned bridges, flood control, landslide remediation, paving, and $12 million for improvements to our Recreation and Senior Centers.<br>“Our city is on strong financial footing,” said Council President Daniel Lavelle. “These affirmations show that we are good stewards of our residents’ tax dollars. These dollars will be used to respond to landslides, flooding, and to provide critical funding for core city services like our paving program.”<br>"These strong ratings reflect the difficult, collective work so many City officials performed to lift us from state oversight to financial health,” said Councilperson Erika Strassburger, the chair of the Finance and Law Committee. “High grades from the rating agencies mean lower borrowing costs to finance the projects our residents deserve: improving our infrastructure, investing in our communities, and building the Pittsburgh of the future."<br>The Ratings Agencies viewed the City’s financial plan as “reasonable”, with “proactive management” that will allow the City to make the necessary spending adjustments needed to keep the City’s finances strong. Fitch Ratings believes that the City is also able to maintain “superior financial resilience” throughout moderate economic cycles, citing our budget flexibility and financial reserves.<br>“This news from external industry experts validates what my administration is doing to care for the long-term financial health of our city,” continued Mayor Gainey. “These funds will help us in our efforts to make Pittsburgh a city where everyone can feel safe and welcome and has an abundance of opportunities to thrive.”<br>_###_ | 12/3/2024 13:05:52 |
| MAYOR GAINEY ANNOUNCES PITTSBURGH SELECTED FOR BLOOMBERG AMERICAN SUSTAINABLE CITIES | **MAYOR GAINEY ANNOUNCES PITTSBURGH SELECTED FOR BLOOMBERG AMERICAN SUSTAINABLE CITIESâ€¯**<br>**_Pittsburgh is one of 25 cities to receive Bloomberg Philanthropies’ support to turbocharge local climate action and create more prosperous communities_**<br>**PITTSBURGH** – Today, Mayor Gainey announced Pittsburgh was selected by Bloomberg Philanthropies as one of 25 U.S. cities to join [Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities](http://bloomberg.org/AmericanSustatinableCities). Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities is a three-year initiative designed to leverage historic levels of federal funding to incubate and implement transformative local solutions to build low-carbon, resilient, and economically thriving communities. Building on the longtime leadership of U.S. cities to confront the overlapping crises of climate change and racial wealth inequity, the $200 million Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative will provide deep support to selected cities to pursue transformative solutions in the buildings and transportation sectors through partnerships with [PolicyLink,](https://www.policylink.org/) [Bloomberg Center for Public Innovation at Johns Hopkins University](https://publicinnovation.jhu.edu/), and [Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/). <br>By participating in Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities, Pittsburgh will receive a Bloomberg Philanthropies-funded [innovation team (i-team)](https://www.bloomberg.org/government-innovation/spurring-innovation-in-cities/i-teams-and-innovation-programs/) with up to three dedicated staff with expertise in data analysis, insight development, human-centered design, systems thinking, and project management to bolster city capacity in driving progress on climate mitigation and promoting equitable outcomes. The city will also receive multi-year, in-depth, customized policy and technical assistance in collaboration with community-based organizations to mobilize public, private, and philanthropic investments. <br>“It’s an honor to be selected as one of Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities. I’m excited to see what a dedicated partnership like this can come up with for future projects to help Pittsburgh move forward into an environmentally conscious, and energy efficient city for its residents,” said Mayor Ed Gainey.   <br>Pittsburgh was chosen by Bloomberg Philanthropies for Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities based on its leadership and ambition to build resilient, equitable communities. Despite facing significant vulnerabilities like landslides, flooding, and microbursts the city has persisted in advancing community prosperity and economic development amid the climate crisis. Mayor Gainey has continued and accelerated ongoing efforts to electrify the City’s vehicle fleet, utilize the city’s purchasing power as a large energy consumer to spur the development of renewable energy sources in our region, and has pushed developers to adhere to high standards for energy efficiency in new construction. <br>With over $400 billion in federal funding available to local governments through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities aims to help cities access and implement the historic funding for critical local projects, especially in disadvantaged communities historically overburdened by pollution. This includes a grant from the Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service’s Urban and Community Forestry. We used the funds in partnership with Pittsburgh Canopy Alliance a coalition of about 20 environmental organizations working to increase the tree canopy in Allegheny County. By increasing the canopies of Pittsburgh tree count, the build-up of CO2 can decrease.  Anticipated solutions implemented through the Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities could include developing affordable, energy-efficient housing, investing in electric vehicles and infrastructure, accelerating the transition, and expanding access to clean energy, among others.â€¯ <br>“It’s wonderful to see a partnership like this form,” Said Flore Marion Assistant Director of Sustainability and Resilience, “we have had an increasing amount of extreme weather events in different ways than most Pittsburgh residents are used to, a grant like this ensures we can help out more and more of our residents deal with those changes.” <br>Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities is the newest Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative to support local climate action in the United States. In 2019, Bloomberg Philanthropies launched the [American Cities Climate Challenge](https://www.bloomberg.org/environment/supporting-sustainable-cities/american-cities-climate-challenge/) to provide resources and support to 25 of the largest U.S. cities to scale proven high-impact urban climate solutions in the buildings and transportation sectors. With Bloomberg Philanthropies’ support, the 25 Climate Challenge cities passed 54 major buildings, energy, and transportation policies and launched 71 new climate programs and initiatives, which are projected to reduce 74 million metric tons of carbon emissions through 2030.â€¯In 2022, Bloomberg Philanthropies galvanized a consortium of nonprofit and expert groups to establish the [Local Infrastructure Hub](https://localinfrastructure.org/), a national program providing more than 1,200 municipalities with pro-bono expertise to navigate historic funding opportunities made available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, develop competitive grant applications, and bring investment home to address essential infrastructure needs. To date, participating municipalities have already been awarded more than $1 billion in federal funding.â€¯ <br>### | 12/3/2024 16:51:57 |
| CITY OF PITTSBURGH PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE | **CITY OF PITTSBURGH PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE**<br>**PITTSBURGH** \- Today, the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning (DCP) unveiled a Comprehensive Plan that will serve as the guideline for moving the city into the future. The plan combines policies and goals that will be the road map for future development into 2050. City Council has approved a $6 million budget for the city to implement the plan.  <br>The plan contains details on how the mapping will be beneficial for designing future land uses. That includes where homes and businesses are developed, streets are placed with proper signage and various transportation options. <br>The City has been without a comprehensive plan that other cities and counties all over the United States use to make informed, data driven decisions on how to create strong and environmental sound neighborhoods. “This is a major investment into a more just and sustainable future to help establish a flourishing Pittsburgh 25 years from now,” said Mayor Ed Gainey.  <br>Professional consultants from Common Cause and HR&A will be working with Brown Mamas, 1Hood Media, and Alyssa Lyon to involve the community in creating a series of robust public engagement activities that will impact and inform the comprehensive plan.  <br>A significant section of the plan known as “Just Transition” addresses a significant change in approach. Plans previously had been drafted at the neighborhood levels resulting in a patchwork of plans, completed at different times, to various levels of detail. Those Comprehensive Plans were anything but comprehensive since they left out many neighborhoods input and understanding. This Comprehensive Plan recognizes those root causes and adapted to addressing a range of racial, social, and environmental injustices along with the effects of climate change.  <br>The Comprehensive Plan also provides insights into creating equal employment opportunities for residents while connecting them to appropriate jobs and brings new employment opportunities. It also focuses on infrastructure that provides residents with a sense of safety to navigate the city.  <br>The City of Pittsburgh and its consulting team intend to plan with the community, not on behalf of the community. “This work is about creating opportunities for our residents to thrive,” said Karen Abrams, Director of City Planning. “Community engagement will be a top priority in the comprehensive planning process, that helps guide the future growth and advancement of all residents.”  <br>For more information on the City’s Comprehensive Plan and to follow along the progress on the project please visit [EngagePGH](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/citywide-comprehensive-plan). <br>**###** | 13/3/2024 12:38:00 |

As CitiParks Director Kathryn Vargas explains, “Roland Ford was an integral part of Pittsburgh’s Senior Community.  Known lovingly as the “Line Dancing King”, Mr. Ford was especially important to CitiParks Healthy Active Living Senior Centers and our Special Events Team, sharing the joy of line dancing to so many over the years. His spirit and energy were a testament to how he positively impacted our community.” <br>**###**<br>This event is made possible through the generosity of sponsorships graciously given to celebrate the Senior Spirit in Pittsburgh. | 14/3/2024 12:06:40 |

| CITIPARKS RECRUITING LIFEGUARDS FOR THE 2024 OUTDOOR POOL SEASON | **CITIPARKS RECRUITING LIFEGUARDS FOR THE 2024 OUTDOOR POOL SEASON**<br>**PITTSBURGH** \- As we enter into Spring, CitiParks is getting ready for Summer and that includes lifeguard recruitment. Recruiting, training and certifying lifeguards is paramount to a successful Outdoor Pool Season and a safe swimming season for residents. <br>CitiParks Aquatics recruits, trains and certifies lifeguards for the City of Pittsburgh every year. Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the task of onboarding lifeguards is a bit more challenging with recruiting enough lifeguards to open all the City of Pittsburgh’s Outdoor Pools being the main challenge. <br>“Recruiting and onboarding lifeguards is not an easy task, and I want to recognize the continued hard work of CitiParks Aquatics.  I thank them for all of their efforts to recruit and certify lifeguards so that everyone can enjoy a great summer this year.  We need your help, spread the word and help us ensure everyone can have a safe and enjoyable time at our pools,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. <br>In 2021, the City was able to open 8 pools. In 2022, 12 pools were opened and in 2023 we opened 15 pools. This year, we want to open as many pools as possible, but that is dependent on how many lifeguards we are able to bring onboard. <br>“We continue to work hard to garner increased interest to become a CitiParks lifeguard.  We are encouraged by the enthusiasm our returning guards show each year, and we work hard to promote that with all incoming guards.  Higher wages for 2024 will help with that, but if anyone in the city knows of someone even thinking about becoming a lifeguard, please encourage them to fill out our 2024 lifeguard interest form.  Our staff works with all those who show interest and provides practice time to improve skills prior to certification,” said CitiParks Director Kathryn Vargas. Lifeguard wages for 2024 will range from $16.97 to $19.57 per hour, based on experience. <br>Lifeguard duties range from staffing normal operating hours of pools to working as head guards or as regional guards.  Lifefguards have the opportunity to learn and grow within CitiParks Aquatics that may lead to other City employment.  Many Public Safety professionals get their start in service as a lifeguard. <br>Lifeguards must be City of Pittsburgh residents, at least 16 years old by September 3, 2024. Be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and willing to work at any CitiParks Outdoor Pool. Anyone interested in becoming a CitiParks lifeguard, whether a new candidate or a returning guard. Should fill out the 2024 Lifeguard Interest Form and CitiParks Aquatics will contact them.  <br>For additional information, please visit:â€¯ [https://pittsburghpa.gov/citiparks/lifeguard-info](https://pittsburghpa.gov/citiparks/lifeguard-info)<br>Check out our 2024 Lifeguard Recruitment Video [HERE](https://youtu.be/EyDGtuXMkGQ). <br>**###**<br>_**Note:  Homewood Pool will not open this summer during the major park renovation for the entirety of Homewood Park.**_<br>_**The Oliver Bath House has been closed since 2019 for a major and much needed facility renovation.  This closure has hurt the year-round retention of lifeguards, as this facility allowed us to have a base of 25 to 30 lifeguards.  The Bath House is anticipated to reopen in Fall 2024, which will once again provide year-round opportunities for lifeguard employment.**_ | 19/3/2024 11:48:35 |
| Mayor and Council Members Propose Changes to Pittsburgh Land Bank | **Mayor and Council Members Propose Changes to Pittsburgh Land Bank**<br>_Changes are part of a broader effort to fulfill the promise of the Pittsburgh Land Bank_<br>**PITTSBURGH –** Today Mayor Ed Gainey joined Council President Daniel Lavelle, and Councilmen Bobby Wilson and Khari Mosley in taking key steps to build upon the recent successes of the Pittsburgh Land Bank. <br>In submitting the board nominations of Tammy Thompson, Tamara Dudukovich, and Kirk Burkley alongside legislation that authorizing cooperation agreements with the other taxing bodies and expanding the PLB Board to provide Allegheny County and Pittsburgh Public Schools with their own seats, the Land Bank will be better positioned to fulfill its promise of serving the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.<br>After years of struggling to move a single property, thanks to the historic tri-party agreement between the City, URA, and Pittsburgh Land Bank that was amended last year, the Land Bank will be able to move over 100 properties over the next few years. Today’s actions will build on this momentum by bringing renewed energy and important tools to bear for the Land Bank to reach its potential.<br>“I’m proud of the work that we’ve done to position our Land Bank to move properties more efficiently,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “This new agreement will allow us to bring everyone to the table who has a stake in the success of our Land Bank.”<br>The two new pieces of legislation would allow the Land Bank to enter into new agreements with Allegheny County and Pittsburgh Public Schools for the shared operation and administration of the Land Bank and streamline the process by which all three taxing bodies clear tax liens from properties acquired by the land bank, a critical step in preparing the properties for reuse. The agreements would also expand the board from nine to eleven members; The new additions to the Board would allow for a member to be appointed by Allegheny County and one member appointed by Pittsburgh Public Schools.<br>“I believe these collaborative efforts not only strengthen our community's ability to revitalize distressed properties but also pave the way for equitable development and sustainable growth for all residents,” said City Council President Daniel Lavelle.<br>"As Board Chair of the Pittsburgh Land Bank, I'm dedicated to fostering its ongoing success, knowing well that collaboration with Allegheny County and Pittsburgh Public Schools is not just integral but inherent to our mission,” said City Councilman Bobby Wilson. “We are interlinked—our efforts to combat blight and empower low-income families are shared responsibilities, ensuring the prosperity of our communities. As we expand the board, I eagerly anticipate the synergy with new members from the County and PPS, recognizing that our collective efforts shape the future of our region."<br>“The Land Bank plays a critical role in our ability to positively impact neighborhoods that have suffered from years of disinvestment while bringing vacant, abandoned, and blighted properties back on the city’s tax rolls,” added Councilman Kahari Mosley. “I look forward to working with Mayor Gainey, the County, and the School District to build on the important work we have begun this year to maximize our Land Bank’s transformative potential.”<br>“When the Land Bank was introduced in 2014 it held the promise of addressing blight in our communities,” continued Mayor Gainey. “These new agreements will allow us to fulfill that promise as we will be able to turn blighted properties across the city into affordable housing, urban agriculture, protected and maintained greenspaces, and increase development opportunities for small, neighborhood-based, and minority and women-owned businesses in our city.”<br>The Legislation can be viewed online here: https://bit.ly/LandBankLegislation | 20/3/2024 09:31:54 |
| Statement by City of Pittsburgh Solicitor Krysia Kubiak with respect to the dog who came in contact with electrical current on Murray Avenue Bridge | **Statement by City of Pittsburgh Solicitor Krysia Kubiak with respect to the dog who came in contact with electrical current on Murray Avenue Bridge**<br>The City requested and has received a report from an independent investigator who looked into the cause and origin of the incident. That report is attached [herein](https://cityofpittsburgh-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/olga_george_pittsburghpa_gov/EX7ZLtSYJNBPvUAwWlje5EUBbeXKIjWgsU8g1O1E64s2Dw?e=yjoWRY). The City intends to follow the recommendations and perform the needed inspections on our streetlighting system.<br>With respect to the news that a previous 311 call was received about this panel before the incident, the City also looked into that. The 311 call was received, and an inspector was sent out to investigate the incident. The inspector walked the bridge and examined all metal plates looking for signs of electrical current, but could not locate it. If he had, he would have referred it to the electrician. Instead, he assumed that the City did not have the proper location, and since this was an anonymous complaint, the City could not get more information from the caller.<br>The City understands now that due to the low level of voltage, a full grown adult with proper clothing would have been less likely to detect the current. As a process improvement change, in the future, these types of calls will be routed directly to the electricians who have the proper equipment to detect electrical current and the ability to make the repairs to the junction box. All of the proper repairs have been made to this junction box on the Murray Avenue bridge.<br>**###** | 25/3/2024 13:14:51 |

| City of Pittsburgh Challenges Property Tax Exemptions From Local Purely Public Charities | **City of Pittsburgh Challenges Property Tax Exemptions From Local Purely Public Charities**<br>_Over 100 parcels are being challenged, which could yield nearly $7 million annually for the City._<br>**PITTSBURGH** – Today Mayor Ed Gainey and City Solicitor Krysia Kubiak announced that the city is challenging the property tax exemptions for 104 parcels of property owned by non-profits.  <br>“We are here today to make sure our city has the resources it needs to pave our roads, pick up the snow, open our pools, and give our residents the services they deserve,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “It means that if you do not meet the standard as defined by the Supreme Court, that you should pay your fair share for the paving of the roads in front of your hospitals, for the EMS crews that bring patients to your doors, for the Police and Fire teams that help keep you and your students safe, and for the DPW crews who pick up the garbage and make sure that our bridges are operational so that our economy has the ability to thrive.” <br>The PA Supreme Court has ruled that in order to be considered a purely public charity an organization must meet all five prongs of the HUP Test.  <br>This means that they must:  <br>1. Advance a charitable purpose <br>   <br>2. Donate or render gratuitously a substantial portion of its services <br>   <br>3. Benefit a substantial and indefinite class of persons who are legitimate subjects of charity <br>   <br>4. Relieve government of some part of its burden and <br>   <br>5. Operate entirely free of prom private profit motive. <br>   <br>Failing on any one of the above prongs means that an organization can notcannot be considered a purely public charity, and as such the City of Pittsburgh will pursue payment of property taxes on those parcels through these challenges. <br>“This week, we will be filing 104 challenges,” said City Solicitor Krysia Kubiak. “As of today we have reviewed 62% of all parcels that have a charitable exemption status. I am confident that the City has an extremely strong case to make in court.”  <br>Last year the City of Pittsburgh challenged 27 parcels, and as a result of that work the City is receiving $100,000 in property taxes annually. The challenges this year would represent $6.5 million annually for the City of Pittsburgh.  <br>“Forgone tax property revenue represents dollars that could go to supporting local services like schools, roadways, parks, and social programs that support the well-being of our neighbors in our communities,” said Emily Gee, senior Vice President for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress. “Tax exemptions essentially allow charities to put foregone tax dollars toward whatever they deem a suitable charitable purpose, which may not necessarily align with the community’s most urgent needs.â€¯The public services needed to keep a major city thriving are not possible without a reliable tax base.” <br>A listing of properties challenged is available [HERE](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:4d2f4236-ed69-44b0-884a-f4051891cc6a). Here's a link to the press conference: [https://youtube.com/live/w3QzI2NBGHg?feature=share](https://youtube.com/live/w3QzI2NBGHg?feature=share "https://youtube.com/live/w3qzi2nbghg?feature=share")<br>### | 27/3/2024 14:41:35 |

| City of Pittsburgh Releases Report on Deer Management Pilot Program | **City of Pittsburgh Releases Report on Deer Management Pilot Program**<br>_The pilot program provided over 9,000 meals to residents and was completed without a single safety incident._<br>**Pittsburgh –** Today the City of Pittsburgh announced the results of the 2023 pilot phase of its Deer Management Pilot Program. The program was a partnership between the City of Pittsburgh and the United States Department of Agriculture with a goal of creating a program to manage the overpopulation of white-tailed deer in city parks.<br>The unchecked and unmanaged deer population has caused increased incidents of vehicle-deer collisions, over-eating of native plant species, and loss of natural fear. These conditions were among the reasons why the city acted urgently to create a pilot management program.<br>“I’ve heard from residents from all across the city about their concerns with the growing number of deer and the impact they are having in our parks,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Thanks to the hard work of our Park Rangers, and the collaboration with the USDA, this program was a tremendous success.”<br>The USDA recommended that the city adopt an integrated approach to the management of white-tailed deer that included a controlled archery program. Other options, such as birth control and castration, are not legal in the state of Pennsylvania.<br>From September 30th, through January 27th, the program was able to harvest 108 deer, 59 of which were donated to local food banks, and created 9,440 meals.<br>30 archers from across Allegheny County participated in the program, with 19 Archers being from the City of Pittsburgh. All participants were required to undergo a background check, wildlife violation check, and a rigorous archery proficiency test before gaining acceptance.<br>These strict participation standards not only helped with the success of the program but also resulted in zero public safety incidents related to the deer management program.<br>Due to the success of the pilot program, the City will look to expand the Deer Management Program to include Schenley, Emerald View, and Highland Parks.<br>More information, including a report of the Pilot Program and immediate next steps, can be found online at: [Pittsburgh Deer Management Pilot Program \| Engage Pittsburgh (pittsburghpa.gov)](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/pittsburgh-deer-management-pilot-program) | 3/4/2024 14:24:57 |

Because of this, the Department of Public Works (DPW) is calling for the immediate closure of the following parks and trails to ensure the safety of City of Pittsburgh residents:<br>- Lower Allegheny Riverfront Park, along the 10th Street bypass.<br>- Northshore Riverfront Park<br>- Monongahela Wharf Bike Connector<br>In addition, the Department of Public Works is closely monitoring the South Side Riverfront Park, which at this time remains open.<br>These areas will remain closed until the flood waters return to a safe level. Once safe, DPW crews will be dispatched to clean up flood debris, which may make the trail/park unsafe for residents. At this time, flood waters are not expected to recede until the weekend. Exact re-opening times will depend on water levels and present debris.<br>“We are actively monitoring the flood water situation with special attention to low-lying areas,” said Director of the Department of Public Works Chris Hornstein. “As always, safety is our number one priority and we will be proactive in closures to minimize the risk to residents.”<br>Bicyclists, trail users, and parkgoers are asked to utilize alternative routes in those areas.<br>Follow the Department of Public Works on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PghDPW) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PGHDPW) for park/trail closure updates. | 3/4/2024 16:04:40 |
| Mayor Gainey Creates Task Force on City Finances | **Mayor Gainey Creates Task Force on City Finances**<br>_Joint task force to assess forecasts and produce recommendations to preserve the City’s strong financial position._<br>**Pittsburgh -** Today Mayor Ed Gainey announced the formation of a joint task force on City Finances that will focus on ensuring the continued financial strength and security of the City. The proposed task force will include Deputy Mayor Jake Pawlak, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Cornell, Finance Director Jennifer Gula, with support from the Office of Management and Budget staff, and Chair of the Finance & Law Committee for City Council Erika Strassburger. A formal invitation has also been delivered to City Controller Rachael Heisler.<br>“We know that our residents have a lot of concerns about the state of our city finances,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “I want our residents to know that we are focused on the financial health of Pittsburgh and that all branches of city government are working together in cooperation in order to ensure that our city finances remain strong for generations to come.”<br>The formation of the joint task force comes as the Department of Finance produced a report of preliminary 1st quarter revenue data that shows robust revenue collection, with 39.2% of the 2024 budget forecast collected. Earned Income Tax and Payroll Expense Tax collections are on pace, with both exceeding last year’s first-quarter performance.<br>Based on first-quarter collections, assessment appeal dispositions formally received by Finance during the last two quarters, and conservative financial modeling, the Department of Finance now anticipates that revenues for the year will come in under the expectations established in the certified budget forecast. While the administration anticipates that this underperformance can be effectively offset through routine, fiscally prudent management practices throughout the remainder of the fiscal year and remains confident that the City will maintain a balanced budget and healthy reserves, the task force will be charged with producing a consensus response and providing clarity and transparency for the public. <br>"Bringing together everyone who works to keep our city on strong financial footing will be critical for our ability to adjust our city budget as we receive more information about revenues," said Council Finance Chair Erika Strassburger. "We want our residents to feel confident about the work we do to keep our city finances strong, and I look forward to working with this dedicated group of public servants working to care for the financial health of our city."<br>“I remain confident about our overall budget situation,” continued Mayor Gainey. “I know that with smart, prudent, and routine financial management practices we can continue to remain in a strong financial position. This new task force will create a new era of collaboration to produce the most successful response and provide the most clarity and transparency for the public.” | 5/4/2024 13:56:58 |

| CITY OF PITTSBURGH AWARDS CONTRACT FOR ADA TRANSITION PLAN | **City of Pittsburgh Awards Contract for ADA Transition Plan**<br>**This will be the first ADA Transition Plan for the City since 1992**<br>**PITTSBURGH** – Today the City of Pittsburgh officially awarded Precision Infrastructure Management (PIM CS, LLC) the contract for the first ADA Transition Plan since 1992.  <br>The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act requires municipalities to adopt a Transition Plan to identify obstacles limiting access to programs, services, and activities by persons with disabilities. The City selected PIM because they are an industry leader in Municipal Asset Management and ADA Transition Plans, with a specialty in right-of-way infrastructure, facilities, and parks.  <br>“I want to thank the Office of Equal Protection for their work in bringing the city into compliance for the first time since 1992,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Everyone who calls Pittsburgh home shouldn’t have to worry about being able to access all that the city has to offer. This much needed transition plan will help make sure that everyone in our community can live a full life here in Pittsburgh.”  <br>PIM will lead a comprehensive review of all city streets, facilities, programs, and services to ensure that they are ADA compliant, and will work with Michelle Walker, the ADA and Disabilities Resources Coordinator, to establish a plan for the City to resolve outstanding issues.  <br>“I’m excited that for the first time since 1992 our city will have an ADA transition plan,” said ADA Coordinator Michelle Walker. “We will work closely with the City County Task Force on Disabilities to ensure that our city is safe and welcoming to people with disabilities, and by removing obstacles will help make sure we all have an opportunity to thrive.” <br>The ADA Transition Plan will happen in two phases, starting with a self-evaluation led by PIM, of the City’s streets, facilities, parks, programs, and services to identify issues. In the second phase PIM will work with the Office of Equal Protection and the City County Task Force on Disabilities, and other disability advocates, to create a transition plan, with significant community input, in order to make recommendations on how to resolve any issues identified by the self-evaluation.  <br>**###**<br>[About the Office of Equal Protection:](https://pittsburghpa.gov/mayor/office-of-equal-protection)<br>The Office of Equal Protection is a civil enforcement and compliance office that seeks accountability in workers’ rights, civil rights, and public safety.

The goal is to reduce the energy burden of these households in Pittsburgh that face high climate vulnerability. This will be made possible through incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).<br>“Energy burden – the percent of a family’s income they spend on energy -- is a critical issue facing many Pittsburgh residents” said Mayor Gainey. “No one should have to choose between being able to see the doctor or paying their utility bills. This new initiative will help our residents become more financially resilient while providing new workforce development opportunities through our workforce hub, and disadvantaged business opportunities.”<br>Incentives from the IRA provide an opportunity for the City to access the $4 billion available over the next decade to advance energy efficiency, implement electrification, and reduce energy burden for residents. In a balanced approach, that will help communities positively impact the environment, the Energize Pittsburgh Initiative will maximize the impact of that funding by layering the electrification incentives with weatherization, installation of solar panels, and removal of indoor toxins, while providing the tools and resources people need to determine eligibility for grants, loans and other local, state, and federal support.<br>According to data collected in an analysis conducted by Bloomberg, 53-percent of households in our city’s predominantly Black communities would benefit from the addition of solar panels. Furthermore, many older homes in Pittsburgh would benefit from proper weatherization and appliance updates.<br>The Energize Pittsburgh Initiative will be administered by local organizations, such as ACTION Housing and Rebuilding Together Pittsburgh. Both organizations are dedicated to helping low-income homeowners live independently and safely in their homes. This effort will also be supported by an i-Team and technical assistance from the Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities (BASC) award. Last month, the City announced their selection in the BASC program. This is the first project to advance helping cities use the tools of innovation to jointly drive climate action and advance racial wealth equity.<br>“The pursuit of a clean energy future is only possible when organizations share the same mission—to enable the sustained health and prosperity of our region using our collective strengths. Energize Pittsburgh will help us secure a more equitable, healthier future while positioning us for long-term economic growth and success,” said Kevin Walker, DLC’s president and CEO.<br>In addition to the energy burden reduction, this initiative will help homeowners build equity through the home improvements made. The initiative has also been selected as an official implementation project of the Workforce Hub, ensuring that as we invest in our communities, residents can have a pipeline into good, family-sustaining, jobs, and create more opportunities for our local disadvantaged businesses on a wide-range of projects.<br>“Pittsburgh has so much to gain with heat pumps and weather-sealing and other clean, electric home improvements,” and said national nonprofit Rewiring America CEO Ari Matusiak. “The Mayor’s commitment today is a win for families who are paying too much to heat and cool their homes, it’s a win for healthier air both indoors and out, and it’s a win for the climate on Earth Day. Forty-two percent of U.S. energy emissions come from what cars we drive, how we heat and cool our homes, heat our water, cook our food, and power it all. Pittsburgh’s commitment will unlock real change for all of us, but most importantly, for the families who need it most.”<br>While Pennsylvania is considered an energy producer state, Pittsburgh is positioned as the epicenter of a clean energy economy that has and will create thousands of jobs for disadvantaged workers and business as well as billions of dollars in commerce. Residents will benefit from neighborhood homes that are no longer energy burdens and that negatively impact the environment.<br>**###**<br>_Maps:_<br>[![](https://res-h3.public.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/photo_16x16.png)BlackxHousingBurden.png](https://cityofpittsburgh-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/cydney_cooper_pittsburghpa_gov/EUOGsge_wm9IsyMUcfyVT9UBK3Syh8508Y1HVuSjx6ma7Q?e=9UEsLq)<br>[![](https://res-h3.public.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/photo_16x16.png)black resident and energy burden legend.png](https://cityofpittsburgh-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/cydney_cooper_pittsburghpa_gov/Ea-9rNXDUHJKqe9r1TWOw2QBG-CDUmvTfKnfJ_gKF29Sbg?e=p9uURL)<br>[![](https://res-h3.public.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/photo_16x16.png)Energy burdenxAsthma.png](https://cityofpittsburgh-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/cydney_cooper_pittsburghpa_gov/EW2c5x0Ss-JLlSJyMnU14p4BW17XVrkV5D4DDME8YnReyg?e=rRGQgY)<br>[![](https://res-h3.public.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/photo_16x16.png)incomeStressxRacialCompositionBlack.png](https://cityofpittsburgh-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/cydney_cooper_pittsburghpa_gov/EWOCTGYr_WVMheSYzZc6LzwBaXYLgHtOz6I0FXy4cnyFhg?e=zVgOY4)<br>_About the various Partners:_<br>**Duquesne Light Company**<br>For more than 100 years, Duquesne Light Company has provided safe and reliable electric service to communities in southwestern Pennsylvania.

| NEW PARK SCULPTURE FIRST TO DEPICT A WOMAN OF COLOR | **NEW PARK SCULPTURE FIRST TO DEPICT A WOMAN OF COLOR**<br>_**City’s Public Art Unveiled in Highland Park**_<br>**PITTSBURGH** – The Department of City Planning unveiled its newest addition to the City of Pittsburgh's art collection, through its Art in Parks program. Marlana Adele’s bronze sculpture, titled **_Flora_**, is now installed in the Highland Park entry garden. <br>Marlana took inspiration from the various historic sculptures existing throughout the park for her first public artwork. **_Flora_** reflects the art nouveau style and elements of nature found throughout her previous works and in the park. The placement in the garden allows it to be accessible to residents.   <br>"It’s important to have art that reflect the aesthetics of its surroundings and the residents who enjoy visiting our city parks," said Mayor Ed Gainey. “The Art in the Park newest piece from Marlana Vassar is an incredible addition, and we're excited to have it dedicated to Highland Park. It showcases the importance of artists and art as part of the fabric of our communities.” <br>The creation of **_Flora_** was made possible through a creative collaborative process between Marlana and community members. The sculpture reflects the community expressed desire for artwork that reflected the city’s cultural diversity and accessibility to all. This shared vision, combined with Marlana's understanding of Highland Park's history, has resulted in a piece that captures the emotions and landscape of the park.   <br>“I thought that it was essential to provide symbols of progress and possibility with this work,” said artist Marlana Vassar. “The figure is a person coexisting with nature rather than trying to tame it.”     <br>The Art in Parks program is funded from a RADical ImPAct Grant launched in celebration of the Allegheny Regional Asset District's 25th anniversary. Marlana Adele Vassar is a Pittsburgh artist who infuses her work with a blend of deeply personal narrative and rich cultural symbolism.     <br>**###** | 23/4/2024 14:11:55 |
| RIVERVIEW PARK NAMED PITTSBURGH'S 3RD ARBORETUM | **RIVERVIEW PARK NAMED PITTSBURGH’S 3RD ARBORETUM**<br>_**Riverview Park Earns National Certification**_<br>**PITTSBURGH** — This month, Riverview Park became the third city-owned park to become a nationally certified arboretum by theâ€¯ArbNETâ€¯Arboretum Accreditation Program and the Morton Arboretum. This accreditation means that Riverview Park has maintained nationally recognized standards of professional practices important for arboreta and botanic gardens.  <br>The certification, offered by Morton Arboretum via ArbNET, comes just one week before Arbor Day, Friday, April 26th when we celebrate trees and woody plants for their benefit to our beautiful city.  <br>“We know the positive impact having healthy trees have on our neighborhoods, residents' health and the environment. It’s an honor to have the hard work of the men and women who make this possible be recognized with this accreditation, said Mayor Ed Gainey. <br>In 2021, Mellon Park became the City’s first designated Arboretum. The park received accreditation from the Morton Arboretum at the urging of the Friends of Mellon Park, Tree Pittsburgh and the DPW Forestry Division. Followed by Westinghouse Park in Pittsburgh’s Point Breeze neighborhood with the support of Department of Public Works Forestry Division, Tree Pittsburgh, Westinghouse Park 2nd Century Coalition and other community groups as the second designated Arboretum. <br>“It’s evident that residents in every Pittsburgh neighborhood have a love and appreciation for our City’s trees. It’s been wonderful working with The Friends of Riverview Park group on the Arboretum accreditation.” said Lisa Ceoffe, City Forester from the Department of Public Works.  <br>The City of Pittsburgh has been recognized by the Arbor Day Foundation as a Tree City USA for the past 19 years. This certification solidifies Pittsburgh’s commitment to our urban forest.  <br>Visit the [Riverview Park ArbNET page](https://arbnet.org/morton-register/riverview-park-arboretum) to learn more about the prestigious accreditation process and requirements.â€¯â€¯ <br>**###â€¯** | 23/4/2024 15:17:17 |

| City of Pittsburgh to Launch Black Women's Equity Initiative (BWEI) EngagePGH Page | **City of Pittsburgh to Launch Black Women’s Equity Initiative (BWEI) EngagePGH Page**<br>**In celebration of Black Women’s History Month, the site will uplift the accomplishments of the administration in centering equity and future updates surrounding the efforts under the umbrella of the BWEI.**<br>**PITTSBURGH** – Today, the City of Pittsburgh’s Black Women’s Equity Initiative (BWEI) publicly launched an EngagePGH page documenting the initiative.  The page will provide more visibility into how the administration is centering equity in key focus areas identified by the BWEI Steering Committee, and ongoing progress of the initiative, which was formed by the Gainey Administration to address systemic issues that shape the experiences of black women and girls in the city.  <br>“For far too long black women have been forgotten and left behind in the work being done to move our city into the future,” said Mayor Gainey.  “As Mayor of Pittsburgh, I consider myself to be the Chief Equity Officer, however, equity is not the role of one person or office, but all 3600+ employees that serve the residents of this city.” “That means that we need to understand how the decisions, policies, and practices that exist here, impact the lived experiences of black women as well.” “By centering those furthest from equity, I believe we’ll be able to help make Pittsburgh a city for all.” <br>The Gainey Administration formed the Black Women’s Equity Initiative (BWEI) in November of 2022 to respond to various reports published that highlight the all too well-known fact that the City of Pittsburgh has not been systemically livable for Black women.  The initiative focuses on implementing solutions within the direct control of the City government — meaning the various City departments, boards, authorities, and commissions, and as an employer of over 3,600 employees. <br>BWEI is advised by the lived experiences and expertise of over 50 Black women from various intersections across the City of Pittsburgh. Additionally, the initiative is engaging Black women who serve as city department directors and leaders, who will ultimately lead the charge of creating systemic changes in City government, services, and employee operations.  <br>Since the launch of the BWEI, the city has been working behind the scenes for the last 17 months to: <br>- Establish a steering committee <br>  <br>- Brainstorm and identify priorities and focus areas for research efforts <br>  <br>- Conduct a policy scan  <br>  <br>- Produce policy recommendations  <br>  <br>- Work to engage the steering committee on the policy scan in order to produce recommendations for advancements  <br>  <br>- Prioritize partnership development with local organizations and institutions to move forward research and other efforts <br>  <br>- Develop reports to highlight the strategy and outcomes of the work of the administration  <br>  <br>The BWEI EngagePGH page will be a central location to learn about the mission, vision and progress of the BWEI. It features the steering committee members, upcoming projects, progress reports, and an area for Black women to share stories about their experiences in Pittsburgh .  <br>In March, the City received approval from City Council to enter into a professional services contract with Carlow University to support the creation of a wellness index for Black Women.  The research will include focus group discussions and other engagements with Black women of various socio-economic backgrounds.  These engagements will assist the Carlow team in quantifying and evaluating the metrics that contribute to the quality of life of Black Women living in Pittsburgh.   <br>The gathered information will be used to design and create an interactive, dynamic tool that will measure “quality of life” of Black women in a particular area or city.  This tool is something that other partners in the region can use to guide their work.  This work is generously supported via a grant that the city received.    <br>“Having a tool to measure impact is crucial to being able to tailor solutions to very specific problems.” “One thing we can’t do is shy away from addressing the findings of research,” said Mayor Gainey.  “I’ve made a commitment as Mayor that we would go first to lead the way in any effort being taken to move Pittsburgh towards being the safest, most welcoming and thriving city in America.” <br>Research is tentatively set to begin in Summer of 2024. The research and tool that the Carlow team is spearheading is the first of its kind in the region and it will be accessible to all Pittsburghers through the BWEI EngagePGH page once it’s launched in Spring of 2025. <br>For more information visit the BWEI EngagePGH page: [https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/black-womens-equity-initiative](https://engage.pittsburghpa.gov/black-womens-equity-initiative) . <br>**###** | 30/4/2024 13:35:38 |
| PITTSBURGH PREPARES TO WELCOME BLACK SORORITY REGIONAL CONFERENCE IN 2025 | **PITTSBURGH PREPARES TO WELCOME BLACK SORORITY REGIONAL CONFERENCE IN 2025**<br>_**Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated®, Great Lakes Region Will Host 3-Thousand Women**_<br>**PITTSBURGH** – As we celebrate Black Women's History Month, the City of Pittsburgh and VisitPITTSBURGH are proud to announce that Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated®, Great Lakes Region will hold its 94th Regional Conference in Pittsburgh, April 24-27, 2025, at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.<br>Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated® (AKA), an international service organization, was founded on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1908. It is the oldest Greek-letter organization established by African American college-educated women. We will welcome over 3,000 Black Women who will celebrate sisterhood, community service, and professional development among other activities.<br>“As we recognize the contributions of Black Women to American Society, it’s an opportunity to mention that some of them are members of AKA,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Their contributions range from politics, artistry, and science with such greats of the Civil Rights movement Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott-King; visionary writers Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison, barrier breaker Althea Gibson who broke the color line in international tennis and became the first American to win a Grand Slam, musical artist Ella Fitzgerald to Dr. Mae Jamison who became the first African-American woman to travel into space. Let’s not forget United States Vice President Kamala Harris, who’s the first woman to head that prestigious office. So, having this organization with such a rich history of uplifting women and producing leaders back in this city to hold one of their conferences is fantastic.”<br>The last AKA Great Lakes Regional Conference, held in Pittsburgh, was in 2015. Last year, the AKA Great Lakes Regional Conference generated an estimated $2.3 million economic impact in the City of Cleveland.<br>“We’re honored to welcome the return of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority to Pittsburgh for their Great Lakes Regional Meeting in 2025,” said Jerad Bachar, President & CEO of VisitPITTSBURGH. “This conference showcases our collective effort to recruit and support events that promote diversity, inclusion, and a message that all are welcome here in Pittsburgh. It's events, like this, that make a major economic impact and position Pittsburgh as a destination to return to time and time again. I applaud the work of our Business Events team and partners for securing the event and look forward to working alongside Mayor Gainey to ensure its legacy for Pittsburgh now and for years to come.”<br>The AKA presence in Pittsburgh via conferences has a storied history. The organization has been in the city about every decade since 1965. The AKA 94th Great Lakes Regional Conference will continue the legacy of showing Black women initiatives in building economic wealth.<br>“The Great Lakes Region of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated will paint the City of Pittsburgh pink and green. More than 3,000 educated women will gather, promising to be a catalyst for innovation, collaboration, and shared growth within the sorority,” said Gwendolyn L. Kirtley, Great Lakes Regional Director. "Soaring together, empowering unity, fostering wisdom – the Great Lakes Regional Conference in Pittsburgh is where inspiration meets sisterhood, continuously shaping strength, service, and purpose to all mankind.”<br>**###** | 30/4/2024 14:46:37 |
| STATEMENT FROM DEPUTY MAYOR JAKE PAWLAK REGARDING CITY FINANCES | **STATEMENT FROM DEPUTY MAYOR JAKE PAWLAK REGARDING CITY FINANCES**<br>“The City of Pittsburgh’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR), released today by Controller Heisler, correctly identifies a softening real estate market, property tax appeals, and high interest rates that, taken together, will have an impact on city revenues for the next few years. These challenges are real, but they are also manageable: the city ended fiscal year 2023 with a $31.9 million cash surplus; the reserve fund balance at the end 2023 was over $200 million, nearly 1.75 times greater than where it stood in 2019; and first quarter revenue collections are on pace with our projections. We do not anticipate any effect of current economic conditions on city finances that cannot be addressed though normal fiscal management and we look forward to continuing these discussions in partnership with the Joint Task Force on City Finances. <br>We have long known that 2025 and 2026 would present financial challenges for the city due to the deadline for spending federal relief funds, and have proposed budgets that have prepared us to confront those challenges while maintaining our strong financial position. As we begin the process of preparing Mayor Gainey’s 2025 Budget & Five Year Plan, opportunities to propose new spending will be limited, but the administration remains confident that current programs and initiatives, including those that were initiated in the 2023 and 2024 budgets, can continue, and core city services will not be affected. <br>The city is categorically not at risk of returning to financial oversight, a process that results from long-term, structural weakness, not economic headwinds. The City of Pittsburgh is in a fundamentally different position today than it was in 2003, and not on a course to return.”  <br>**###** | 1/5/2024 21:28:10 |
| CITY OF PITTSBURGH JUNETEENTH UPDATE | **CITY OF PITTSBURGH JUNETEENTH UPDATE**<br>When Mayor Ed Gainey came into office, he understood that his administration would be under greater scrutiny than any other administration. He accepted that challenge of accountability and visibility in every aspect since he would be bringing about change to the city that has not been experienced.<br>In keeping to that ideal, the administration worked hard to have the City fully embrace the Juneteenth celebration through financial and in-kind support. However, one of the challenges the City faced was having a clear, precise and transparent process of how public funds were being spent.<br>So, in keeping with the City’s goals of transparent use of city funds and accountability, the City did use the established procurement process.<br>To that end, we established an RFP or Request For Proposal to solicit Juneteenth events and to ensure a visible, clear and open process to request proposals from private event promoters for City funding. This opens the door to all event promoters to provide opportunities to new artists and vendors, which we believe helps to keep a celebration fresh and equitable.<br>This process was communicated clearly and directly to all private event promoters last year. In hopes that the City will be able to have a robust Juneteenth celebration.<br>Juneteenth is an important celebration equaled to the July 4th celebration. And as seen with the Fourth, multiple various celebrations are held. No one individual or organization holds the exclusive license for the 4th Celebration.<br>The City’s desire is to have additional, not dueling or competitive events for the Juneteenth celebration. This is an opportunity to uplift more people wanting to celebrate Juneteenth.<br>Juneteenth is a celebration of the freedom of Black people from slavery. Let’s recall the joy that was felt that day to create a day of remembrance, honor and celebration for all.<br>**###** | 3/5/2024 11:49:11 |

About 1 in 3 American adults are at risk for chronic kidney disease. Risk factors for kidney disease include: [diabetes](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/atozTopic_Diabetes "https://www.kidney.org/atoz/atozTopic_Diabetes"), [high blood pressure](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/what-high-blood-pressure "https://www.kidney.org/atoz/what-high-blood-pressure"), [heart disease](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/heart-and-kidney-connection "https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/heart-and-kidney-connection"), [obesity](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/obesewyska "https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/obesewyska"), and [family history](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidney-disease-family-history "https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidney-disease-family-history"). People of Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian American, or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander descent are at increased risk for developing the disease.

| Department of Public Works to Resume Annual Street Sweeping with Parking Enforcement | **Department of Public Works to Resume Annual Street Sweeping with Parking Enforcement**<br>**PITTSBURGH** **–** Beginning April 1, street sweeping with parking enforcement will resume in the City of Pittsburgh. The city’s Department of Public Works will coordinate with the Pittsburgh Parking Authority (PPA) for the enforcement component of the street sweeping campaign.<br>In the early part of the pandemic the city made street sweeping parking enforcement accommodations for residents. During that time enforcement was not imposed and parked vehicles were not ticketed. After a two-year hiatus, enforcement returned in 2022, but with a delay in the imposing of fines. This year, there will be no postponement of fines for parked vehicles.<br>Street sweeping with enforcement of parked vehicles allows crews to perform the most thorough cleaning of city streets. “During the pandemic, when we had higher volumes of parked vehicles, there was an increase in street litter as well as garbage in our storm water system,” explains Chris Hornstein, Director of the Department of Public Works. “Having open roads allows our crews to better clean Pittsburgh’s streets and prevents additional waste from entering the system.”<br>Street sweepers operate every day of the week, with neighborhoods focused on Monday through Thursday. On Fridays, sweepers are typically assigned to the main corridors and business districts. Posted signs in each neighborhood list which days street cleaning is performed. <br>The street sweeping season runs from April 1 - November 30.<br>All questions regarding enforcement for street sweeping should be directed to PPA.<br>### | 29/3/2023 13:45:55 |

| City of Pittsburgh Announces Construction Kick-Off at the Oliver Bath House | **City of Pittsburgh Announces Construction Kick-Off at the Oliver Bath House**<br>**PITTSBURGH —** The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works (DPW) yesterday hosted a ceremonial groundbreaking and construction kick-off event at the Oliver Bath House.<br>Originally constructed in 1915 as the South Side Bath House, the Oliver Bath House was a gift to the city of Pittsburgh from steel magnate Henry W. Oliver. Oliver promised the building and a monetary gift—in the form of Consolidated Coal Company stocks—in order to create a bath house that would be free for the people to use in perpetuity.<br>“The Oliver Bath House is an iconic and heavily used resource by the South Side Flats and surrounding neighborhoods. It gives our lifeguards a place to train, our youth a place to learn to swim, and our community a place to gather,” said Chris Hornstein, Director of the Department of Public Works. “DPW is proud to serve as the vehicle for realizing the community’s vision and restoring this beautiful space.” <br>Located in the historic South Side Flats neighborhood, the beloved Bath House was registered as a city Historic Landmark in February 2017. This project has been long anticipated by the community, DPW, CitiParks and Council District 3; with a lengthy project timeline.<br>“CitiParks knows that the Oliver Bath House is a beloved favorite for Pittsburgh swimmers. We are extremely excited to have our partners at the Department of Public Works moving forward on this renovation project and look forward to the grand reopening when work is complete,” added Kathryn Vargas, Director of Parks and Recreation.<br>In 2019, the Department of Public Works began the process of evaluating the facility for renovation. The original scope of work included mostly interior repairs—updated shower facilities, changing rooms, etc.—full window replacements, updated mechanical systems, and a new roof at a cost of about $1.5 million.<br>The bath house closed in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Simultaneously, DPW was initiating the planning and discovery phase for renovation with the architecture firm Buchart Horn Architects. It quickly became apparent that considerably more work was needed to bring the facility up to code. The scope expanded to include:<br>- Full replacement of the basement steel structure, including sidewalk replacement and new guardrail<br>- Complete roof replacement, including the roof deck<br>- Repair and preservation, not replacement, of the historic window frames and new glass throughout<br>- Demolition of the caretaker’s rooftop apartment and installation of a new rooftop HVAC unit with integral pool dehumidification<br>- Brick and limestone facade cleaning and repointing<br>- Repairs to the pool walls and deck, including: new gutter system and drains, total replacement of the filtration and water chemistry system, and updated lighting<br>- Repairs to the mezzanine level structure and railing<br>- Hazardous materials remediation<br>- Additional exterior restoration and conservation to retain historic character<br>- Accessibility & inclusivity: modifications to allow for ADA access<br>- Features to make the building as functional, low-maintenance, and energy-efficient as possible<br>At an updated expected budget of nearly $9 million, the planned renovations will respect character defining features of the space while bringing this building back to life so that it can once again be a usable asset for City residents.<br>Contractors—Allegheny Construction Group, East West Manufacturing & Supply, and Wheels Mechanical Contracting—are already on-site and initial construction work has begun.<br>The full renovation is expected to be completed and the bath house reopened in Fall 2024.<br>### | 28/4/2023 10:35:53 |

The distribution program is part of the city’s multi-year transition away from a bag-based to a bin-based recycling program.<br>This last phase will serve homes in the remaining northern and western neighborhoods. <br>When using the blue bins, residents must loosely place recyclables without plastic bags, which can jam equipment at processing facilities. Residents can deposit into the bins glass and plastic bottles, jugs and jars (lids removed), aluminum and steel cans, and mixed paper. Clean cardboard must be flattened, boxed and placed next to the bin.<br>“This method of recycling, where all recyclable materials are combined in one container, makes it easy for people to develop the habit of recycling,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “The more people recycling, the less waste we have blowing across our streets. Less litter makes our city a more beautiful and welcoming place where all can thrive.”<br>Prior to receiving the new recycling bins, residents will receive notification via U.S. Mail announcing when to anticipate the arrival of their new blue curbside recycling container, along with information on what can and cannot be placed in the bin.<br>Rehrig Pacific Company (RPC) holds the contract for the manufacture and distribution of the bins. RPC will deliver a 32-gallon blue recycling bin with tight-fitting lid to each designated residence. Each bin—manufactured in Pennsylvania—will come with an information packet describing its proper use, and each bin is scanned and linked to a specific address. Smaller, 18-gallon totes, are available as an alternative on a request basis by contacting the 311 City Response Center.<br>The blue bin rollout began in Fall 2020. Over a three-year period, the City of Pittsburgh will have distributed over 100,000 blue recycling bins to those they service—single family homes, duplexes, and apartment buildings with five or fewer units—with the goal of curbside recycling being bag free. <br>Funding for the Blue Bin Rollout is provided in part by a grant from The Recycling Partnership, a national NGO advancing the circular economy by building a better recycling system in U.S. communities and states, with support from the American Beverage’s Every Bottle Back initiative and the Pennsylvania Beverage Association. The grant includes funding for the final 50,000 bins, as well as education and outreach about the new collection process.<br>Residents can learn more about the blue bin rollout program and recycling in the City of Pittsburgh by visiting the [website](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/recycling-blue-bins) or by contacting 311. <br>### | 1/6/2023 14:13:06 |

This year, the Department of Public Works' Forestry Division, Streets Division, and Bureau of Environmental Services will again collaborate to offer this service at eleven locations.  <br>The City is pleased to promote Girl Scout Troops 52498, 55286, 52482, 55258 in their curbside tree pick-up initiative, where residents can set out their trees and for a small donation, the troops will collect them in January and transport them to a city drop-off location. <br>As the year closes, Environmental Services will mail 113,000+ copies of their annual recycling calendar and newsletter out to residents who receive City waste and recycling services. Residents should notice two upcoming changes in curbside collection:  <br>-Recycling is collected every other week, and the City will now only collect cardboard and other recyclable materials on recycling weeks. <br>-Recycling will no longer be accepted in plastic bags. Residents are directed to place recyclables loosely in their bin at the curb. <br>For more information, residents can call 311 or [visit the program’s website](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/xmas-tree-recycling), which includes a map to help residents locate their nearest drop-off location. <br>**2023-2024 City of Pittsburgh Christmas Tree Recycling Drop-Off Locations:**<br>**Allegheny Center**<br>Sue Murray Swimming Pool  <br>Parking Lot #301 \| Stockton Ave.  <br>**Brighton Heights**<br>Jack Stack Swimming Pool <br>600 Brighton Woods Road <br>**Brookline**<br>Brookline Recreation Center  <br>1400 Oakridge Street <br>**Hazelwood - 3rd Division of Public Works**<br>_Open Year Round_<br>Location: 40 Melanchton Street  Pittsburgh, PA 15207   <br>Hours: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.   <br>(412) 422-6524   <br>**Highland Park**<br>Highland Park Zoo  <br>7370 Baker Street <br>(enter zoo parking lot from Baker Street, follow the signs to back of lot) <br>**Homewood North - 2nd Division of Public Works**<br>_Open Year Round_<br>6814 Hamilton Ave (North Dallas Ave. at Hamilton Ave.)   <br>Hours: Monday through Saturday, 8:00 a.m. to 1 p.m.   <br>(412) 665-3609<br>**Perry North/Observatory Hill - 1st Division of Public Works**<br>_Open Year Round_<br>300 Kilbuck Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15214  <br>**Southside**<br>Southside Riverfront Park  <br>Lower Parking Lot  <br>**Squirrel Hill South**<br>Prospect Drive Roundabout  <br>Schenley Park  <br>**Sheraden**<br>Sheraden Park Parking Lot  <br>Surban Street  <br>**West End - 5th Division of Public Works**<br>_Open Year Round_<br>1330 Hassler St. Pittsburgh, PA 15220  (Off Herschel St. & Steuben St. near Herschel Park)    <br>Monday through Saturday, 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.   <br>(412) 937-3054 <br>More drop-off sites within Allegheny County are posted on [https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Parks-and-Events/Events/Christmas-Tree-Recycling-Program](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Parks-and-Events/Events/Christmas-Tree-Recycling-Program) | 20/12/2023 11:20:19 |
| City of Pittsburgh Announces Changes to Curbside Trash and Recycling Collection for @024 | **City of Pittsburgh Announces Changes to Curbside Trash and Recycling Collection for 2024**<br>**PITTSBURGH** — The City of Pittsburgh Department Public Works (DPW) Bureau of Environmental Services is alerting residents to some changes to their curbside trash and recycling collection starting in 2024.<br>City residents will be receiving the annual newsletter in the mail and are encouraged to review the 2024 recycling & refuse calendar for their designated recycling weeks. Residents can also type ‘PGH.St’ into any internet browser and search by property address for that information.<br>In the past, if residents placed cardboard boxes out on non-recycling weeks, the city would collect them in order to keep the streets clean. However, in 2024 this will no longer take place. Since clean cardboard boxes is recyclable, it will be treated no differently than recycling bins full of bottles and cans. Cardboard boxes must be flattened and bundled into manageable size for crews to collect on the designated weeks.<br>Also starting in the new year, the City will no longer accept recycling in plastic bags. Residents are directed to place recyclables loosely in their recycle bin at the curb. Residents should consider designating a recycling bin, basket or bag within their home to collect recyclables, so they can easily be dumped loosely into their curbside recycling bin. **Recycling placed on the curb in plastic bags will not be picked up and may be tagged for violation.** Plastic bags cause excessive waste, slow recycling operations, and clog sorting machinery – leading to equipment damage, higher maintenance costs, and potential injuries. To properly dispose of plastic bags and films, place them in your trash or take them to a plastic bag recycling drop-off bin, available at some local retailers.<br>Businesses can help support residents in this initiative by complying with Pittsburgh’s Plastic Bag Ban and eliminating plastic bags at the source. As the City begins stricter enforcement of the bag ban, businesses are reminded that they must stop distributing plastic bags, begin charging a minimum of $0.10 for each paper bag distributed, and post signage informing customers of the ban.<br>It is the resident’s responsibility to follow the recycling and disposal guidelines required by the city.<br>Additional information about all things trash and recycling with the Bureau of Environmental Services can be found at [https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/environmental-services](https://pittsburghpa.gov/dpw/environmental-services).<br>**###** | 28/12/2023 10:21:20 |
