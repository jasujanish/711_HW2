_Our priority is opening pools so that Pittsburghers can have a safe, fun summer! We hope that the continued growth of lifeguard staff in future summers will allow us to return to full capacity that would include offering additional programs such Infant and Preschool Aquatics, Children and Adult Learn to Swim Classes, Swim Team and Water Aerobics._
