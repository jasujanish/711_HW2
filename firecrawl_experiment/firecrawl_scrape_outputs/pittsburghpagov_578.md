# Who We Are

The Clean Pittsburgh Commission consists of a maximum of eighteen (18) members, made up of representatives from City departments, non-profit organizations, and community residents. The Mayor and City Council serve as ex officio members. Commission members elect their chair-person, vice chair(s), and other officers as needed and meet monthly (see calendar on CPC homepage).

The vision of the Commission is to be a driving force to improve the quality of life for everyone in the City of Pittsburgh, to inspire residents to clean up and safeguard their community as America’s most livable city, and to serve as a model through relentless public service and collaboration with public, private, and non-profit organizations and individuals.
