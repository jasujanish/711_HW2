# Food Festivals
Food and fun just go together and, in Pittsburgh, food is often the reason for the fun.
There's a Pittsburgh Restaurant Week celebration in the winter (https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/plan-your-trip/weather/winter-in-pittsburgh/) and summer (https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/plan-your-trip/weather/summer-in-pittsburgh/) , neighborhood soup crawls and cookie tours, apple, maple and whiskey festivals. And, Pittsburgh's annual food festivals feature ethnic or traditional foods as well as the music, dance, crafts and culture that go along with them.
