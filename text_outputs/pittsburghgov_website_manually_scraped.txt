Blue Bin Program: The City of Pittsburgh has recently wrapped a program to distribute 100,000+ blue recycling bins to residents and became bag free curbside in 2024. The goal is to make recycling easier for residents and reduce recycling contamination. Each residence serviced by the Bureau of Environmental Services received a 32-gallon blue recycling bin with a tight-fitting lid attached and an information packet. All recycling bins were manufactured in Pennsylvania by The Rehrig-Pacific Company. Please keep in mind this effort was a one-time initiative with enough resources only to distribute one blue bin per household that Environmental Services collects recyclables from. If more than one bin is needed or the original bin was not kept with the address, residents are required to supply their own blue bin, clearly marked for recycling and not in excess of 35 gallons.

Biography
Mayor Ed Gainey
Mayor Ed Gainey grew up in East Liberty and saw firsthand the economic hardships many families face in our city. Raised by a single mother, he counted on the support of his extended family and community to build a pathway to high school and college. Inspired to do the same for others, Ed Gainey discovered in college that an effective government can be a powerful tool to fight injustice and uplift communities. As a State Representative in Harrisburg he was on the front line fighting for working families, and as Mayor of Pittsburgh he'll work everyday to make Pittsburgh a city where all can belong and contribute. Mayor Gainey and his wife Michelle have three children and live in the Lincoln-Lemington neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

The Youth Civic Leadership Academy (YCLA) helps youth do the heavy lifting emerging adulthood requires by equipping youth with transferable skills, competencies, and experiential learning necessary to thrive as civic leaders, community stewards, and change-makers in the workplace and beyond. YCLA will provide opportunities for youth to access, explore, and experience career fields typically deemed off-limits for youth of color and those without significant monetary and social capital within Pittsburgh including decision-making fields like civics, education, and infrastructure.

Through a 3 phased experiential learning and project-based approach, YCLA will equip youth with insights into Pittsburgh’s past, resources of the present, and the vision of Pittsburgh's future with the mayor being a direct mentor committed to imbuing youth with a sense of belonging and relevant regional identity. Beyond a transactional or removed level of engagement merely informing youth that certain career fields exist,

YCLA provides a literal one-of-a-kind immersive and integrative experience made possible through the leadership of the City of Pittsburgh Office of the Mayor and supporting partners-the Community College of Allegheny County, the Heinz History Center, Partner4Work, and Youth Enrichment Services, Inc. (YES) YCLA scholars will not only see themselves as capable of having a career but also as being a part of Pittsburgh’s career ecosystem. Youth will earn college credit through a partnership with CCAC and be enrolled in a course that is specially designed to support their civic competency but also exposure to city departments in hopes to obtain a job given their area of interest. They will be able to participate in a circuit-style internship experience over the 11 weeks in the program.

About the MBK Initiative
My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) Pittsburgh is an initiative that originated from the Obama administration to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color to ensure all young people can reach their full potential.

The City of Pittsburgh has embraced former President Barack Obama's call to action for “My Brother's Keeper” with Mayor Ed Gainey implementing a cross-sector alliance with commitments to join the effort in creating a more equitable and inclusive Pittsburgh.

The MBK advisory committee and staff members consistently review demographic, social, economic, and crime data, including numerous community and academic reports to strategize the work of MBK by structuring our community network to meet the needs of every Black man and boy.


MBK Pittsburgh Vision
MBK Pittsburgh seeks to create a region where Black men and boys are safe and free from violence, feel welcome, view themselves in a positive manner, and have equitable access to opportunities that enable them to thrive.

Goals
My Brother's Keeper seeks to address the unique challenges faced by individuals within high- and extreme-need communities by providing a platform for mentorship, educational resources, employment opportunities, and community engagement through six key milestone goals:

All of our children enter school cognitively, physically, socially, and emotionally prepared
All of our children read at grade-level by third grade
All of our young people complete post-secondary education or training
All of our young people graduate from college
All of our youth who have graduated from college or a training program are employed
All of our young people are safe from violent crime, and those who need it, receive the second chance they deserve
Mayor Gainey and his administration are dedicated to improving current conditions within all six milestone goals through partnerships and collaboration to provide wrap-around services and resources for Black men and boys throughout the City of Pittsburgh. Together, we can foster a sense of belonging and support to empower individuals to overcome obstacles and achieve their full potential.

Highlighting Black Men & Boys
MBK spotlights Black men and boys from the City of Pittsburgh for their community service, philanthropy, leadership, innovation, achievement, dedication to public service, civic engagement, environmental stewardship, cultural preservation, and acts of bravery or heroism.

In 1873, the Police Badge was designed and officially adopted by the City of Pittsburgh. The badge is a unique design: The crest is from the Coat-of-Arms of William Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham, and the man for whom Pittsburgh is named. The garter around the badge is linked to King George III, the last English ruler of the American colonies. The shield is a circular fighting shield used by 15th century Greek foot soldiers. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the circular shield was used extensively in the British Isles, hence its appearance in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Police Badge with its distinctive design and history is worn with great pride by the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.
The Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, Inc., County of Allegheny, is a nonprofit organization. We are police officers, survivors and private citizens working together to build and maintain a memorial in the City of Pittsburgh, the county seat of Allegheny County. The memorial honors all Law Enforcement Officers who have made the "Supreme Sacrifice." It also honors all law enforcement personnel, living and dead. The Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is located at North Shore and Art Rooney Avenue near Heinz Field.
Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officers collaborate in addition to their everyday duties and responsibilities to implement and continuously refine distinctive summer camp programing that develops leadership capabilities in each child while promoting diversity and inclusion.

Description of Services
The Bureau of Animal Care & Control provides assistance to Bureaus within the Department of Public Safety, other City Departments and the Allegheny County Health Department in situations involving animals, both domestic and wild. The Bureau enforces City and State codes dealing with animals; issues citations and appears in court; helps to keep our City’s parks animal-nuisance free; works with non-profit animal shelters; provides consultation to other municipalities concerning animal issues; and assists the Pennsylvania Game Commission in tracking the rabies virus.

Animal Care & Control Officers capture stray animals, assist in pet/owner recovery, resolve neighbor disputes over animals, assist the elderly and physically-challenged with animal concerns, advise and teach residents of their responsibility as pet owners, advise non-pet owners of their rights, and assist in the removal of nuisance wildlife. Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that presents a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks. The Bureau also quarantines animals, provides removal of deceased animals, and assists police and the District Attorney's office with humane investigations.

Although Animal Care & Control encourages responsible pet/companion ownership there are still over 1,300 dogs and cats picked up yearly. Many are reunited with their homes through a partnership the City has with a local animal shelter.

Due to the wooded mountainous geography of our City, residents share common areas with a host of wildlife (skunks, raccoons, ground hogs, foxes, coyotes, deer, turkeys, etc.) Learn more about how to share space with wildlife by visiting our Living with Wild Life page.

The City offers 24 hour service. The Animal Care & Control office hours are Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Please visit our Contact Us page.

Operations continue from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Friday. Saturdays and Sundays operations are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m, and on holidays, from 8 am to 4 pm. All "after hour" operations are for any emergency that a resident may have. Call the after-hours number at 412-255-2935.

Responsible pet owners need to know that along with the obligation to properly feed, shelter, and care for a pet, there are laws (ordinances) to protect the animal, the pet owner, and the community.

"Owner" includes every person who keeps or shelters and every person who allows an animal to be on their property (land or house) which is occupied by him or her. This means that if you are in possession of an animal, whether you own it or not - you're responsible for its care, behavior, and welfare.

No discounts are available for the Local Services Tax. However, an employee whose total income for a calendar year was less than $12,000, can apply for a refund of $52 (or the amount withheld) the following year using the Local Services Refund form at the “Local Services Tax Refund Form” link.

Can you be excused from collecting the tax and paying the tax to the City?
Yes. Employers must discontinue withholding the Local Services Tax when (i) the total earned income from all sources within the City of Pittsburgh is less than $12,000; (ii) the employee is on active duty in the military; or (iii) the employee is an honorably discharged veteran of the armed forces with a 100% service-connected-disability.

The employer is supposed to withhold the Local Services Tax for the municipality associated with the principal work location of the employee. For example, if the employee has $10 in Local Services Tax withheld for Municipality “A” and changes her job location to the City in the same calendar year, then the employee must provide the employer an exemption certificate. Having received the timely filed exemption certificate, the employer only has to withhold $42 ($52 less $10 paid to Municipality “A”) in City Local Services Tax from the employee.

What happens if the employee changes his employer during the year?
The employee is supposed to provide the employer an exemption certificate showing how much Local Services Tax has been withheld during the current year. No more than $52 in Local Services Tax can be withheld by all employers from a particular employee.

In 2017, Pittsburgh celebrated the 100th Anniversary of our historic seat of government, the City-County Building (which is at Grant Street)! Explore this website to learn about its dynamic history and find out how to visit our historic home!
In 1794, the newly formed Borough of Pittsburgh established a Public Market House in the current location of Market Square. Aside from creating the public market tradition that continues there today, this location was also home to the very first Pittsburgh Municipal Hall. As Pittsburgh continued to grow, so would the space required for government services. The Market House quickly became obsolete and the cornerstone of a new City Hall was laid at Smithfield Street and Oliver Avenue in May of 1869. The County, which first courthouse was also in this location moved to its current location on Grant Street in 1836. The Smithield Street City Hall would serve until the completion of the City-County Building in 1917. It would sit abandoned for 50 years before sold for a redevelopment in the 1950's.
