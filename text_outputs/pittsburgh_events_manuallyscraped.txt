Early Industrial History
Throughout the 1800s, the Strip’s location and access to transportation made it ideal for industrial development. As early as the 1820s and 1830s, the Strip District was home to iron mills, foundries and glass factories. After the Civil War, industrial development flourished and new construction continued to move east, with factories lining the Allegheny River. The Strip District was the scene for a number of significant industrial “firsts.” Andrew Carnegie got his start in the iron and steel industries with the Upper and Lower Union Mills on Smallman and 33rd streets. The Pittsburgh Reduction Company, later ALCOA, began commercial production of aluminum in the 3200 block of Smallman Street. George Westinghouse built his first factory to produce air brakes in the 2400 block of Liberty Avenue.

The Strip is Wholesale
During the late 19th century, wholesale produce merchants began locating downtown along Liberty Avenue in the 600 to 900 blocks. Railroad tracks ran down Liberty Avenue. Trains stopped on the street and produce was unloaded directly into the warehouses. When plans were announced that the railroad tracks would be removed from Liberty Avenue downtown (this finally occurred in 1906), produce merchants began to move to the Strip District near the Pennsylvania Railroad yards. The produce station was located in a small triangular building at 21st Street near Smallman Street. In the early 20th century, this intersection became the hub of the wholesale produce business in Pittsburgh. From the turn of the century through the 1920s, industrial buildings, shops, and homes along Smallman between 16th and 21st streets were demolished for the construction of produce warehouses and offices. Auction houses and large wholesalers lined up along Smallman; smaller dealers set up shops on Penn Avenue in existing retail buildings. The 1920s were a time of prosperity, and grocery store chains began on a small-scale and helped increase the volume of business in the Strip District. Produce merchants faced difficult times in the 1930s. The Depression and the flood that hit Pittsburgh on St. Patrick’s Day in 1936 caused tremendous losses throughout the business.

Just as the wholesalers were beginning to pull out of the Depression, World War II brought about short supplies of food, rationing and price freezes. The post-war years brought two major changes to the produce industry. Trucks began to replace railroads as the preferred method of transportation, and grocery store chains continued to grow, putting small independent stores out of business and cutting out wholesalers by purchasing directly from growers. This put a double squeeze on wholesale merchants who lost both large and small customers. In the 1950s, there were 71 wholesale produce dealers in the Strip District. By the 1970s, there were about two dozen dealers left in the produce terminal. Remaining dealers began to expand their businesses by opening retail stores on Penn Avenue and Smallman Street.

A Colorful Journey
Randyland, tucked away in the heart of Pittsburgh’s North Side, is an artistic wonderland that unveils the extraordinary power of art in transforming not only spaces but lives as well. Amidst the vibrant tapestry of colors and creativity, the untold story of Randy Gilson, the founder, takes center stage. Born in the quiet town of Homestead, Pennsylvania, Gilson’s early life was marked by the harsh realities of homelessness and poverty. However, his path underwent a remarkable metamorphosis when he arrived in Pittsburgh in 1982. He emerged as a dedicated community activist, sowing the seeds of change by planting over 800 street gardens and cultivating 50 vegetable gardens in neighborhoods such as Manchester and the Mexican War Streets.
The Fascinating Dream
The inception of Randyland is a testament to unwavering vision and indomitable determination. In a bold and audacious move in 1995, Randy Gilson acquired the property that would eventually become the celebrated Randyland, all on a credit card with a mere $10,000. This audacious decision mirrors Gilson’s fearless approach to life and art. Employing upcycled materials and boundless creativity, Gilson meticulously transformed his humble abode into an extraordinary canvas. His artistic expression knew no bounds as he adorned the space with a mesmerizing array of mannequins, plastic dinosaurs, pink flamingos, and exuberant murals that depicted dancing and joyous neighbors.
Triumph Over Tragedy
While the colorful façade of Randyland draws visitors in, there exists a poignant chapter in its history. In late 2016, Randyland faced a profound test when Gilson’s partner, David Paul Francis “Mac” McDermott, received a devastating diagnosis of terminal prostate cancer. The news galvanized Randyland’s dedicated fanbase into action, raising over $20,000 to send the couple on a poignant and unforgettable vacation. Their journey took them to iconic destinations like the Grand Canyon and Hollywood, offering a bittersweet glimpse into the limitless possibilities of life. In the wake of this heartbreaking news, Randy Gilson decided to retire from his restaurant job to provide devoted care for McDermott in his final days. It was during this challenging period that Foo Conner joined Randyland as co-director, stepping into a crucial role.

The Senator John Heinz History Center is Pennsylvania’s largest history museum and a proud affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives.

Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection.

This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs.

Our Story
The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania.

In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years.

Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections.

The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today.

Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District.

With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions.

Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission.
In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum’s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage.
The Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was voted America's #1 history museum
