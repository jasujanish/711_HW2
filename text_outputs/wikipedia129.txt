Title: History 
Title: Founding 
Pittsburgh has long been a considered a hotbed for ultimate, with strong youth programs and adult club teams. Through the 2010's, the University of Pittsburgh's ultimate club team was a national powerhouse, winning back-to-back National Championships in 2012 and 2013 and finishing second in 2018, with multiple former players going on to compete in both the American Ultimate Disc League and Major League Ultimate.
A Pittsburgh-based franchise for the AUDL was announced via a private Pittsburgh ultimate Facebook group in June 2014, under the ownership of Dr. Tracy Neuendorf. Andrew Gardner (stepson of Neuendorf) and Elliot Diamond were announced as the team's inaugural general manager and assistant general manager. Gardner and others polled local players and fans at MARS (Pittsburgh's annual mixed Ultimate tournament) with slips of paper listing eighteen potential names. "Thunderbirds" was announced as the winning choice on July 9, 2014.
Title: 2015 
The Pittsburgh Thunderbirds finished 2nd in the Midwest division with a 12–2 record, behind the Madison Radicals who finished 13–1. The Madison Radicals lone loss was to the Thunderbirds on May 2, 2015 at Founder's Field in Pittsburgh.
On June 12, 2015, the Thunderbirds were featured on ESPN3's game of the week against the Chicago Wildfire, dropping the contest 19–16 for their 2nd loss of the 2015 season.
Due to scheduling conflicts, the Midwest playoffs had to be played on the same day, July 25, 2015. The #3 seed Chicago Wildfire met the #2 seeded Thunderbirds at a neutral site outside of Madison, Wisconsin at 4:00PM local time. In overtime, Max Thorne threw the go-ahead goal to Aaron Watson to secure the 24–23 victory.
3 hours later, the Thunderbirds went on to face the #1 seeded Madison Radicals at Breese Stevens Field in Madison, Wisconsin. The Thunderbirds would go on to lose the Midwest Championship, 24–21 after Tyler DeGirolamo exited the game with a recurring leg injury.

Title: 2020's 
Following the 2019 season, the AUDL announced a realignment of its divisions, with the Thunderbirds moving from the Midwest Division (now known as the Central Division) to the newly-formed Atlantic Division.
Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, the 2020 season was initially postponed before being officially cancelled on June 24, 2020.
The 2021 season would be the Thunderbirds' worst to date, finishing last in the Atlantic Division with a 1-11 record. Only the Detroit Mechanix (0-12) would finish the season with a worse record. After the 2021 season, the AUDL went back to its prior four-division format, and the Thunderbirds returned to the Central Division.
Prior to the start of the 2022 season, the Thunderbirds announced a partnership with the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC of the USL Championship. The deal included a home game against the Madison Radicals to be played at Highmark Stadium, a cross-promotion between the two teams, team-specific ticket discount offers, and halftime exhibition show by the Thunderbirds at the Riverhounds' May 14 home game against El Paso Locomotive FC.
On June 22, 2024, the Thunderbirds were dealt a 26-15 defeat by the Detroit Mechanix, snapping Detroit's infamous seven-year-long, 81-game losing streak. The team finished the 2024 season 6-6, including three consecutive 1-goal losses to end the season. The following offseason saw the departure of longtime players Max Sheppard and Pete Zaccardi.

Title: Rivalries 
Title: Philadelphia Phoenix 
The Pittsburgh Thunderbirds and Philadelphia Phoenix first met during the 2018 season, with the Phoenix winning 30-18. Although the two teams have played in different divisions for much of their history, a rivalry between them was natural due to being the only teams from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as well as long-standing rivalries between the cities baseball, football, and hockey teams. The two organizations created the Commonwealth Cup trophy to be awarded to the winner of each matchup. Philadelphia currently leads the all-time series 4-1.
Title: Stadium 
Prior to the start of the 2023 season, it was announced that the Thunderbirds would begin playing their home games at Highmark Stadium as part of an expanded partnership between the team and Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC, the stadium's primary tenant. Previously, the Thunderbirds played their home games at Founders Field in Cheswick, and J.C. Stone Field in Pittsburgh's North Park complex.
