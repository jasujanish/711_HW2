City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide
Overview of the Government of the City of Pittsburgh
The government of the City of Pittsburgh is composed of independently elected and appointed officials who work
alongside more than three thousand employees in the service of advancing the interests of City residents. The
Mayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote. City Council’s nine representatives are elected to
office by residents in each of their respective districts.
The Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures, in order to prevent wasteful or
fraudulent practices. Additionally, the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with
reporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh, the Mayor, and City Council the state of the City’s fiscal condition. Every
year, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information
on Pittsburgh’s short-term and long-term financial outlook.
City Council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also
approves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital
Budgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of
City government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole.
The Office of the City Clerk, is the centralized staff support to Council, under the direction of the City Clerk. The
City Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information
resource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. The City Council Budget
Division monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations. It prepares and distributes
to Council, periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City
of Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special
reports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations.
The Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly
responsible for much of the City’s daily operations. This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices,
Bureaus, and Commissions. The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to
debt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law
acts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments. Two units act as umbrella
organizations. The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire,
Emergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and
Safety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations,
Environmental Services, and Facilities.
Additionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City’s managerial
hierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City’s General Fund. For this reason, these
Authorities are not included in the Operating Budget.
A comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart
presented in this document.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide
What is the Operating Budget?
The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are
figures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are
spread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the
administration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public
safety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and
programming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the
routine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’
compensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service.
The City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are
collected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses,
charges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other
revenue generating mechanisms.
The Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what
governmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal
year. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in
delivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed.
The Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and
Members of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the
City of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of
Pittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire
through tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must
prioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the
City. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits
priorities set by the City’s elected public officials.
Finally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of
Pittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the
City of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating
Budget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial
creation of the plan.
Basis of Accounting
The General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh
recognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid.
The Fiscal Year
The City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of
each year. This can only be changed by ordinance.
Balanced Budget Mandate
The City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues
equal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year,
the budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide
The City’s Fund Structure
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City’s financial reporting system is organized on
a fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary.
Governmental Funds
General Fund
Capital Projects Fund
Community Development Funds
Special Revenues Funds
Fiduciary Funds
Pension Trust Fund
Agency Funds
The General Fund is the main operating fund for the City. It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain
most of the City’s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general
administration.
The Capital Projects Fund is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or
program (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to
provide a long-term benefit to the City. All projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum
value of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from
three major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds. For more detail on
the Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2025 Capital Budget document.
Community Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD). These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and
human services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households.
Special Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or
committed for a specific purpose. Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership
Fund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for
two of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund. Although many of these include the word
“trust” in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the
funds are not held by any trustees or custodians.
Fiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. These
resources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh’s own operations and are custodial in nature. The
City’s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund.
• The City administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for
firefighters, and a third for municipal employees.
• Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax
refunds. The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other
Post-Employment Benefits) Trust Fund, and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of
Fiduciary Funds.
Budget Allocations
This budget document divides total expenditures across the Elected Offices, Departments, and Bureaus that
comprise the government of the City. Individual divisions carry out unique tasks.
20 jasujazmudzinski

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget

The City utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each Department, Bureau, Agency, and
Elected Office. These accounts are organized by levels of detail, with the individual object accounts being the
most specific:
Fund ... Cost Center ... Subclass ... Object Account
The legal appropriations in the Operating Budget refer to the General Fund, which is coded as 11101. Costs are

What Are the City's Sources of Revenues?
Annual City of Pittsburgh revenue is generated by both tax and non-tax sources. There are seven subclasses.
Revenues
41 Tax Revenue
42 License and Permit Revenue
43 Charges for Services
44 Fines and Forfeitures
45 Intergovernmental Revenue
46 Interest Earnings
47 Miscellaneous Revenues
Tax Revenue
Taxes comprise the majority of City of Pittsburgh revenues. In addition to wage and property taxes, there are
many that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City.
They are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate.
Real estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. The City collects them on behalf of the City, School
District, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within
the City of Pittsburgh. Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property
Assessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. As of 2024, the City real estate
tax rate is 8.06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax
rate is 0.25 mills. Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny
County Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000).
Other sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax,
the Parking Tax, the Local Service Tax, the Amusement Tax and Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee, the
Deed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax.
Earned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn
wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2
percent School District tax. Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security,
and capital gains are commonly excluded.
The Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh’s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied
at the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed
individuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide
services within the City of Pittsburgh. Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax.
22 jasujazmudzinski

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide
Finally, the Parking Tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the City of
Pittsburgh. A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh’s pension fund until 2051.
In 2023, actual tax revenue totaled $513,723,794, or 78.1 percent of total City revenue.
City of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for
the improvement of the City's parks. These funds are not deposited into the General Fund. Please see the Parks
Tax Trust Fund section for more information.
Non-tax Revenue
“Non-tax revenue” is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not
directly involve the levying of taxes. Residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction
permits and liquor and malt beverage licenses. However, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as
interest earnings on investments, that are less visible. Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue
for the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees.
Each year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of
grants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed. For example, the Liquid Fuels Tax object account
consists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. Most
intergovernmental funding comes from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the form of pension aid. Local
entities, such as the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, and federal
agencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. In utilizing this funding, the City's goal is to enhance the
quality of municipal services and reduce the City's financial burden.
Many City departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged. Examples of these fees
include payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale
of rights of way. In addition, the City is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and
governmental entities. For example, Emergency Medical Services collects fees after it transports individuals to
receive medical care.
In 2023, actual non-tax revenue totaled $144,223,023, or 21.9 percent of total City revenue.
How Does the City Spend Money?
The tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents
ranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets. Expenditures are monitored by
department or division and by subclass.
Major expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers’ compensation claims for City
of Pittsburgh employees. The Operating Budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past
and current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs. The chart
below illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB)
contributions, health insurance and workers’ compensation.

Budget Creation Process
The operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations,
policy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by
City Code.
After receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit
proposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements,
requests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. The Mayor reviews the
proposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if
any, should be funded.
The Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September. OMB hosts additional public meetings to
garner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor’s
strategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November.
City Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After
consideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a
vote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st. Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of
the new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to
collective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. The last time a budget was not approved before
December 31st was 1931.
Upon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh’s Operating and
Capital Budgets. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City’s expenditures and revenues, provides
legislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments.
Analysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure
categories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important
management initiatives.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget
Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Guide
Five-Year Financial Forecast
In addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both
expenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise
the five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document.
The five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This
aids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long-
term impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for
long-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might
result in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus
ensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh.
Revenue Forecast
Revenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and
deliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the
rights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Projected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections.
The Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts.
Previous years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of-
year financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City’s enterprise resource planning
(ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue
line. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line.
In addition to the previous years’ financial data, the City consults with S&P Global to forecast regional economic
variables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue
generating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the
Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the
National Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs.
Revenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of
Pittsburgh’s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are
developed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are
reasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections
are finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast.
Expenditure Forecast
OMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these
forecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known
expenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension
contributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.).
OMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and
initiatives. While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are
subject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This
is accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend,
Lastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described
above. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in
achieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department. OMB compiles all such requests
and evaluates how they relate to the Mayor’s strategic initiatives. Subject to available funds, those requests that
fall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast.

The position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or “FTE,”
represents the number of full-time workers in the position. The “Rate/Grade” category indicates how an
employee’s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees
can be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a “12” in the “Hours/Months” column
indicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or
ending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The
“Budget” column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The
“Vacancy Allowance” adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions
throughout the year. A summary from 2024 is also included to facilitate comparisons.
Subclass Detail
This portion of the departmental budget includes 2023 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass
and object account level. For example, the general “Professional and Technical Services” subclass will highlight
the appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as “Administrative Fees,” “Workforce Training,” and
“Computer Maintenance.” Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2024 with budgeted
expenditures for 2025. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2024 and 2025
budgeted amounts.
Under the Personnel – Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular salary represents
the total base pay for the organization. Longevity pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining
agreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or
seasonal workers, as well as student interns. When uniform allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs
are listed accordingly. Leave Buyback represents sick leave hours that can be “sold back” to the City. Premium
Pay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. Reimbursements are funds from outside sources that are
used to offset certain position expenses.
Five-Year Forecasts
Finally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to
the 2025 budget, there are projections for 2026 through 2029. The percent change from the prior year is included
as a reference point.
Note for Fund Accounts
For special revenue accounts that are included in the Operating Budget, the Fiscal Year 2025 summary is
composed of the “Projected Beginning Balance” for January 1, 2025, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and
the “Projected Ending Balance” for December 31, 2025. These funds carry over from year to year. A position
summary follows when appropriate.

Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue
Revenue Narrative
The following revenue forecasts are intended to provide policy makers and the public with a revenue baseline to
inform the budget process. The forecasts are based on economic assumptions, recent collection trends, and
current laws and policies. However, actual revenues could vary from forecasts due to unforeseeable economic
and technical factors.
2025 Operating Budget Revenue
Revenues are divided into tax and non-tax revenues. In 2025, tax revenues are budgeted at approximately $530.3
million and non-tax revenues are budgeted at $138.5 million, comprising approximately 79.3 percent and 20.7
percent of total revenues, respectively. Total revenues are forecast to decrease by 6.2 percent in 2025 over the
2024 budget.
Tax Revenue
Tax revenues incorporate all major taxes that are levied by the City of Pittsburgh. For each tax, total revenues
include current year collections, prior year collections and penalties and interest. Tax revenues are forecast to
decrease by 2.1 percent in 2025 over the 2024 budget and to increase by 1.9 percent each year through 2029.
Real Estate Tax
Total real estate tax revenues are budgeted at $143.9 million in 2025, an estimated 5.3 percent decrease from the
prior year. The real estate tax comprises approximately 27.1 percent of tax revenues and 21.5 percent of total
revenues. Current year real estate tax liability (the amount billed at the beginning of the year) is calculated by
applying the millage rate (8.06 mills) to Allegheny County's assessed value of property. On average, residential
property comprises approximately 55 percent of the total assessed value of property in the City of Pittsburgh and
non-residential property comprises approximately 45 percent. Prior to the county-wide reassessment effective in
2013, the total assessed value of property in the City grew by approximately 1.2 percent on average per year
since 2003. The county-wide reassessment led to appeals, most notably for non-residential property, and the total
assessed value decreased by 7.8 percent in 2014. Until 2024, Since then, the total assessed value of property
grew by about 1.6 percent on average per year. In 2024, the total assessed value decreased by 4.7 percent.
The largest taxpayer incentives that reduce current year real estate tax liability are the homestead exemption, the
Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000 property tax relief (for senior citizens who meet certain requirements), and the 2
percent early-filer discount. Non-profits are exempt from this tax. Real estate tax incentives for future years are
estimated as an average percentage of tax liability based on data since the reassessment. Total real estate tax
revenues are forecast to decrease by 0.8 percent each year through 2029.
Earned Income Tax
Total earned income tax revenues are budgeted at $145.0 million in 2025, an estimated 6.5 percent increase over
the prior year. The earned income tax is a 1.25 percent levy on the wages and net profits of residents of the City
of Pittsburgh. The earned income tax forecast projects tax year liabilities based on a varying growth rate, with a
downward adjustment for the City of Pittsburgh, and splits current and prior year liabilities based on historical
collections. Total earned income tax revenues are forecast to increase by 3.8 percent each year through 2029.
Payroll Preparation Tax
Total payroll preparation tax revenues are budgeted at $77.3 million in 2025, an estimated 1.2 percent increase
over the prior year. The payroll preparation tax is levied at a rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers
and net income from self-employed individuals, members of partnerships, associations and joint ventures who
perform work or provide services within the City of Pittsburgh. Non-profits an exempt from this tax. The payroll
preparation tax forecast uses total non-farm wages for Allegheny County to forecast future revenues. Total non-

farm wages for Allegheny County are forecast to increase by 2.2 percent on average. Total payroll preparation tax
revenues are forecast to increase by 2.1 percent each year through 2029.
Parking Tax
Total parking tax revenues are budgeted at $53.6 million in 2025, a 4.0 percent increase from the prior year. The
parking tax is levied at a rate of 37.5 percent on fees charged for parking or storing cars within the City of
Pittsburgh. The parking tax forecast uses a multivariate regression with collections as the dependent variable and
the tax rate and gross Allegheny County product as independent variables. Estimated gross Allegheny County
product is the total value of goods produced and services provided in the county, and serves as a broad economic
indicator of activity in and around the City. Total parking tax revenues are forecast to increase by 4.0 percent each
year through 2029.
Deed Transfer Tax
Deed transfer tax revenues are budgeted at $42.3 million in 2025, an estimated 28.4 percent decrease compared
with the prior year. The tax is levied at a rate of 3 percent on real property transfers within the City of Pittsburgh.
The total tax paid, which is typically split between the buyer and seller of a property, is 5% as of 2020, as the state
and school board each also levy 1% taxes of their own.
The deed transfer tax forecast uses a multivariate regression with collections as the dependent variable and three
independent variables. The first independent variable is the residential tax base, which consists of existing single-
family home sales multiplied by the average price of an existing single-family home. The other independent
variables are the tax rate and a dummy variable for years in which the sale of a non-residential property exceeded
$100 million. Total deed transfer tax revenues are forecast to increase by 0.8 percent on average each year over
the next five years.
Regional Asset District Tax Relief
Regional Asset District tax relief is budgeted at $27.3 million in 2025, an estimated 6.2 percent increase over the
prior year. This relief, created by Pennsylvania Act 77 of 1993, provides the City of Pittsburgh with a percentage of
1/4 of the 1 percent additional sales tax in Allegheny County. The City of Pittsburgh’s percentage is determined by
a formula that compares the City’s tax revenues and the market value of property per capita with that of all
municipalities in Allegheny County. Retail sales (a proxy for sales tax collections) are forecast to grow by 2.4
percent on average over the same period. Act 77 tax relief is forecast to increase by 2.5 percent each year
through 2029.
Amusement Tax
Total amusement tax revenues are budgeted at $19.5 million in 2025, an estimated 3.1 percent increase over the
prior year. The amusement tax is levied at a rate of 5 percent on the gross admission to events that provide
entertainment within the City of Pittsburgh, excluding non-profit performing arts organizations. Amusement tax
collections are primarily motivated by sporting events within the City. Revenues from the three professional sports
teams have historically comprised 70 percent of amusement tax revenues on average per year. Revenues from
opposing teams and non-resident performers comprise the remainder of the amusement tax revenues. A sports
teams and clubs economic indicator is used to forecast 70 percent of amusement tax revenues. The remaining 30
percent is forecast with consumer price index (inflation) to generate a more conservative forecast. Total
amusement tax revenues are forecast to increase by 2.5 percent each year through 2029.

City of Pittsburgh to project revenues. Total local service tax revenues are forecast to decrease by 0.9 percent per
year through 2029.

To offset the revenue loss from phasing out the tax on non-profit performing arts organizations, the non-resident
sports facility usage fee was established in 2005. Total non-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are
budgeted at $6.1 million in 2025, an estimated 39.6 percent increase over the prior year. The fee is 3 percent of

Expenditure Summary
Fiscal Year 2025 Expenditures
Expenditures total $665,619,090 in fiscal year 2025. The five largest divisions in fiscal year 2025, with respect to
total appropriated budget, are: Department of Finance, Bureau of Police, Bureau of Fire, Department of Human
Resources and Civil Service, and the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services. In total, these departments account
for 70.8 percent of total expenditures in the 2025 Operating Budget. The Department of Finance’s budget is
particularly large because all debt service and pension related costs are appropriated within the department’s
budget. Similarly, appropriations placed in the Department of Human Resources budget include legacy citywide
retiree health benefits.

Five-Year Expenditure Forecast
The 2025 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan submitted by the City highlights the Mayor's commitment to
financial sustainability, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, and strengthening
financial management practices. The City plans to achieve these by:
• Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services
• Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations
• Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and
provide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases
• Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary
The 2025 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and
improve the City’s long-term fiscal health by:
• Allocating an additional $282 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated
minimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC)
• Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City’s debt burden totaling 11.1 percent of General
Fund expenditures in 2025
• Allocating a $12.7 million in "pay-as-you-go" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan
In addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key
components and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following:
• Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase
workplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost
management initiative.
• Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees,
workers' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer
contributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few
years, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee
52 jasujazmudzinski

Fiscal Year 2025 Expenditures
health and managing costs. Pension projections incorporate initiatives related to increased pension
funding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment.
• Other Non-Personnel Operating Costs: Projections for this category incorporate contractually required
costs that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across
each department.
• Debt Service: The forecast compares known debt service schedules with estimates for anticipated future
issuances to determine debt service. This helps practitioners decide whether the City will be able to
responsibly issue bonds to address the City’s critical infrastructure needs.
• PAYGO: The City funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the General Fund into the
Capital Projects Fund each year. PAYGO (or “pay-as-you-go”) transfers are funds that the City spends on
capital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds. In the 2025 Capital
Improvement Plan, projects funded with PAYGO are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement,
economic development, and blight remediation. The forecast assumes that the City will continue to
contribute PAYGO funds for capital projects consistent with Chapter 218 of the City Code, contributing
$12.704175 million in 2025 and a total of $20.7 million from 2026 to 2029.
Most non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout
fiscal year 2029. Debt Service will decrease significantly in 2027.

The 2025 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan achieves substantial improvements in terms of the percentage of
total expenditures related to debt service. In fiscal year 2015 expenditures related to debt service reached
$89,289,167. This represented 18.6 percent of total budgeted expenditures. In the 2025 Operating Budget, total
planned expenditures related to debt service is $73,949,315, or 11.1 percent of total budgeted expenditures. This
trend illustrates the City’s commitment to long term financial health. The long term impact of this plan will allow the
City to responsibly borrow at more favorable rates, comply with the City’s debt policy, and provide resources to
invest in the City’s assets.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget City Council Districts
Fiscal Year 2025 101100
Description of Services
City Council is the legislative branch of government and consists of nine members. Each Member represents one
Council District, and is appointed to be the chairperson of a committee which corresponds to one or more City
Departments. Council carries out duties in accordance with the Home Rule Charter and the laws of the state, and
is primarily responsible for making laws which govern the City of Pittsburgh. City Council proposes, debates, and
votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also approves appointments as provided by the
Charter, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final operating and capital budgets for the City.
Since the legislative power of the City is solely vested in the Council, the introduction of legislation necessary for
the operations of all City Departments must be introduced by City Council members through their representative
committees. Council members also introduce ordinances and resolutions which directly address policy and
budgetary issues.
City Council is entrusted with the review and approval of all City laws. Council members interact with City
Departments, other units of government, and the general public as a means to obtain information pertinent to their
decision-making process.

The Office of Management and Budget is organized into the following core teams to strengthen citywide financial

technologies; and the management of enterprise-wide projects that will have a significant financial and/or
operational impact. The Grants Office is housed within this group.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Commission on Human Relations
Fiscal Year 2025 105000
Mission
The Commission on Human Relations is the official Civil Rights enforcement agency for the City of Pittsburgh,
and is empowered by Chapters 651-659 of the Pittsburgh City Code to investigate instances of discrimination,
conduct outreach and provide education to the community, conduct research, and recommend additional
protections in the City Code to provide all people in Pittsburgh with equal opportunities. The Commission’s
mission is to decrease unfair treatment and discrimination by promoting justice and understanding among
communities in the City of Pittsburgh.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
The Commission receives and investigates complaints of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, and
public accommodations within the jurisdiction of the City. The Commission also provides outreach and education
services regarding rights and responsibilities under the Fair Practices Ordinances (PCC: 651-659). These
functions are performed within the following program areas:
Unlawful Practices Administration and Enforcement - As provided in the City Code, the Commission’s
mandate is to receive, investigate, and adjudicate complaints of discriminatory practices in the areas of
employment, housing, and public accommodations. This office is also charged with the responsibility for the
receipt, investigation, and adjudication of complaints alleging civil rights violations by City employees in the
exercise of their duties as City employees. The Commission is charged with seeking the satisfactory resolution or
adjustment of all complaints through negotiation, mediation, and conciliation.
Inter-Group/Police Community Relations - The Commission studies, investigates, holds public hearings, and
conciliates issues in the community that adversely affect inter-group relations, negatively impact the livability of
city neighborhoods, and lead to civil unrest.
Education and Outreach - The Commission provides information on the laws it enforces and its work in the area
of community relations through the use of a wide variety of tools including presentations and programs specifically
targeted to reach the particular needs of all segments of the population, including the City workforce. These
services complement the Commission’s work in the area of enforcement and serve to reduce prejudice, enhance
inter-group relations, increase understanding of our need for unity, and bring about a greater level of awareness
and compliance with the law. The Commission also works to further the City’s commitment to the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), especially those focused on peace, justice, and strong institutions.
2024 Accomplishments

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Department of Finance
Fiscal Year 2025 107000
Mission
The Finance Department provides fiscal leadership for the City focused on long-term financial health while
respecting the interests of its residents. It also carries an important responsibility to ensure all entrepreneurs,
visionaries, and leaders have the necessary services and city infrastructure to thrive. As the City of Pittsburgh’s
primary revenue generator, the Finance Department is committed to excellence in financial management for the
City, its residents, and its businesses.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
The Finance Department is responsible for the collection, deposit, and investment of all funds received by the City
from any source. The Department bills and collects tax and fee revenue, intergovernmental payments, grant
payments, lease payments, and other payments due to the City. The Department also manages tax abatements
(including homestead and senior citizen exemptions), tracks tax increments, and performs tax audits designed to
help businesses submit returns timely and enforce tax laws. The Department is also the designated tax collector
for the Pittsburgh School District and the Carnegie Library.
In addition to collections of revenue, the Finance Department performs a number of other functions. This includes
the sale of tax delinquent properties through Treasurer’s Sales, sale of City-owned property, tax assessment
appeals, and citywide cash management. The Department performs business tax audits and ensures that money
owed to the City is collected in a timely manner. The Department also manages City debt through bonds and
borrowing and manages the City’s Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund. To ensure accuracy and
transparency the Department also facilitates citywide annual single and pension audits.
The Department has five major divisions, each with several sub-sections, led by the Director and Deputy Director.
Administration and Treasury Division - The Director of Finance oversees all departmental functions and
policies and is responsible for managing debt functions. The Director also oversees all collections and billing of
taxes as City Treasurer and is responsible for communicating and interacting with the City Council. The Director/
City Treasurer units are responsible for managing all administrative functions. The City Treasurer is the
designated Treasurer for the Pittsburgh School District, is responsible for tax collections related to the District, and
is the responsible agent for the collection and distribution of the Carnegie Library portion of real estate taxes. The
Treasurer oversees the collection of the earned income tax through the City’s contractor, Jordan Tax Services.
Business Intelligence Division - The Business Intelligence Unit (BIU) reports to the Director of Finance. This
unit is responsible for all operation improvement projects within the Department as well as citywide organizational
processes and performance. This unit manages all requests for proposals originating in the department, manages
projects to include major technology updates, and recommends and implements new datasets and open data
initiatives. The Business Intelligence Unit is also responsible for managing the credit card programs citywide and
all legislation processes required to manage citywide contracts. It is also responsible for creating policies to align
with department goals to increase efficiency and productivity. The unit focuses on improvements that will help
increase revenue as well as lower operational costs citywide.
Real Estate Division - This unit manages all real estate activity including property tax, city property sales,
Treasurer's sales as well as abatement and delinquencies. The Real Estate division is the designated collector for
the Pittsburgh School District and Carnegie Library and ensures that the property tax and any delinquencies on
accounts are collected for the current year. The Real Estate division manages the entire real estate inventory
online for the public to search and apply for properties that are for sale. The division works with property buyers,
delinquency collectors, the School District, County Assessor’s Office, the Urban Redevelopment Authority, and the
Law department to return property to the tax rolls and expedite the sales processes.

investigations, and issuing citations to ensure that all money owed is collected and that taxpayers comply with the
City ordinance.

The mission of the Ethics Hearing Board is to preserve the trust placed in the public servants of the City, to
promote public confidence in government, to protect the integrity of government decision making, and to enhance
government efficiency.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
The Ethics Hearing Board comprises nine members with reputations of personal integrity and honesty. Designed
to be an impartial arm of government, seven of its nine members are selected by community organizations. The
Board’s staff includes an Executive Director.
Those served by the Board include current, former, and prospective officials and employees (including those
acting under contract), consultants, campaign contributors, and persons and entities who do or seek to do
business with the City, third parties involved with covered conduct, and those who give gifts to covered parties or
their relatives. Ethics Hearing Board services include:
Advice - Formal advisory opinions and informal consultations are critical services of the Board and its Ethics
Officer. Only the Board’s formal advice (and not private counsel) is a defense from penalties.
Education - Employee guidance, policies, trainings; public information to build trust in government.
Disclosures - The Statement of Financial Interests, Disclosure of Interests, Statement of Affiliations, conflict of
interest, campaign finance, and gift disclosures (starting at $100 aggregate). Disclosures relating to Valuable Gifts
Review (at $500) and waivers are issued with formal advice.
Campaign Finance - Early reporting, outreach, management, audits, confirming campaign finance contribution
limits compliance and other requirements.
Enforcement - Public complaints, preliminary inquiries, investigations, panel meetings, and hearings to evaluate
alleged misconduct; legal action and additional steps to collect fines and penalties.
2024 Accomplishments
• Legislation: Extensively analyzed several proposals to update legislation to be able to issue a new Code
of Conduct handbook, and related training
• Advice: Increased access by creating an online advice request form for easy use by former employees,
appointed public officials, nominees, vendors, candidates, campaign donors, gift donors, affiliated family
members, and others under the Board’s jurisdiction who do not have City of Pittsburgh email/ intranet
access; issued formal advisory opinions (a 275% increase), informal guidance, and new regulations
• Campaign finance: Collaborated with the Clerk’s Office and Council to strategize best methods to
streamline the filing process for candidates and their committees
• Disclosures: Overhauled the Statement of Affiliations for improved identification of potential conflicts
• Investigations and Enforcement: Continued efforts to investigate and, when applicable, prosecuted ethics
complaints and enforced violations

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Department of Public Safety - Bureau of Administration
Fiscal Year 2025 210000
Mission
The mission of the Department of Public Safety is to provide for the security and safety of all residents and
patrons of the City of Pittsburgh through the oversight and execution of the public safety operational strategies
through the planned and coordinated efforts of the Bureaus of Police (PBP), Fire (PBF), Emergency Medical
Services (EMS), and Animal Care and Control (ACC). This mission includes the creation of a command team with
representatives from PBP, PBF, and EMS acting in conjunction as the Office of Emergency Management (OEM).
We strive to improve community and first responder safety through integrated response, training, technology, fleet
upgrades, and increased community visibility as well as enhancing and enforcing team collaboration across all
Public Safety Bureaus. We attempt to further our mission through the streamlining of administrative positions to
provide cross training support, and improve oversight on resources, spending, and hiring practices.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
Administration - The Bureau of Administration contains the Office of the Director of the Department of Public
Safety. It is a managed entity responsible for standardizing practices, policies, response efforts, technology, and
communication between all bureaus. It provides oversight and inter-bureau coordination of personnel, resources,
facilities, and finances. While each of the bureaus remain independent, the Department has streamlined uniform
policies, reporting structures, and financial management.
Community Outreach - The Office of Community Outreach serves as a liaison between the City of Pittsburgh’s
residents and community groups and the Department of Public Safety. The Community Outreach staff is
responsible for coordinating and maintaining numerous Public Safety community relations initiatives. In an effort
to keep residents safe and improve their quality of life, the Outreach staff educates and provides the public with
general safety, crime prevention, and various life enhancing resources. These initiatives are conducted through
meetings, workshops, and community sponsored events. The Department of Public Safety Community Outreach
efforts can be classified into four categories - Safer Together Pittsburgh, Youth Policy, Victim Assistance, and the
Ranger program.
• Through its growing partnerships with residents, local businesses, and community organizations, Safer
Together Pittsburgh strives to build and maintain strong communicative relationships between the City of
Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Bureaus and City of Pittsburgh residents. The Public Safety Zone Councils
continue to be an instrumental tool in the success of the Safer Together Pittsburgh Outreach initiatives.
This relationship affords the Department of Public Safety the opportunity to closely assess the safety
needs and concerns of residents. In addition, this relationship allows the department to better utilize its
resources to meet the needs and service expectations of underserved communities and populations.
• Youth Policy programs are designed to identify the safety needs of children and youth. Programming is
structured to nurture healthy relationships between the City of Pittsburgh youth and Public Safety
personnel. In conjunction with the services of the Public Safety Bureaus, a combination of City, County,
and State resources are utilized to ensure that the safety requirements of this vulnerable population are
fulfilled.
• Victim Assistance provides information and support to City residents and families that are victims of crime
and natural or man-made disasters. A Victim Assistance Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that
victims of crimes investigated by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, or national or man-made disaster are
afforded the opportunity to receive services and support for long-term safety needs as permissible by law.
This position coordinates the day-to-day operational aspects as well as works with law enforcement on
training and maintaining community awareness of services available to victims of crime and natural or
man-made disasters, and liaises with City and County agencies to ensure coordinated services.
• The Park Ranger Program is a vital connection between the City of Pittsburgh’s parks and its park users.
Park Rangers act as park ambassadors for the Department of Public Safety by educating park visitors/
users on park offerings, programs, activities, local ordinances, rules, and regulations. Park Rangers also
engage park visitors in mutually respectful ways that benefit and develop relationships and appropriate
park use.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Department of Public Safety - Bureau of Administration
Fiscal Year 2025 210000
Nighttime Economy - Nighttime Economy supports the food, beverage and entertainment events that enhance
Pittsburgh’s quality of life and attractiveness to visitors and relocating companies. However this industry can
present unique potential public safety risks and quality of life impacts. Further, consumer demand is forceful and
trends populate quickly, often well in advance of policies that could address issues. Responsible Hospitality
includes planning, monitoring, managing, and policing. The Nighttime Economy Coordinator facilitates these
activities and upholds Sociable City Pittsburgh’s vision: “Safe and vibrant places to socialize for visitors and
Pittsburghers of all ages, cultures and lifestyles” and the Sociable City's mission: “Retain and grow the economic
value of the social and nighttime economy while effectively preventing and addressing nuisance activities,
managing public safety risks and alleviating quality of life impacts.” The Nighttime Economy Coordinator is
additionally charged with implementing the long range recommendations from the Sociable City Plan, as well as
facilitating key stakeholders to guide policy changes and resource allocation to support and sustain Pittsburgh’s
nighttime economy.
Group Violence Intervention Initiative - Group Violence Intervention (GVI) plays a crucial role in reducing
neighborhood violence. It is partnership between law enforcement, street outreach workers, social services and
the community who mediates and interrupts violence from spreading.
Office of Emergency Management - The Office of Emergency Management (OEM) works to reduce the
vulnerability of the populace and property of the City to injury and loss resulting from natural or man-made
disasters. This office also provides prompt and efficient rescue, care, and treatment of persons threatened or
victimized by disaster; provides for rapid and orderly restoration and recovery following disasters; and educates
the public regarding their responsibilities in responding to disasters affecting the City of Pittsburgh. Comprised of
representatives from PBP, PBF, and EMS, with oversight by the Director’s office, the restructured OEM works
together with other departments to formulate strategies and policies for planned events, and potential natural and
man-made events utilizing the National Incident Management System.
Office of Film & Event Management - The newly organized Office of Film & Event Management is currently
comprised of two full-time staff who are tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale
events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh. It is responsible for consulting with both film and event
permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met, as
well as working with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of events and
film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City’s
operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents. Lastly, this office chairs the Special Events
Committee and assists in the safe and effective planning of large scale City-wide events.
Public Information Office/Media - The Public Information Office budget includes four full-time employees: One
Public Information Officer, one Deputy Public Information Officer, one Assistant Public Information Officer, and one
Social Media Specialist. The PIO Office’s mission is to tell the whole story of Public Safety, not just what the
media covers, and to foster a collaborative environment between Public Safety and the public by promoting and
practicing transparency. The PIO’s Office provides information to the public, primarily through social media but
also through traditional media, on behalf of all Public Safety departments.
Public Safety Technology - The Office of Public Safety Technology coordinates closely with the City's
Department of Innovation & Performance, bureau technology subject matter experts, other departments and
partner agencies to enhance safety and awareness of Public Safety personnel by assessing both existing and
new technology, infrastructure, and solutions utilized by responders in their daily activities. The Public Safety
Technology Manager ensures critical public safety technology and systems function efficiently and effectively on a
24/7 basis including citywide security camera deployment, the gunshot detection system, radio communications,
and Public Safety-specific software. The Manager works closely with outside entities to allow all bureaus to have
the technical resources necessary to ensure the safety of the residents, visitors, and employees of the City of
Pittsburgh.
Special Inter-Bureau Operations - Special Inter-Bureau Operations includes emergency response requiring
personnel, equipment, and resources from EMS, Fire, Police, Emergency Management, Animal Care and Control,
and the Rangers. These operations include on-going operational training, readiness, planning, and provide
156 jasujazmudzinski

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Department of Public Safety - Bureau of Administration
Fiscal Year 2025 210000
resources to incidents such as hazardous material release, active shooter events, flood response, high rise fires,
and terrorist attacks.
Public Safety Facilities - The Office of Public Safety Facilities coordinates closely with the Director of the
Department of Public Safety, the various Bureau Chiefs within the Department, and the Department of Public
Works regarding Public Safety facilities. The Office ensures that systems and chains-of-communications are in
place to support the goals and objectives of the Department of Public Safety. The Office manages or leads all
facility work flow, including work order processing/follow-up, working with the Department of Public Works to
identify and develop proposals for critical facilities capital projects, performing routine inspections, assisting in the
preparation of grant applications and legislation supporting Public Safety facilities requirements, and insuring the
proper disposal of excess equipment and material. The Office has extensive interaction with all City departments
and outside agencies to include: various county, state, and federal law enforcement, correctional, facility
management, and risk management agencies. The Office also has the additional duties of City-County Building
Fire Marshal, City-County Building Radiation Safety Officer and working with Allegheny County on providing

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Bureau of Emergency Medical Services
Fiscal Year 2025 220000
Mission
The Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is dedicated to the reduction of morbidity and mortality of
residents and visitors through the provision of Advanced and Basic Life Support pre-hospital care, medically
directed rescue, and transportation of the ill and injured.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
The Bureau of EMS provides advanced life support, pre-hospital care, and transportation for the sick and injured
through the deployment of thirteen advanced life support ambulances, each staffed by Pennsylvania Department
of Health Certified Paramedics. In addition to the advanced life support units the bureau also staffs four basic life
support ambulances staffed by Pennsylvania Department of Health Certified Emergency Medical Technicians.
Strategically located throughout the City, the Bureau will operate thirteen advanced life support (ALS) and three
basic life support (BLS) ambulances 24 hours per day when at full staffing capacity.
With advanced training and technology, the Bureau of EMS is delivering cutting-edge care by providing new
treatment modalities that allow for more effective recognition and treatment of heart attacks, strokes, cardiac
arrest, and a number of other life threatening conditions. For patients experiencing ST Elevation Myocardial
Infarction (STEMI), EMS has the ability to screen and directly transmit an EKG to the receiving hospital and
activate the cardiac cauterization laboratory prior to arrival, greatly reducing the time to definitive treatment.
The Bureau of EMS also provides integrated medically-directed rescue for vehicle accidents, industrial accidents,
high and low angle rope rescues, confined space emergencies, building collapse, elevator emergencies, and
others. The base service is comprised of two specially equipped rescue trucks, each staffed by two paramedics,
operating 24 hours a day. All Pittsburgh Paramedics are trained and certified for vehicle and basic rescue
practices. Those paramedics assigned to the Rescue Division receive additional rescue training and certifications.
The Bureau of EMS is also an integral part of three joint public safety teams: River Rescue, SWAT, and the
Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Team. For each team, EMS provides an administrative and leadership role as well
as a cadre of highly qualified personnel and instructors.
For River Rescue, EMS provides two Paramedic Public Safety SCUBA divers to staff the units. The Bureau of
Police assigns an officer/helmsman who provides a law enforcement component to the units. This unit conducts
port security and safety patrols on a routine basis.
For the SWAT Team, EMS provides trained Tactical EMS (TEMS) personnel who have undergone all of the
required SWAT training in addition to specialized treatment under fire training. They respond as an integral
element of the SWAT Team to multiple incidents such as barricaded persons, high risk warrants, and dignitary
protection.
For the Hazmat Team, EMS participates with the Bureaus of Fire and Police, providing personnel trained and
certified to the Technician level for entry, evaluation, mitigation, and decontamination. EMS also provides the
required medical monitoring for pre-entry and post-entry for an incident.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Bureau of Fire
Fiscal Year 2025 250000
Mission
It is the mission of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire (PBF) to protect life, property, and the environment by providing
effective customer and human services related to fire suppression, emergency medical services, hazard
mitigation, emergency management services, and domestic preparedness.
The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire encourages all personnel to take a proactive role in reducing the impact from
emergencies by providing programs related to fire prevention, public education, community relations, risk
reduction, disaster planning, homeland security, and operational training. All services provided to the residents
and visitors of the City of Pittsburgh, the County of Allegheny, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be
delivered in the most professional manner, to the best of our ability.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
The roles and responsibilities of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire as related to public safety include emergency
medical care, fire investigation, code enforcement, training, logistics, and suppression. Suppression and
emergency medical services are the largest functional area in terms of responsibility and resources. The
suppression function is the activity of containing and extinguishing a fire. The goals of the suppression division are
to protect lives, property and the environment. The PBF expanded its emergency medical service capabilities by
becoming a licensed emergency medical care provider issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The
Bureau provides these services through the following four divisions:
Administration - Provides managerial and administrative services for the Bureau. This activity includes budget
and finance; payroll; employee relations, strategic planning; record and data gathering, facility and fleet
management.
Operations - Provides emergency incident response to protect the lives and property of city residents and
visitors. In addition to extinguishing fires, controlling hazardous material emergency incidents, flood response, and
emergency management, the personnel in this service area are responsible for providing emergency medical care
to sick and injured individuals. The Fire Bureau responds to approximately 20,000 emergency medical calls each
year.
Planning and Training - Provides training, communications, and logistics for the Bureau of Fire. The Training
Academy implements employee development programs for fire suppression personnel. The programs consist of
fire suppression, apparatus driving operations, emergency medical responder, hazardous material, technical
rescue, vehicle rescue, and disaster response topics. The PBF expanded its role in disaster preparedness and
response, which includes increased capabilities to provide swift-water rescue, as well as taking a proactive role in
planning and preparation for a disaster involving crude oil being transported by rail through the City of Pittsburgh,
and other transportation emergencies. All new recruits must complete 32 weeks of basic training before being
assigned to a permanent station within the PBF. In addition to recruit training, continuing education is required for
all members of the PBF. The Bureau also provides public education to various community organizations and City
programs such as the Civic Leadership Academy.
Risk Management - Enforces the City’s hazardous material code, the International Fire Code, investigates
complaints of life-threatening and unsafe conditions, and conducts fire investigations. It is also responsible for the
health and safety of Bureau employees through preventive and corrective measures.
2024 Accomplishments
• The Bureau of Fire graduated a class of 39 firefighter recruits.
• The Bureau of Fire maintained up-to-date certifications for its Swiftwater Rescue Team, further enhancing
the capability and response of the Bureau on the City's three rivers.
• The Bureau of Fire continued to further gender equity by hosting the Girl's Fire Camp for the third
consecutive year.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Office of Community Health and Safety
Fiscal Year 2025 102300
Mission
The City of Pittsburgh created the Office of Community Health and Safety to connect our most vulnerable
neighbors with the right services to make our city safer and more just. Our mission is to serve marginalized
communities that have been systematically isolated from society and victimized by an unjust system. Through the
tireless work of our frontline workers, public safety liaisons, and subject matter experts we aim to address the
needs of those living in poverty, experiencing homelessness or housing instability, substance use disorder, and
mental or behavioral health challenges.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
The Office of Community Health and Safety is focused on building a response continuum and developing
sustainable upstream interventions to address unmet community social service needs that often fall to Public
Safety personnel, who represent the 24/7 safety net response. Through partnerships and program development,
the Office will focus on:
Continuum of Support (COS)
Through continued collaboration with first responders and community members, analysis of calls for service,
mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and evaluation of existing models, the Office of
Community Health & Safety (OCHS) will improve upon the existing continuum of resources and responses to
address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public Safety partners. First
responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis will be utilized to
enhance this continuum. Co-Response, People In Need of Support (PINS), and the Trauma Survivor’s Assistance
Program (TSAP) constitute the Continuum of Support and additional information regarding each of those
programs is directly below.
Co-Response
The Co-Response program has been developed to provide the “right responders” to individuals who are
experiencing a mental health or behavioral crisis. Teams consist of a Community Social Worker and dedicated
Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officer who are dispatched to co-respond to individuals in crisis. Through trust-building
and the provision of services, Co-Response seeks to reduce the propensity for individuals who experience mental
and behavioral health crises to engage in violent behavior and become involved in the criminal justice system.
Through the reduction in use of force, the program also aims to increase both the officer and community
member’s safety. This will be supported by training Co-Response Officers on Crisis Response Intervention
Training (CRIT), a national best-practice model rolled out by the Department of Justice.
People In Need of Support
The PINS program developed as a partnership between the three Public Safety Bureaus and the Office of
Community Health & Safety. First responders identify and refer City residents who frequently utilize 9-1-1 services
to meet their basic needs, as well as individuals who may be vulnerable to harm and need follow up. Community
Social Workers and Public Safety liaisons conduct home visits to assess the health and social needs of these
residents and develop a plan to link the residents to services and resources (including CIT and FBI cases). High
utilizers also known as "frequent flyers" who disproportionately utilize 9-1-1 services place strain upon the
emergency response system. By connecting these individuals to long-term services and supports, we relieve
pressure on the systems in place to assist people who experience crises. Nationally, these programs are known to
provide systems-level cost-savings.
Trauma Survivors Assistance Program
The Trauma Survivors Assistance Program (TSAP) is a partnership between the Office of Community Health &
Safety (OCHS) and the three Bureaus of Public Safety. TSAP social workers engage with victims of crime and
survivors of trauma to provide emotional support and link them to appropriate trauma and crisis response services
to stabilize them and begin the process of healing. TSAP also provides community trauma response following
shootings and other instances of violence, providing a supportive debriefing space and linkage to resources in a
larger group setting.

Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD)
Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) is an effective, replicable, and equitable diversion method that
provides individuals with intense case management. It is a client-based approach that provides people with
substance use disorder and mental and behavioral health challenges, experiencing homelessness and poverty
with person-centered social services and intense case management focused on harm reduction and compassion
in lieu of criminalization. The goal of LEAD is to break with traditional methods rooted in coercion and punishment
to address the needs of individuals experiencing poverty, homelessness, substance use disorder, and mental and
behavioral health challenges. LEAD combats racial and ethnic disparities within the criminal-legal system that
have been perpetuated by harmful systems, stigmatization and lack of access to services. The initiative ignites a
pathway towards criminal justice reform specifically to end harmful policing and criminalizing minorities and
vulnerable populations. The mission of LEAD for the City of Pittsburgh is to reduce criminal-legal system
engagement, promote individual agency, and provide care and support to people who use drugs, people with
mental and behavioral health challenges, and people experiencing homelessness through person-centered social
services. LEAD will combat racial and ethnic disparities within the criminal-legal system that have been
perpetuated by harmful systems, stigmatization, and lack of access to services. LEAD is currently operating in
Zones 1 and 2 and will be expanding to other zones.
Post Overdose Support Team (POST)
The Post Overdose Support Team (POST) responds to overdoses with teams of certified peer recovery specialists
(CPRSs) and case managers to reach individuals at the time of interception with public safety personnel. The
response aims to enable the POST team to foster a connection that places the individual in a deescalated state
following the overdose, allowing us to begin the work of providing service connections that can lead to long-term
recovery. Many people who have overdosed refuse transport to the hospital by EMS. This affords the POST team
its opportunity. Trust-building that follows de-escalation is an integral initial step in order to facilitate the willingness
of the individual to continue to engage POST staff after EMS has departed. to ensure that the provision of service
connections and system navigation may continue. The responding team and follow-up case management staff
identifies its primary goals to support safety, recovery, and to provide service connections that aim to treat
substance use and/or co-occurring mental health disorders.
Reaching Out On The Streets (ROOTS)
The Reaching Out On The Streets (ROOTS) Program aims to reduce the prevalence of homelessness by
addressing the social determinants of health, opening opportunities for personal agency, and intervening in critical
moments of crisis to reduce criminal legal interactions, increase access to services, and reduce fatal overdoses.
ROOTS will incorporate two components at full implementation: street outreach and drop-in sites. The staffing
plan and organization align to support these programs. Interdisciplinary Zone Teams will meet the needs of
individuals within the hyper-local scope of available services. Interdisciplinary Zone Teams include members from
street outreach, sites, and diversion programs that coordinate participant care and are adaptable to complex
needs; such as, human services, drug and alcohol treatment, housing, healthcare, behavioral health, and criminal
legal navigation.
Community Engagement and Partnership
Continued community engagement, transparency, and accountability to the community and first responders is
critical to building trust and facilitating change in the current response continuum. OCHS will continue to sustain a
collaborative model of program development and evaluation, prioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits
are quickly addressed and used for growth. OCHS will partner with existing community organizations and
prioritize community members who have been harmed and may not engage in traditional meetings. Initial efforts
will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives focused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war
on drugs and systemic racism. The Office of Community Health and Safety community engagement team seeks
to build relationships and trust between the office and diverse communities in the City of Pittsburgh while
leveraging best practices in community outreach and community engagement. Staff will accomplish their mission
by developing programs and other initiatives in partnership with the community to enhance the quality of life,
safety, and security of our community.
Note: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.

implementation of the Real-Time Safety System (RTSS), including reducing the DART rate from Q3 2023
from 17 to 12, a 30% reduction, and yielding approximately $300,000 savings in reduced workers'
compensation claim costs.
• In addition to perennial preventative maintenance programs, Public Works has supported other
departments in providing services for residents, including finalizing the 412 Blvd of Allies project, opening
services to the public on November 18th, 2024, creating a home for the DOMI Bridge Maintenance
Division. Public Works has also coordinated directly with Public Safety and Allegheny County partners to
improve responsiveness for unhoused residents.
• Public Work has supported the Department of Human Resources and Civil Service through increased
coordination and responsiveness, resulting in greater diversity in hiring and promotions and reduced time
to contact candidates and hire new staff, and improved qualification requirements for promotional
opportunities.
• Employees have performed vacant property clean-ups at over 260 private properties this year, an
increase of over 300% from the 86 clean ups performed in 2023. This was accomplished without
investment in additional personnel and equipment.
• The department has improved operational capability through a series of staff-led trainings. Senior
leadership has conducted 15 "go-and-see" exercises and self-identified improvement practices in the core
services of Forestry, Administration, Heavy Equipment Operation, Facilities Maintenance, Vehicle

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Department of Parks & Recreation
Fiscal Year 2025 500000
Mission
The Department of Parks and Recreation serves to enrich the lives of city residents and visitors through a wide
array of programs and events that contribute to a safe and welcoming city where all residents thrive.
Specifically, we strive to:
• Create a vibrant community that provides older adults with the social, emotional, and physical resources
necessary to be able to stay safe in their home and community.
• Ensure that Pittsburgh’s children & youth have equitable access to quality educational and recreational
enrichment opportunities to help them thrive as they enter adulthood.
• Utilize our park assets to offer community wide programs and events that strive to be accessible and
welcoming to residents and visitors of all ages.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
The Department of Parks and Recreation accomplishes this mission through four core program areas that are
supported by an operations and administrative team. The Operations and Administration division has direct
oversight over fiscal and HR processes, planning for capital improvement projects, delivery of new programs and
initiatives, and the management of all departmental budgets and trust funds. A critical focus of the Operations and
Administration division is to coordinate with other City departments, the Office of the Mayor, City Council, and
external partners to ensure effective, efficient, and impactful delivery of programs to the public.
Our five core program areas include:
Recreation Programs – The Recreation Programs division is committed to providing opportunities for residents
and nonresidents of all ages to participate in directed recreational, educational, and enrichment-focused programs
and activities. This area includes the operation of our recreation centers and fitness gyms, organized CitiSports/
sports programming, activities at the Schenley Ice Rink and Mellon Tennis Center, and the implementation of
summer and after-school youth camps and programs. The recreation system has a specific focus on providing
services to families and opportunities for Pittsburgh’s youth to have a safe and enriching place during out of
school time hours.
Senior and Wellness Programs – CitiParks operates thirteen Healthy Active Living Centers which are focused
on improving the physical, intellectual, social, cultural, and financial health and interests of older residents. The
senior program partners with other area agencies in delivering quality health and wellness programs, and works to
address the needs of individuals as they age.
Food System Programs – In addition to the direct meal support that we offer to Seniors and Children, the
CitiParks Department also supports a number of initiatives that are focused on improving Pittsburgh’s food
system. This includes staffing the operations at four of the City’s Farmers Markets, supporting urban agriculture
through the City Farms Program, and implementing the newly created Pittsburgh Food Justice Fund.
Community Programs – Community programs and events are focused on activating our park and recreation
spaces to engage city residents in a whole host of enriching experiences. Our office of Special Events is charged
with hosting movies, music, races, and other key city events including the 4th of July and Light Up Night. Our
Community Enrichment team operates the Roving Art Cart, participates in special recreational programs, partners
with PPS Schools, and organizes and plans annual premier celebrations like Alphabet Trail & Tales and Track n'
Treat. A specific focus of this program area is the Rec2Tech initiative. This program focuses on the development
and delivery of technology focused programs, coding, and other tech-adjacent learning initiatives.
Aquatics Programs – The aquatics division is responsible for providing city residents with access to safe pools
and aquatic activity year-round. The aquatics division operates 18 City of Pittsburgh pools and 9 spray parks
during the summer months. In the off season the aquatics team operates the Oliver Bath House, scheduled to
complete renovation in fall of 2024, and partners with Pittsburgh Public Schools to host swim opportunities and
lifeguard trainings for Pittsburgh youth that may be interesting in becoming a part of the City’s aquatics team. In

addition to staffing the pools for open swim, the aquatics team offers learn to swim, water aerobics, and swim
team programming throughout the summer months.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Department of Mobility & Infrastructure
Fiscal Year 2025 600000
Mission
The mission of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is to provide the physical mobility necessary to
enable the social and economic mobility of the people of Pittsburgh through the management, design,
improvement and operation of the public rights of way.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is responsible for all aspects of transportation and city-provided
mobility services, including:
• Planning transportation and mobility systems, corridors, and network operations
• Managing the flow of infrastructure funding
• Developing policies to guide the use of public right-of-ways and management of transportation systems
• Managing the public right-of-way to ensure continued safe, efficient and productive use that respects and
implements city policies and public priorities
• Designing, operating and maintaining the transportation system for safe and efficient mobility of all modes
to sustain and grow a vital, thriving, and equitable Pittsburgh
• Designing and implementing street and other infrastructure improvements in collaboration with community
and public stakeholders
• Measuring and monitoring mobility performance with the goal of continuous learning and improvement
The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is comprised of three bureaus:
Planning, Policy and Permitting - The Planning, Policy and Permitting Bureau is led by the Assistant Director
and establishes the comprehensive vision, guiding policies and permitted uses of the urban mobility network and
public rights of way. It is comprised of three divisions:
• Planning - Oversees development of system plans and multimodal networks and collaborates on
implementation; develops conceptual design of transportation facilities; gathers and analyzes data on the
condition and use of the mobility system; coordinates with county and regional organizations and entities
to plan transportation infrastructure improvements and mobility systems; and serves as the initial point of
contact for public stakeholders and partners for general mobility concerns or initiatives. Additionally, the
planning division tracks development of the regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP),
development of the department’s submission to the city’s Capital Improvement Plan, and pursuit of grants
and other resources to support implementation of the transportation program.
• Policy - Develops, communicates and maintains policies for the use, management, design and oversight
of public mobility services, transportation facilities and public rights of way; manages demand on the
mobility system; and develops and maintains guidelines, standards, and processes for the use of public
rights of way and the operation of the system and mobility services.
• Permitting, Inspections and ROW Coordination - Issues permits for use of or activities in the public
rights of way in compliance with regulations and established policies; coordinates current and future
activities with public and private utilities occupying the public rights of way; and enforces right of way use
to ensure all activities in the public right of way are in compliance with established rules and regulations
and the Pittsburgh Code via the inspection process. The Permit Division coordinates the activities of
utilities in the public right of way to minimize disruption and optimize opportunities for cooperative
improvements.
Traffic Operations - The Traffic Operations Bureau is led by the Municipal Traffic Engineer and oversees the
operation of the overall transportation and mobility network. The Bureau includes four divisions:
• Traffic Design Division - The Design Division develops design standards and guidelines for
transportation facilities including travel way dimensions, assemblage, operation, markings, signage, and
other components. The Division is central in the determining design of facilities for vehicles, bicycles and
234 jasujazmudzinski

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Department of Mobility & Infrastructure
Fiscal Year 2025 600000
pedestrians. It provides programmatic guidance for complete street, safe routes to school and traffic
calming improvements.
• Signal Design Division – The Signal Division is responsible for designing the programming and
operational plans for more than 600 signalized intersections throughout the city and designing plans for
other devices such as school zone signs, rapid flash beacons, variable signs, and other elements. The
Design Division assists the Planning Bureau in reviewing land development projects and specifically
evaluating transportation impacts and necessary mitigations.
• Signs and Markings Division - The Signs and Markings Division fabricates, installs, repairs and/or
replaces pavement markings, and signage. It is responsible for striping more than 2,000 miles of long
markings, 10,000 marked crosswalks, and 850 traffic control and curbside regulatory signs. The Signs
and Markings Division is typically responsible for the implementation of designs generated by the Design
Division.
• Traffic Control Division - The Traffic Control Division performs necessary and routine maintenance on
more than 10,000 traffic signal heads and other electronic traffic control devices across the City to keep
them in operation.
Project Design and Delivery - The Project Design and Delivery Bureau is led by the Chief Engineer. The Bureau
is responsible for all of the major capital improvement projects for transportation or mobility infrastructure. This
includes not only street and bridge work, but also providing engineering services to address major slope failure
and flood control needs in the city. The Bureau is comprised of five divisions:
• Bridges and Structures Division - The Bridges and Structures Division manages structural assets in the
right-of-way including bridges, steps, and retaining walls. This work includes repair design, capital
planning, and implementation of capital rehabilitation and replacement projects from design through
construction. The division performs or contracts for condition inspection of structures in the public right of
way to ensure the safety of the traveling public.
• Streets Division - The Streets Division manages city streets, sidewalks, and trails that comprise the city’s
transportation network. Streets Division engineers manage preliminary and final engineering for complex
public infrastructure projects and construction services provided by City contractors. The Division
supports the Permit Division through review of restoration or alteration of the public right of way carried
out by private developments. Project Managers develop and maintain standards and specifications for
construction in the public right of way.
• Paving Division - The Paving Division oversees City resurfacing projects on public streets, trail facilities
and other public paved surfaces and the improvement of sidewalk ramps affected by this work. The
Division is responsible for resurfacing dozens of miles of streets every year in the city.
• Construction Division - The Construction Division of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure
addresses immediate needs for typically smaller scale improvements of infrastructure in the public rights
of way. The Division oversees work to repair, replace or rehabilitate curbs, sidewalks, curb ramps, steps,
walls, slopes and other similar projects. Division managers respond to emergency events that disrupt the
safe operation of the mobility system such as landslides, sink holes, and bridge strikes.
• Bridge Maintenance Division - The Bridge Maintenance Division performs routine maintenance and
small repairs using in-house staff for the city’s inventory of 145 bridges. The division also oversees and
inspects bridge repair work performed by city contractors.

City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Citizen Police Review Board
Fiscal Year 2025 999900
Mission
The Independent Citizen Police Review Board ("CPRB") promotes responsible citizenship and respectable law
enforcement through mutual accountability. The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide
independent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. To accomplish this assignment, the Board
will thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations;
evaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices
through public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor
and Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.
The Independent Citizen Police Review Board strives to improve the relationship between the community and the
Pittsburgh Bureau of Police by promoting transparency, integrity, and mutual accountability through individual
complaint investigations and reviews, public hearings, and the rendering of advice to the Mayor and Chief of
Police on individual complaints of police conduct, police policies, practices, and procedures to ensure all are
guided by the principles of justice, respect, and equity.
A Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the
staff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and
recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.
Departmental/Bureau Overview
Investigation and Complaint Disposition - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the
CPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake
Coordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of
the complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the
complaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a
preliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides
daily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and
the results are presented to the Board. The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an
investigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. Complaints may proceed through
investigation to a public hearing at the Board’s discretion. Findings and recommendations resulting from public
hearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board. Patterns emerging from
complaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the Board for consideration of policy
recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.
Community Education - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens
and police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and
civilian expectations of police conduct. Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and
personal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB’s
role and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the
public is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen
and the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as
offensive. The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the
process, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.
Board and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance,
including police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human
rights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior. Staff training
is designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops
mediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills. Staff adheres to the standards
and performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals.
Administrative - The Executive Director is responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the Board
and those of the City which affect the daily operation of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board. Activities

Grants Office
Grants Office
The City of Pittsburgh’s Grants Office is situated within the Office of Management and Budget and is tasked with
centralizing the City’s grant-seeking efforts as well as providing guidance and oversight to City departments in
managing their post-award grant administration and reporting processes.
The mission of the Grants Office is to increase the City’s capacity to compete for federal, state, county, corporate,
and foundation grants and to effectively assist in the full life-cycle of grant management from application to award
through closeout. The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City’s exposure to any grant-related legal
liability, and improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars.
The Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to
expand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City’s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant
funds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our
community. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain
technological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed
throughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services,
recreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows
the City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the
impact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant.
In 2024, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 30 new awards for a total of $20,229,310 in funding. In particular,
this year the City saw an influx of infrastructure opportunities that were pursued and received resulting in a
windfall of grant funds to DOMI. Some projects supported by this funding include a grant to install electric vehicle
charging infrastructure in our communities, construct safety and accessibility improvements along the Brownsville
Road Corridor and install multiple intersection improvements throughout the City. Additionally, grants were
received to support the City’s other departments including the renovation of Lewis Playground in Hazelwood and
vehicles for our Park Rangers.
