Mike Cornell and the staff at Frick Environmental Center want to get more people to utilize the parks in their Pittsburgh neighborhoods. Pittsburgh has over 640 acres of park land and includes 104 neighborhood parks. He says that a park is a “right and privilege” that should not be taken advantage of and all it takes is to walk out the front door.

Frick Environmental Center offers families, students, and learners of all ages a state-of-the-art space for hands-on, environmental education. There is also a STEM focus for its younger patrons. Mike Cornell, the Naturalist Educator, coordinates the volunteer naturalists and building docents.

Volunteer naturalists are the field educators of the center and offer their time and expertise to work the information desk, assist with school programs, and program development for community education for Frick Environmental Center. Volunteer naturalists are driven by their passion for nature and the environment, and Cornell wants to continue to support this program.

“If they are passionate about it, we can schedule and promote it so they can teach it. The parks and libraries are the two places where you can always go for free and the parks don’t have doors that lock,” he says

To be a Volunteer Naturalist, Pittsburghers must go through a seven week training where they will learn about park conservancy, effective presentation skills, and proper planning strategies for good educational programming. Previous classes have included nature photography, nature education for kids, and hiking skills. Cornell says classes like this can prepare an average citizen to appreciate and embrace parks into their everyday lives and schedules.

“You can get to the park and always enjoy the parks and you don’t have to have a membership. It can be your gym. It can be your classroom. It can be the place you unwind. It can be the place to read a book,” he says.

In 1897, after reading a New York newspaper report about the bones of a “colossal” creature found out West, Carnegie ordered then-museum Director William Holland to “buy this for Pittsburgh.” Unable to purchase a specimen, Holland, with the financial backing of Carnegie, dispatched a team to Wyoming in 1898. A year later, the group hit pay dirt: the well-preserved bones of a new species of dinosaur that would eventually be named after Carnegie, Diplodocus carnegii (aka, “Dippy”). But where would the museum put the gigantic creature once its scientists pieced him back together again?
By 1901, Carnegie committed to the expansion of his Institute, and plans for the addition that would become home to his namesake included a new foyer for the Music Hall, a Hall of Architecture, and a Hall of Sculpture. Cost estimates quickly went from $1.75 million, to $3.6 million, to a final cost of more than $5 million. Excavation began on November 1, 1903, and it took the better part of the next four years to complete the project. The new building, much as it stands today (without the Scaife wing, which was added in 1974), was opened with great pomp and circumstance on April 12, 1907.
It’s a sure bet that in late 2007, the celebration for the opening of Dinosaurs in Their World will be every bit as elaborate. But this time, Pittsburgh will be celebrating the return of Carnegie’s dinosaurs—in a setting bigger and better than even Andrew Carnegie could have ever imagined.

History of Carnegie Museums is bookended by two periods of fantastic growth.
It all started in November 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums. Andrew Carnegie called the grand building—which included Carnegie Music Hall and Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh—his “monument,” and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life.
A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International, second only to the Venice Biennale as the world’s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum’s collection of art quickly grew as a result.
To make room for the display of his namesake, Diplodocus carnegii, in 1904 Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums’ first major expansion. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the Hall of Architecture, best embodied Andrew Carnegie’s desire to “bring the world” to the people of Pittsburgh.
Carnegie Museums’ second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries, which gave Carnegie Museum of Art’s constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History added a number of new exhibit halls: Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife.
Three years later, in 1994, Carnegie Museums again brought something new and irreplaceable to Pittsburgh, and the world: The Andy Warhol Museum, the most comprehensive single-artist museum in the world, illuminating the art and life of one of the most influential American artists of the 20th century and serving as a global ambassador to Pittsburgh’s cultural richness and diversity.

The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, PA was cofounded in 1989 by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the Dia Art Foundation, and Carnegie Institute. Home to more than 500,000 objects, it is the largest repository of Warhol’s artwork and archival materials and among the most comprehensive single-artist museums in the world. Since opening to the public in 1994 in a converted historical warehouse, the museum has facilitated a proliferation of rigorous Warhol-related scholarship, research, and curatorial innovation, vastly broadening our understanding of the profound artistic and cultural impact of one of the most complex, influential, and mythologized cultural figures of the 20th century.
While the Foundation played a pivotal role in establishing it, The Warhol museum is an independent institution within the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh organization. The Foundation initially donated more than 3,000 artworks and films, as well as archives, personal belongings, and other ephemera from the artist’s estate to form the museum’s core collection and also awarded a $2 million grant to help fund architect Richard Gluckman’s conversion of the 1911 industrial building into a state-of-the-art space. The museum now occupies eight floors where Warhol’s art, films, videos, and archives can be properly preserved, closely examined, creatively exhibited, and better understood by a wider audience.
Shedding light on the full breadth of Warhol’s intense productivity, from the late 1940s through 1987, acclaimed works to lesser-known pieces that have been presented to the public for the first time. Warhol’s multi-dimensional creativity can be traced from the drawings he made while studying pictorial design at Carnegie Tech and the commercial illustrations he produced for Madison Avenue, to his groundbreaking Pop Art experiments with photographic silk-screens and innovations in portraiture, to his later collaborations with fellow artists and radical innovations in abstraction. Special galleries spotlight his extraordinary fixation on the moving image, represented by roughly 500 experimental films and more than 2,500 videos, including his TV talk shows and Factory Diaries—unedited footage of everyday life at his studio. In 1997, the Foundation transferred ownership of the rights to most of Warhol’s film and video work to the museum.
Equally significant are the museum’s holdings of Warhol’s archives and belongings. A notoriously devoted documentarian of daily life, he photographed, audio recorded, and videotaped thousands of social interactions and fleeting moments, both personal and professional. He was also an obsessive collector, saving periodicals, press clippings, posters, photos, and other ephemera. These vital historical records are preserved in the museum’s specially designed Study Center, along with 610 of Warhol’s Time Capsules (donated by the Foundation), which the artist began assembling in 1970 by tossing correspondence, receipts, bills, fan mail, exhibition announcements, phone messages, and other everyday tidbits into cartons, which he then sealed. In 2007, the Foundation provided the museum with a $625,000 grant to help fund efforts to unseal the boxes and archive the contents—a process that is still ongoing. The archives also include Warhol’s libraries, a full run of Interview magazine, and hundreds of personal items, including art supplies, 175 cookie jars, and several wigs.
Warhol would likely have approved of the museum’s encyclopedic task of preserving his belongings, and not because he thought his life was worthy of immortalizing. Rather, he was simply very fond of stuff. As he wrote in the Philosophy of Andy Warhol, “Just because people throw it out and don’t have any use for it, doesn’t mean it’s garbage.”

Early Industrial History
Throughout the 1800s, the Strip’s location and access to transportation made it ideal for industrial development. As early as the 1820s and 1830s, the Strip District was home to iron mills, foundries and glass factories. After the Civil War, industrial development flourished and new construction continued to move east, with factories lining the Allegheny River. The Strip District was the scene for a number of significant industrial “firsts.” Andrew Carnegie got his start in the iron and steel industries with the Upper and Lower Union Mills on Smallman and 33rd streets. The Pittsburgh Reduction Company, later ALCOA, began commercial production of aluminum in the 3200 block of Smallman Street. George Westinghouse built his first factory to produce air brakes in the 2400 block of Liberty Avenue.

The Strip is Wholesale
During the late 19th century, wholesale produce merchants began locating downtown along Liberty Avenue in the 600 to 900 blocks. Railroad tracks ran down Liberty Avenue. Trains stopped on the street and produce was unloaded directly into the warehouses. When plans were announced that the railroad tracks would be removed from Liberty Avenue downtown (this finally occurred in 1906), produce merchants began to move to the Strip District near the Pennsylvania Railroad yards. The produce station was located in a small triangular building at 21st Street near Smallman Street. In the early 20th century, this intersection became the hub of the wholesale produce business in Pittsburgh. From the turn of the century through the 1920s, industrial buildings, shops, and homes along Smallman between 16th and 21st streets were demolished for the construction of produce warehouses and offices. Auction houses and large wholesalers lined up along Smallman; smaller dealers set up shops on Penn Avenue in existing retail buildings. The 1920s were a time of prosperity, and grocery store chains began on a small-scale and helped increase the volume of business in the Strip District. Produce merchants faced difficult times in the 1930s. The Depression and the flood that hit Pittsburgh on St. Patrick’s Day in 1936 caused tremendous losses throughout the business.
jasujazmudzinski
Just as the wholesalers were beginning to pull out of the Depression, World War II brought about short supplies of food, rationing and price freezes. The post-war years brought two major changes to the produce industry. Trucks began to replace railroads as the preferred method of transportation, and grocery store chains continued to grow, putting small independent stores out of business and cutting out wholesalers by purchasing directly from growers. This put a double squeeze on wholesale merchants who lost both large and small customers. In the 1950s, there were 71 wholesale produce dealers in the Strip District. By the 1970s, there were about two dozen dealers left in the produce terminal. Remaining dealers began to expand their businesses by opening retail stores on Penn Avenue and Smallman Street.

A Colorful Journey
Randyland, tucked away in the heart of Pittsburgh’s North Side, is an artistic wonderland that unveils the extraordinary power of art in transforming not only spaces but lives as well. Amidst the vibrant tapestry of colors and creativity, the untold story of Randy Gilson, the founder, takes center stage. Born in the quiet town of Homestead, Pennsylvania, Gilson’s early life was marked by the harsh realities of homelessness and poverty. However, his path underwent a remarkable metamorphosis when he arrived in Pittsburgh in 1982. He emerged as a dedicated community activist, sowing the seeds of change by planting over 800 street gardens and cultivating 50 vegetable gardens in neighborhoods such as Manchester and the Mexican War Streets.
The Fascinating Dream
The inception of Randyland is a testament to unwavering vision and indomitable determination. In a bold and audacious move in 1995, Randy Gilson acquired the property that would eventually become the celebrated Randyland, all on a credit card with a mere $10,000. This audacious decision mirrors Gilson’s fearless approach to life and art. Employing upcycled materials and boundless creativity, Gilson meticulously transformed his humble abode into an extraordinary canvas. His artistic expression knew no bounds as he adorned the space with a mesmerizing array of mannequins, plastic dinosaurs, pink flamingos, and exuberant murals that depicted dancing and joyous neighbors.
Triumph Over Tragedy
While the colorful façade of Randyland draws visitors in, there exists a poignant chapter in its history. In late 2016, Randyland faced a profound test when Gilson’s partner, David Paul Francis “Mac” McDermott, received a devastating diagnosis of terminal prostate cancer. The news galvanized Randyland’s dedicated fanbase into action, raising over $20,000 to send the couple on a poignant and unforgettable vacation. Their journey took them to iconic destinations like the Grand Canyon and Hollywood, offering a bittersweet glimpse into the limitless possibilities of life. In the wake of this heartbreaking news, Randy Gilson decided to retire from his restaurant job to provide devoted care for McDermott in his final days. It was during this challenging period that Foo Conner joined Randyland as co-director, stepping into a crucial role.
The address of Randyland is 1501 Arch St, Pittsburgh, PA 15212. The hours of Randyland are 10 AM - 9 PM on Monday through Saturday and 12 PM - 9 PM on Sunday.

Our Story
The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania.
In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years.
Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections.
The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today.

Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. 
In 1996, the Senator John Heinz History Center moved and opened in Pittsburgh’s Strip District.
