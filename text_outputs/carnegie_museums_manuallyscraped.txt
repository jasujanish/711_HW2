Mike Cornell and the staff at Frick Environmental Center want to get more people to utilize the parks in their Pittsburgh neighborhoods. Pittsburgh has over 640 acres of park land and includes 104 neighborhood parks. He says that a park is a “right and privilege” that should not be taken advantage of and all it takes is to walk out the front door.

Frick Environmental Center offers families, students, and learners of all ages a state-of-the-art space for hands-on, environmental education. There is also a STEM focus for its younger patrons. Mike Cornell, the Naturalist Educator, coordinates the volunteer naturalists and building docents.

Volunteer naturalists are the field educators of the center and offer their time and expertise to work the information desk, assist with school programs, and program development for community education for Frick Environmental Center. Volunteer naturalists are driven by their passion for nature and the environment, and Cornell wants to continue to support this program.

“If they are passionate about it, we can schedule and promote it so they can teach it. The parks and libraries are the two places where you can always go for free and the parks don’t have doors that lock,” he says

To be a Volunteer Naturalist, Pittsburghers must go through a seven week training where they will learn about park conservancy, effective presentation skills, and proper planning strategies for good educational programming. Previous classes have included nature photography, nature education for kids, and hiking skills. Cornell says classes like this can prepare an average citizen to appreciate and embrace parks into their everyday lives and schedules.

“You can get to the park and always enjoy the parks and you don’t have to have a membership. It can be your gym. It can be your classroom. It can be the place you unwind. It can be the place to read a book,” he says.

In 1897, after reading a New York newspaper report about the bones of a “colossal” creature found out West, Carnegie ordered then-museum Director William Holland to “buy this for Pittsburgh.” Unable to purchase a specimen, Holland, with the financial backing of Carnegie, dispatched a team to Wyoming in 1898. A year later, the group hit pay dirt: the well-preserved bones of a new species of dinosaur that would eventually be named after Carnegie, Diplodocus carnegii (aka, “Dippy”). But where would the museum put the gigantic creature once its scientists pieced him back together again?
By 1901, Carnegie committed to the expansion of his Institute, and plans for the addition that would become home to his namesake included a new foyer for the Music Hall, a Hall of Architecture, and a Hall of Sculpture. Cost estimates quickly went from $1.75 million, to $3.6 million, to a final cost of more than $5 million. Excavation began on November 1, 1903, and it took the better part of the next four years to complete the project. The new building, much as it stands today (without the Scaife wing, which was added in 1974), was opened with great pomp and circumstance on April 12, 1907.
It’s a sure bet that in late 2007, the celebration for the opening of Dinosaurs in Their World will be every bit as elaborate. But this time, Pittsburgh will be celebrating the return of Carnegie’s dinosaurs—in a setting bigger and better than even Andrew Carnegie could have ever imagined.

History of Carnegie Museums is bookended by two periods of fantastic growth.
It all started in November 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums. Andrew Carnegie called the grand building—which included Carnegie Music Hall and Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh—his “monument,” and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life.
A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International, second only to the Venice Biennale as the world’s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum’s collection of art quickly grew as a result.
To make room for the display of his namesake, Diplodocus carnegii, in 1904 Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums’ first major expansion. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the Hall of Architecture, best embodied Andrew Carnegie’s desire to “bring the world” to the people of Pittsburgh.
Carnegie Museums’ second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries, which gave Carnegie Museum of Art’s constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History added a number of new exhibit halls: Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife.
Three years later, in 1994, Carnegie Museums again brought something new and irreplaceable to Pittsburgh, and the world: The Andy Warhol Museum, the most comprehensive single-artist museum in the world, illuminating the art and life of one of the most influential American artists of the 20th century and serving as a global ambassador to Pittsburgh’s cultural richness and diversity.
