Title: Summary

The Rodef Shalom Biblical Botanical Garden (0.3 acres) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 's Shadyside section is a Biblical botanical garden.
Opened and free to the public since 1987 from June 1 through September 15. It was founded by Rabbi Walter Jacob and his wife horticulturalist Irene Jacob. It now displays more than 100 plants once grown in ancient Israel, including cedars, dates, figs, olives, and pomegranates. All are labeled with biblical verses, or their biblical name. The garden also includes a waterfall, desert, and a representation of the Jordan River from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea.
